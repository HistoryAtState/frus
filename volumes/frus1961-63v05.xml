                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series
                    documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies
                    and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
                    positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the Foreign Relations series. The staff of the Office of the
                    Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans, researches, compiles, and edits the
                    volumes in the series. This documentary editing proceeds in full accord with the
                    generally accepted standards of historical scholarship. Official regulations
                    codifying specific standards for the selection and editing of documents for the
                    series were first promulgated by Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March
                    26, 1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102-138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President George Bush on October 28, 1991. Section
                    198 of P.L. 102-138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State's Basic
                    Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the Foreign Relations series be a thorough, accurate,
                    and reliable record of major United States foreign policy decisions and
                    significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series should
                    include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major
                    foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government. The
                    statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg:
                    the Foreign Relations series is guided by the principles of historical
                    objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions made
                    without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made; the
                    published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching
                    a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a
                    defect in policy. The statute also requires that the Foreign Relations series be
                    published not more than 30 years after the events recorded. The editors are
                    convinced that this volume meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly
                    standards of selection and editing.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Structure and Scope of the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>The superpower rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was central
                    to the foreign policy of the administration of President <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0004"/>
                    <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, and the editors of the Foreign
                    Relations series have recognized that centrality in the 25 volumes presenting
                    the official record of U.S. foreign policy during the
                        <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> years. The threat of Soviet expansion and
                    subversion of areas and relationships vital to the security interests and
                    well-being of the United States was the preeminent concern of the President and
                    U.S. foreign policymakers. The perceived need to counter aggressive Soviet
                    communism around the world dominated American foreign policy and dwarfed other
                    issues.</p>
                <p>Although mindful of how the cold war overshadowed American foreign policy in the
                    Kennedy period, the editors of the Foreign Relations series believe that the
                    events and decisions comprising these relations are better understood in the
                    particular regional or topical contexts rather than as part of a single
                    continuum of U.S.-Soviet relations. The editors decided to maintain the
                    long-standing structure of the series, which took account of the major
                    geographical regions defining U.S. foreign policy and presented documentation
                    that reflected American interests and involvements in those regions. The Foreign
                    Relations subseries for the <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                    years, 1961-1963, therefore seeks to reflect the emphatic preoccupation of
                    policymakers with U.S.-Soviet relations around the globe, while retaining much
                    of the geographical-topical structure of the series carried over from subseries
                    of volumes documenting how the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, Truman, and Roosevelt presidencies managed relations
                    with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                <p>Nineteen of the 25 volumes document various aspects of U.S-Soviet relations. Nine
                    set forth the core documentation on the major aspects of U.S.-Soviet relations
                    and conflicts: the basic record highlighted by the Vienna Summit meeting in June
                    1961 (volume V), the complete exchange of messages between President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> (volume VI), the efforts at arms
                    control (volume VII), the basic elements of national security policy including
                    the military component of U.S.-Soviet relations (volume VIII), the events
                    leading up to the October 1962 Cuban missile crisis and its aftermath (volumes X
                    and XI), negotiations and plans arising from the threat of war over Berlin
                    (volumes XIV and XV), and the threat of hostilities by Soviet-supported forces
                    in Laos (volume XXIV). U.S.-Soviet confrontation and competition are also
                    important elements in ten other volumes that document U.S. policies toward
                    Western Europe (volume XIII), Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean (volume XVI),
                    regional crises in South Asia (volume XIX), the Middle East (volumes XVII and
                    XVIII), and the Congo (volume XX), and the deepening civil war in Vietnam
                    (volumes I-IV).</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Principles of Document Selection for the Foreign
                    Relations Series</p>
                <p>In preparing each volume of the Foreign Relations series, the editors are guided
                    by some general principles for the selection of documents. Each editor, in
                    consultation with the General Editor and other senior editors, <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"/>determines the particular issues and topics to be
                    documented either in detail, in brief, or in summary.</p>
                <p>The following general selection criteria are used in preparing volumes in the
                    Foreign Relations series. Individual compiler-editors vary these criteria in
                    accordance with the particular issues and the available documentation. The
                    editors also tend to apply these selection criteria in accordance with their own
                    interpretation of the generally accepted standards of scholarship. In selecting
                    documentation for publication, the editors gave priority to unpublished
                    classified records, rather than previously published records, which are
                    accounted for in appropriate bibliographical notes.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Selection Criteria (in general order of priority):</p>
                <p>1. Major foreign affairs commitments made on behalf of the United States to other
                    governments, including those that define or identify the principal foreign
                    affairs interests of the United States;</p>
                <p>2. Major foreign affairs issues, commitments, negotiations, and activities,
                    whether or not major decisions were made, and including dissenting or
                    alternative opinions to the process ultimately adopted;</p>
                <p>3. The decisions, discussions, actions, and considerations of the President, as
                    the official constitutionally responsible for the direction of foreign
                    policy;</p>
                <p>4. The discussions and actions of the National Security Council, the Cabinet, and
                    special Presidential policy groups, including the policy options brought before
                    these bodies or their individual members;</p>
                <p>5. The policy options adopted by or considered by the Secretary of State and the
                    most important actions taken to implement Presidential decisions or
                    policies;</p>
                <p>6. Diplomatic negotiations and conferences, official correspondence, and other
                    exchanges between U.S. representatives and those of other governments that
                    demonstrate the main lines of policy implementation on major issues;</p>
                <p>7. Important elements of information that attended Presidential decisions and
                    policy recommendations of the Secretary of State;</p>
                <p>8. Major foreign affairs decisions, negotiations, and commitments undertaken on
                    behalf of the United States by government officials and representatives in other
                    agencies in the foreign affairs community or other branches of government made
                    without the involvement (or even knowledge) of the White House or the Department
                    of State;</p>
                <p>9. The main policy lines of intelligence activities if they constituted major
                    aspects of U.S. foreign policy toward a nation or region or if they provided key
                    information in the formulation of major U.S. policies, including relevant
                    National Intelligence Estimates and Special National Intelligence Estimates as
                    may be declassified;</p>
                <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0006"/>
                <p>10. The role of the Congress in the preparation and execution of particular
                    foreign policies or foreign affairs actions;</p>
                <p>11. Economic aspects of foreign policy;</p>
                <p>12. The main policy lines of U.S. military and economic assistance as well as
                    other types of assistance;</p>
                <p>13. The political-military recommendations, decisions, and activities of the
                    military establishment and major regional military commands as they bear upon
                    the formulation or execution of major U.S. foreign policies;</p>
                <p>14. Diplomatic appointments that reflect major policies or affect policy
                    changes.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources for the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>The Foreign Relations statute requires that the published record in the Foreign
                    Relations series include all records needed to provide comprehensive
                    documentation on major U.S. foreign policy decisions and significant U.S.
                    diplomatic activity. It further requires that government agencies, departments,
                    and other entities of the U.S. Government engaged in foreign policy formulation,
                    execution, or support cooperate with the Department of State Historian by
                    providing full and complete access to records pertinent to foreign policy
                    decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected records. Most but not
                    all of the sources consulted in the preparation of this volume have been
                    declassified and are available for review at the National Archives and Records
                    Administration. The declassification review and opening for public review of all
                    Department of State records no later than 30 years after the events is mandated
                    by the Foreign Relations statute. The Department of State and other record
                    sources used in the volume are described in detail in the section on Sources

                <p>In selecting documents for this volume, the editors have sought to present a full
                    if summary accounting of the overall nature and structure of U.S.-Soviet
                    relations together with a more detailed documentary record of those high-level

                    the diplomacy of the cold war.</p>

                    presidency. This is an unprecedented procedure for the Foreign Relations series.
                    It reflects the editors' conviction that users of the series require in one
                    volume a synthesis of what is spread over nine volumes documenting the 1961-1963
                    period.</p>
                <p>The editors have sought to include in this volume the intelligence context within
                    which U.S.-Soviet policymaking was conducted. Part of this context is made up of
                    the major intelligence analyses that examined Soviet economic, political, and
                    military strengths and intentions. More difficult to document is the continuous
                    daily, weekly, and monthly flow of intelligence reports, summaries, and analyses
                    within which U.S. policymakers worked. In order for readers to understand better
                    this intelligence backdrop, the editors have included in this volume selections
                    from the Current Intelligence Weekly Review that were disseminated widely to
                    U.S. Government officials and which reflect the kinds of evidence, concerns,
                    suspicions, and speculations that informed U.S. policymakers.</p>
                <p>Finally, the editors present in this volume a roundup of important bilateral
                    diplomatic negotiations on political and economic relations directly between the
                    two nations. The genesis of ground-breaking cultural agreements and the “Hot
                    Line” agreement both resulted from and were the means for some change in
                    U.S.-Soviet relations.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in
                    the case of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Memoranda of
                    conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation,
                    rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the Foreign Relations series
                    follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by guidance from the General
                    Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text is reproduced as exactly
                    as possible, including marginalia or other notations, which are described in the
                    footnotes. Texts are transcribed and <pb n="VIII" xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0008"/>printed according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical
                    documents in the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied
                    by the editors for each document included in the volume. Spelling,
                    capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except
                    that obvious typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and
                    omissions in the source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction
                    is set in italic type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in
                    the source text are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are
                    preserved as found in the source text, and a list of abbreviations is included
                    in the front matter of each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of
                    pages not declassified in their chronological place. The amount of material
                    omitted from this volume because it was unrelated to the subject of the volume,
                    however, has not been delineated. All brackets that appear in the source text
                    are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document's source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also provides
                    the background of important documents and policies and indicates whether the
                    President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every effort has been
                    made to determine if a document has been previously published, and this
                    information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic
                    Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the Foreign Relations statute, reviews records, advises, and makes
                    recommendations concerning the Foreign Relations series. The Advisory Committee
                        <pb n="IX" xml:id="pg_IX" facs="0009"/>monitors the overall compilation and
                    editorial process of the series and advises on all aspects of the preparation
                    and declassification of the series. Although the Advisory Committee does not
                    attempt to review the contents of individual volumes in the series, it does
                    monitor the overall process and makes recommendations on particular problems
                    that come to its attention.</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee has not reviewed this volume.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The final declassification review of this volume, which was completed in 1997,
                    resulted in the decision to withhold approximately .14 percent of the
                    documentation selected. No documents were denied in full. The remaining
                    documentation provides an accurate account of the policy of the U.S. Government
                    toward the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>The Information and Response Branch of the Office of IRM Programs and Services,
                    Bureau of Administration, Department of State, conducted the declassification
                    review of the documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in
                    accordance with the standards set forth in Executive Order 12356 on National
                    Security Information, which was superseded by Executive Order 12958 on April 20,
                    1995, and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>Under Executive Order 12356, information that concerns one or more of the
                    following categories, and the disclosure of which reasonably could be expected
                    to cause damage to the national security, requires classification:</p>
                <p>1) military plans, weapons, or operations;</p>
                <p>2) the vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, projects, or
                    plans relating to the national security;</p>
                <p>3) foreign government information;</p>
                <p>4) intelligence activities (including special activities), or intelligence
                    sources or methods;</p>
                <p>5) foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States;</p>
                <p>6) scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to national
                    security;</p>
                <p>7) U.S. Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities;</p>
                <p>8) cryptology; or</p>
                <p>9) a confidential source.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments.</p>

                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department's Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between
                    the President and Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the files of
                    overseas diplomatic posts. When this volume was being compiled, all Department
                    of State records consulted were still under the custody of the Department, and
                    the footnotes citing Department of State files suggest that the Department is
                    the repository. By the time of publication, however, all the Department's
                    indexed central (or decimal) files for these years were permanently transferred
                    to the National Archives and Records Administration (Archives II) at College
                    Park, Maryland. Many of the Department's decentralized office (or lot) files
                    covering this period, which the National Archives deems worthy of permanent
                    retention, will also be transferred from the Department's custody to Archives II
                    over the next several years.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have had full
                    access to the papers of Presidents <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>&gt;, and <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and other White House foreign policy
                    records. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the Presidential
                    libraries include some of the most significant foreign affairs-related
                    documentation from other federal agencies including the National Security
                    Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the
                    Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians also have access to records of the Department of
                    Defense, particularly the records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
                    Secretaries of Defense and their major assistants.</p>
                <p>The Central Intelligence Agency provides access to Department of State historians
                    to those records in the custody of that Agency and at the Presidential
                    Libraries. Access to records still retained by the Central Intelligence Agency
                    is defined by a May 1992 memorandum of understanding and subsequent
                    understandings with the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> History Staff, whose
                    members provide assistance and guidance to State Department historians in their
                    Foreign Relations research. Special thanks are due to Donald Steury of the
                    History Staff for his assistance in providing access in connection with this
                    volume.</p>
                <p>All of this documentation has been made available for use in the Foreign
                    Relations series thanks to the consent of these agencies, the assistance <pb n="XVI" xml:id="pg_XVI" facs="0016"/>of their staffs, and especially the
                    cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The following list identifies the particular files and collections used in the
                    preparation of this volume. The declassification and transfer to the National
                    Archives of these records is in process. Many of the records are already
                    available for public review at the National Archives. The declassification
                    review of other records is going forward in accordance with the provisions of
                    Executive Order 12958, under which all records over 25 years old should be
                    reviewed for declassification by 2000, except for file series exemptions
                    requested by agencies and approved by the President.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Indexed Central Files</hi>: Up to January 1963 the Department
                    of State used a central indexed decimal file system for a large part of its
                    records. For this volume the most important decimal files were:</p>
                <p>411.61: U.S. economic relations with the Soviet Union</p>
                <p>511.613: documentation relating to the exchange program with the Soviet Union</p>
                <p>610.6111: representational questions affecting the two countries</p>
                <p>611.61: general U.S.-Soviet relations</p>
                <p>761.00: political reporting on the Soviet Union</p>
                <p>In February 1963 the Department of State changed to a subject-numeric central
                    file system, which divided records into broad categories within which there were
                    subject and country breakdowns. The most important of these files for this
                    volume were:</p>
                <p rend="sourceparagraphtightspacing"> CON US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>:

                        detailed matters discussed in the body of this Estimate is frankly
                        acknowledged to fall well short of such a period. In respect of matters
                        where we have actually made five-year estimates the degree of certainty
                        falls off markedly for the later years. In the summary paragraphs which
                        follow we are dealing with the broader trends which will determine the
                        nature and magnitude of the challenge which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will present to US security in the years ahead. These we
                        believe are predictable in the main, although their particular
                        manifestations clearly depend upon unknown and imponderable factors, or even
                        upon purely fortuitous developments.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Present Soviet Outlook</p>
                    <p>2. One of the principal factors which will shape future developments is the
                        outlook of the Soviet leaders themselves. There are two essential aspects of
                        this. One is the Soviet leaders' belief, derived from the Marxist-Leninist
                        ideology which continues to dominate their thinking, <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0030"/>that their society and the non-Communist world are locked
                        in an irreconcilable struggle which must continue until their system comes
                        to dominate the world. There is no evidence at present to indicate that the
                        Soviets will come to accept a world system which assumes the genuine
                        coexistence of states and ideologies. For so brief a period as five years,
                        Soviet behavior and policy will surely be marked by fundamental hostility
                        toward the West, and especially toward the US as the principal obstacle to
                        the fulfillment of Soviet aims.</p>
                    <p>3. A second essential feature of the Soviet outlook in the current period is
                        its high confidence in the growth of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s power and influence. Looking back to the weak and
                        perilous position in which the new Communist regime found itself in 1917,
                        remembering all the internal and external trials it has survived, and
                        considering its growth in relative economic and military power over the last
                        20 years, the Soviet leaders are encouraged in their doctrinaire
                        expectations about communism's inevitable triumph. That it was a Communist
                        rocket which first ventured into space symbolizes for them that they are
                        marching in the vanguard of history. They think they see a response to their
                        doctrines and influence in the revolutionary turmoils of Asia, Africa, and
                        Latin America. They expect to associate the peoples emerging from
                        colonialism and backwardness with their own cause, mobilizing them against
                        an ever more constricted world position of the Western states. The relative
                        internal stability of the latter at present they see as only a transient
                        phase.</p>
                    <p>4. While hostility toward the West and confidence in the eventual outcome of
                        the world struggle will inspire Soviet behavior in the period ahead, we do
                        not believe that the result will be policies of recklessness. The Soviet
                        leaders recognize that Western resources remain great, and that the struggle
                        for Communist power in the uncommitted world will be prolonged. They are
                        particularly conscious of the hazards of nuclear war. Moreover, they have
                        numerous problems of their own within the Communist Bloc which may move them
                        to caution. Their policies will be marked by a persistent activism and
                        opportunism, but also by what they consider to be a due measure of caution.
                        More important, however, than the Soviet outlook and aims, especially since
                        these offer little hope for accommodation and genuine peace, are the
                        strengths and resources which the Soviets will be able to bring to the
                        pursuit of their aims.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Soviet Power Base</p>
                    <p>Economic Aspect</p>
                    <p>5. Perhaps the most firmly based of our estimates are those which relate to
                        the growth of Soviet economic power. The Soviet economy has the resources
                        and plant as well as the planning and directing mechanisms to insure steady
                        fulfillment of most of the goals in industrial expansion which the
                        leadership sets. The industrial targets of the Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965),
                        providing for 8.6 percent annual increase <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0031"/>in industrial output, will almost certainly be met ahead of
                        schedule. We estimate that by 1965 total investment will reach about
                        one-third of gross national product (<gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>),
                        as compared with the present US rate of about one-fifth of <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>. Only in agriculture, which is burdened by
                        a heritage of errors and neglect, will the regime fall well short of its
                        goals, but even here we estimate that output will increase by about 3 to 4
                        percent per year. The <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in 1959 was somewhat less than half that
                        of the US; it is growing about twice as fast and by 1965 will probably be
                        somewhat more than half of US <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>6. <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> is a rough measurement, however. More
                        important in terms of world power competition are the uses to which economic
                        resources are put. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> maintains a
                        defense effort judged to be of about the same magnitude as that of the US.
                        The dollar value of Soviet investment in industry in 1959 exceeded the
                        highest US figure, achieved in 1957. For purposes related to national
                        power—defense, science, foreign economic and political operations—the
                        Soviets are increasingly in a position to assign resources freely and
                        without agonizing self-denials. That they are able to provide the resources
                        for national power on a scale equivalent to the US is due to the virtually
                        absolute command which the leadership has over the disposal of resources. It
                        will continue to give the highest priority to purposes related to national
                        power in order to “overtake and surpass” the US. The Soviet regime has
                        bought economic growth and military strength at the expense of the living
                        standards of the Soviet people. But its resources are now great enough so
                        that it feels able to provide for improved living standards also. The
                        consumption level remains low but we estimate that per capita increases will
                        occur over the next five years at the respectable rate of four percent
                        annually. The Soviet challenge in the economic field will be increasingly
                        formidable, not because the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has any
                        chance of overtaking the US standard or style of living, but because Soviet
                        resources for the competition in power are already great and will continue
                        to grow rapidly.</p>
                    <p>Military Aspect</p>
                    <p>7. As indicated, military power has one of the first claims upon Soviet
                        resources. Our estimates on the development of Soviet military power until
                        1965 are far less certain than those on the Soviet economy. This is partly
                        due to unpredictable developments during a period of rapid change in
                        military technology. It is due more to gaps in certain kinds of critical
                        information about Soviet military programs. Although in recent years the
                        Soviets have released fuller economic data than previously, on essential
                        matters in the military field they continue to maintain a policy of extreme
                        secrecy, which they evidently view as a major military asset in itself.</p>
                    <p>8. The most significant development in the military field during the period
                        of this estimate will be the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
                        emergence from strategic <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0032"/>inequality,
                        primarily through the build-up of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        force, and also through development of its defense systems against nuclear
                        attack. The overcoming of an inferiority under which the Soviets have
                        operated throughout the postwar period is already having a profound effect
                        on Soviet attitudes and policy. It inspires the confidence remarked upon
                        above, has emboldened the Soviets to challenge the West on a vital issue
                        like Berlin, and has led them to engage the West in other areas around the
                        world formerly conceded to be beyond the reach of Soviet power.</p>
                    <p>9. The Soviet leaders will not be content with the gains in military power
                        they have made. They will seek, by intensive research and development
                        through the years ahead, as well as by equipping their forces with advanced
                        weapons as these become available, to acquire an advantage over the West. If
                        they succeed, they will press their advantage ruthlessly, though still
                        within what they would consider to be the limits of tolerable risk to their
                        own rule and system. It seems quite clear that in their present view both
                        sides are deterred from the deliberate initiation of general war as a
                        rational course of action. Moreover, with the weapons systems now on hand or
                        likely to be available during the next few years, the Soviets probably do
                        not count on acquiring an advantage so decisive as to permit them to launch
                        general war under conditions which would not gravely menace their regime.
                        Nevertheless, they are building their nuclear striking power with vigor, and
                        we believe that they will build a substantial missile force. What we can
                        learn of Soviet ideas suggests that their long-range striking capability is
                        thought of primarily in terms of deterrence, and of employment for a heavy
                        blow should the Soviets finally conclude that deterrence had failed, rather
                        than in terms of the deliberate initiation of general war.<note n="2" xml:id="d1fn2">The Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, USAF,
                            believes that the evidence of offensive missile and bomber production
                            and deployment shows a definite intent by the Soviet rulers to achieve a
                            clear military superiority at the earliest practicable date. He feels we
                            are entering a very critical twenty-four month period in which the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may well sense it has the
                            advantage. The Soviet leaders may press that advantage and offer the US
                            the choice of war or of backing down on an issue heretofore considered
                            vital to our national interests. [Footnote in the source
                        text.]</note>The Soviet missile force will also constitute an important
                        means of political pressure, even though it is never used in actual
                        combat.</p>
                    <p>10. In order to deal more effectively with the continuing bomber threat the
                        Soviets are incorporating a large number of surface-to-air missiles into
                        their air defense. They are now also doing large-scale research and
                        development on antimissile systems in the hope of obtaining an advantage in
                        this critical aspect of the future weapons balance. By the period 1963-1966
                        they will probably begin to deploy such a system, though its effectiveness
                        is uncertain. Soviet research and development effort will probably also
                        focus on the new threat presented by Polaris.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0033"/>
                    <p>11. Partly as a result of the increased security the Soviets feel they have
                        gained from their development of a variety of offensive and defensive
                        missiles, they have announced a major personnel reduction in their forces,
                        from about 3.6 to about 2.5 million men by the end of 1961. Barring a
                        serious deterioration in the international situation, we believe the cut
                        will be substantially carried out. We believe that tactical aviation has
                        already been cut by one-half and naval aviation by two-thirds, the latter
                        primarily through elimination of the fighter arm. However, the main weight
                        of the cut will fall on the very large ground forces. Even with the
                        reduction, the Soviets will still have substantial field ground forces: we
                        estimate nearly 1.5 million men organized in 65 divisions averaging
                        two-thirds strength and some 60 cadre divisions at about one-fourth
                        strength. The submarine force will become even more than it is today the
                        primary component of the Soviet Navy, and will include nuclear and
                        missile-carrying types suitable for strategic attack.</p>
                    <p>12. In sum, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will continue to
                        develop formidable military strength despite the personnel reduction. The
                        Soviet military posture is designed primarily, we believe, to deter general
                        war but also to fight such a war if necessary.<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3">The
                            Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, USAF, believes the Soviets seek
                            a clear military superiority. See his footnote to paragraph 9. [Footnote
                            in the source text.]</note> Equally, it is intended to bolster the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s power position and thereby to
                        promote its general policies. Soviet capabilities for limited war in areas
                        close to Bloc borders are obviously great, but for conflict in more distant
                        areas they are comparatively slight. We do not believe that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> intends as a matter of policy to conduct
                        limited war at remote ranges. However, we do not exclude that, with their
                        current tendency to political involvement in remoter areas, the Soviets may
                        seek to develop a greater capacity for intervening militarily, even if only
                        to establish a military presence, in such areas. A really effective ability
                        to do this would presumably depend heavily upon acquisition of base rights
                        and facilities under friendly political arrangements.</p>
                    <p>Scientific Aspect</p>
                    <p>13. The Soviets obviously understand that science has become one of the key
                        fronts in the world struggle, not only because of its relations to military
                        capability but also because it is a major element in great power prestige.
                        The scale of their effort, thanks to the heavy investment they made in
                        training scientists in past years, is probably now roughly on a par with
                        that of the US, at least in some fields of the basic sciences and in
                        critical areas related to weapons technology. Presumably the scope of Soviet
                        scientific activity will broaden as needs in these first priority areas are
                        met. The quality of Soviet scientific work in many fields is now such that
                        achievements conferring great prestige are as likely to occur in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as in any other country.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0034"/>
                    <p>Political Aspects</p>
                    <p>14. It is in estimating the political aspect of future developments within
                        the Soviet Bloc that the greatest imponderables intrude. The political
                        system within the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> itself is stable,
                        and it will almost certainly retain its totalitarian features. The regime
                        will not be openly challenged by the Soviet people, who, even though many of
                        them view it with apathy and ideological disillusionment, are in general
                        hopeful for improvement in the conditions of their life and patriotically
                        moved by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s achievements and its
                        position of world power. If there is change in the Soviet political system
                        it will come from the higher levels of the party and government. In the
                        relatively small group which constitutes the real governing class there are
                        some signs of a desire for more regular participation in policy making, and
                        for more reliance in policy execution on professional expertise instead of
                        party agitational methods. While <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has avoided or been obliged to avoid the
                        arbitrariness of Stalin, among those who surround him there are probably
                        some who would like to move still further away from the domination of one
                        man in the system. Given <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        age and state of health he may not survive as the dominating leader
                        throughout the next five years. His successor at the head of the Soviet
                        Government and party may be more restricted in the personal power he wields,
                        but in any totalitarian system political developments are likely to depend
                        heavily on the qualities and style which individual personalities bring to
                        the exercise of great and arbitrary power.</p>
                    <p>15. In the area of political developments within the Communist Bloc it is the
                        evolution of relations among the Bloc states which raises the greatest
                        uncertainties at present. In general, the states of Eastern Europe have
                        gained in economic strength and political stability in recent years, despite
                        the continuing alienation and resentment of large parts of their
                        populations. There seems little doubt that, with the more flexible and
                        indirect methods of control the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has
                        been employing since 1956-1957, it will be able to maintain a generally
                        effective hegemony. However, China has raised a fundamental challenge to
                        Soviet leadership of the Bloc. Even if some way is found to resolve the
                        issues posed by China's desire to pursue a more militant policy toward the
                        West, it raises the serious question as to whether the long-term unity of
                        the Bloc under Soviet leadership can be maintained. We believe that there is
                        a trend away from monolithic unity, and that in the long run, if China is to
                        remain within the Bloc, a looser relationship is bound to develop. The
                        future course of Sino-Soviet relations will obviously have profound
                        consequences for the nature of the challenge which communism poses for the
                        Free World. The <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0035"/>West may be faced
                        either with new dangers or new opportunities, or both.<note n="4" xml:id="d1fn4">The Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Department

                            that, in spite of Sino-Soviet frictions, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China will continue to be firmly allied
                            against the West and will render one another mutual support whenever an

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Policies Toward the Non-Communist World</p>
                    <p>16. The general Soviet strategy for carrying on the world struggle in the
                        present phase rests on two propositions. The first is that general nuclear
                        war must be avoided because the costs in physical damage and social
                        disintegration would be intolerable. The second is that the world position
                        and power of the “imperialist” states can be undermined by a persistent and
                        aggressive campaign waged by methods short of war—political struggle,
                        economic and scientific competition, subversion. Political struggle takes
                        the form of a constant agitation designed to capture and organize in broad
                        mass movements the sentiments which focus on the great issues of the current
                        period—peace, disarmament, anticolonialism, social justice, economic
                        development. By manipulating these issues and by dramatizing the growth of
                        Soviet power, the Soviets are also trying to align the governments of the
                        under-developed and uncommitted states with the Bloc, and against the West.
                        The Soviet leaders hope that the result will be a progressive isolation and
                        loss of influence for the Western powers, divisions among them, and a
                        decline in their ability to deal effectively with threats to their
                        interests. This is what the Soviets mean by “peaceful coexistence”—a
                        strategy to defeat the West without war.</p>
                    <p>17. This is not a strategy which aims immediately at the revolutionary
                        seizure of power by Communist parties and the setting up of Communist
                        regimes. The Soviets know that there are few countries where the Communists
                        are strong enough to undertake such action, and where they themselves could
                        count upon being able to deter intervention by non-Communist forces. The
                        “peaceful coexistence” strategy is aimed mainly at gradually eliminating
                        Western and building up Soviet influence around the world. The Soviets
                        naturally expect that conditions will thereby be created which are favorable
                        to the growth of Communist movements and which will sooner or later permit
                        the latter to acquire state power peacefully, or by revolutionary action if
                        necessary. Even though overt seizure of power is not now the main aim of the
                        Soviet strategy, over a five-year period situations might arise where the
                        gains from such action would seem important enough to the Soviets so that
                        they would be willing to depart from their present general line.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0036"/>
                    <p>18. The general line of Soviet policy estimated in the two preceding
                        paragraphs falls within a range which excludes, on the one hand, the
                        deliberate assumption of serious risks of general war, and on the other,
                        abandonment of active struggle against the West. Within these limits we
                        believe that the Soviet leaders will display both militancy and
                        conciliation, at various times and in various proportions as seems to them
                        most profitable. However, the Chinese challenge to Soviet authority involves
                        basic questions of foreign policy, and brings severe pressure to bear on
                        Soviet policy decisions. In trying to adjust to Chinese pressures, the
                        Soviets may go farther in the direction of militancy and risk-taking than
                        they otherwise would. On the other hand, if the Soviets should conclude that
                        the Chinese were pushing them towards unacceptable dangers, they might move
                        as a matter of temporary expediency toward a greater degree of stabilization
                        in their relations with the West than they would otherwise consider, though
                        without altering their long-term aim of establishing Communism throughout
                        the world.<note n="5" xml:id="d1fn5">The Assistant Chief of Staff,
                            Intelligence, USAF, agrees that the Chinese challenge to Soviet
                            authority will, undoubtedly, have its effect on Soviet policy toward the
                            non-Communist world; however, he believes that the relationship of
                            Soviet military power vis-à-vis the US is the essential determinant.
                            Further, as expressed in his footnote to paragraph 9, he believes that
                            should the Soviets feel that they have achieved a clear military
                            superiority, they are likely to adopt policies involving serious risks
                            of general war. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>19. As a general rule, we believe that the Soviets would consider that the
                        initiation of limited war with Soviet or even Bloc forces entailed
                        unacceptably high risks and political liabilities. However, it cannot be
                        excluded that situations will appear in which they would conclude that some
                        prize was great enough, and the military and political risks acceptable
                        enough, to justify resort to such action. The Soviets are aware, however,
                        that any limited war carries a danger of expanding into general war. We
                        believe, therefore, that their attitude toward the involvement of Soviet or
                        Bloc forces in local and limited war will be a very cautious one, and will
                        be governed by their estimate of the risks and advantages, both political
                        and military, in each situation. Even so, there is always a possibility that
                        they may miscalculate risks.</p>
                    <p>20. Negotiations with the Western Powers over outstanding issues are
                        conceived by the Soviets as one of the modes of waging the struggle of
                        “peaceful coexistence.” They hope that the pressures which they attempt to
                        build up against the West will result in concessions at the negotiating
                        table. Intervals of more accommodating behavior and appeals for relaxed
                        tensions are intended to encourage the making of such concessions. We expect
                        this alternation of pressure and accommodation to be the regular pattern of
                        Soviet behavior with respect to negotiation in the years ahead. Since the
                            <gloss target="#t_U21">U-2</gloss> incident in May 1960 the Soviets have
                        adopted a hostile and aggressive attitude which has made effective
                        negotiation <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0037"/>impossible. We believe that
                        within the next six months or so the Soviets are likely to moderate this
                        attitude and to attempt to get negotiations started again. It is also
                        possible, however, that on the Berlin issue, where negotiation has so far
                        failed to get them results, they will resort to intensified pressure and
                        threats in an attempt to force the West into high-level negotiations under
                        more unfavorable conditions.</p>
                    <p>21. We do not believe that the Soviets have a five-year plan for foreign
                        policy in the sense that they set themselves particular goals to accomplish
                        within a set time. Their policy is marked rather by an extraordinary
                        opportunism, and in recent years by rapidity of response and vigor in
                        execution. Over the next five years they probably look for new developments
                        favorable to their interests to occur in a number of areas, but more
                        especially in Africa, Latin America, Japan, Indonesia, and Iran. They
                        probably intend to give particular attention to establishing a diplomatic
                        and economic presence in Africa, to stimulating and exploiting movements on
                        the Castro model in Latin America, and to encouraging the growth of a
                        radical anti-American mass movement in Japan. Above all, however, they
                        intend to build up their base of power within the Bloc itself, in the belief
                        that during the next several years they can considerably improve their
                        relative power position vis-à-vis the West. They believe that if they do so,
                        more opportunities for Communist expansion, and more readily exploitable
                        ones, will open up for them.</p>

                    <p>Before Senator <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s inauguration,
                        he told <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to make me coordinator of
                        the conversations that Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> was attempting to hold with various private
                        American individuals. This was quite an assignment. “Smiling Mike” had
                        embarked on a campaign of trying to talk to everybody whom he thought might
                        ultimately have some close association with
                        <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                    <p>I went to the Ambassador's residence on January 5, 1961 and after much
                        drinking and eating, I left and made this report to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName>:</p>
                    <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0038"/>
                    <p>“At Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName>'s invitation,
                        I lunched with him today. He said he welcomed the opportunity to talk
                        unofficially with an American private citizen, and assumed the gist of his
                        remarks would be conveyed to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>.
                        His official contacts were, of course, with Secretary Herter. He recognized
                        the impediments to conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> before the latter was inducted into office. He had seen
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>, and would appreciate word
                        being passed to him that he, <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName>, after reflecting upon their interviews, was now
                        ready to express his reaction to certain points discussed by them. (N.B.
                        Would you please pass this on to Chet <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>?).</p>
                    <p>“At another time, the Ambassador referred to conversations that had taken
                        place with <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Adlai Stevenson</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert Kennedy</persName>. He expects to see
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> again shortly. (He did not mention to me
                        his request for a visit to Senator <persName>Kennedy</persName>.)</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> observed that he was an
                        intimate acquaintance—indeed friend—of Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> and, to a lesser degree, of Kozlov. He had commenced
                        his career in trade and commercial matters, becoming later a diplomat. He
                        thought that expansion of trade between the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. was of
                        great importance, but did not propose to deal with that subject at this
                        time.</p>
                    <p>“His principals—especially <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>—believed the coming into power of a new American
                        administration presented an opportunity to resolve existing and dangerous
                        differences between our countries. The atmosphere had changed.
                        Psychologically, it would be easier for the U.S.S.R. to deal with the new
                        Administration than with the old one. He realized nothing could be
                        negotiated until the Presidency changed hands, but, as soon as possible
                        thereafter, serious inter-changes should begin. Meanwhile, he hoped to
                        continue informally to set forth Soviet views as he was now doing.</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> felt that, with due regard
                        to the susceptibilities of smaller nations on each side, no real relaxation
                        of tensions could be achieved until the only two great powers agreed upon a
                        program for peaceful coexistence. There are two outstanding problems: first,
                        in order of importance, is disarmament; second, the German question,
                        including West Berlin. This is not to minimize the necessity of dealing with
                        other sources of contention, which should also be considered as urgent. (He

                    <p>“Regarding disarmament, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        believed there were no fundamental differences between us, as both nations
                        realized the utter and criminal folly of a nuclear war. Perhaps the quarrel
                        over inspection and control preceding an agreement on general and complete
                        disarmament was due to a misunderstanding, or was a matter of semantics. At
                        any rate, if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could have a
                        private conversation with President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> they could reach a compromise on a system of
                        inspection and control synchronized with stages of disarmament.</p>
                    <p>“Regarding Germany, <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> confined
                        his remarks to Berlin, and repeated in essence what he had said to <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Adlai Stevenson</persName>. I told him previous
                        suggestions by his Government did not seem to promise a solution
                        satisfactory to us. He answered that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was flexible on the subject, and believed he
                        could work out something mutually satisfactory in private talks with
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                    <p>“He came back and back to the desirability and urgency of the two Chiefs of
                        State meeting, and hoped this could happen before President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> saw <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, the first of whom had been announced as a visitor to
                        Washington in February, and the second in March. I said the report about
                            <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> was incorrect, since his
                        proposed trip had been cancelled. I had no information about <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>'s plans, but was not aware of a
                        definite time having been set for him to come to Washington.</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> agreed that we would have
                        to await the formal taking over by the new Administration before
                        consideration could be given to the possibility of a meeting between the two
                        statesmen. I reminded him of the sentiment prevalent here, of the necessity
                        of preliminary agreements broad enough to warrant a later conference between
                        two or more Chiefs of State. <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> replied that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> thought preliminary understandings could be
                        reached but did not specify how. He said he was sure <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would be glad to receive a
                        representative of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                        in Moscow to engage in preparatory discussions. I asked if this could be
                        done through normal diplomatic channels. He answered that such a procedure
                        had not been followed in the past, and thought letters between the two
                        Chiefs, and perhaps a special emissary from President <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0040"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, might be better. However, he
                        was careful to add this was an entirely personal opinion. He felt himself
                        capable of handling the Washington end, since he had always been kept
                        informed by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> of the
                        contents of all private communications between <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>. He asked whether Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> would remain in Moscow. I
                        answered that I did not know.</p>
                    <p>“He referred to the difficulties, of which he was aware, on the Western side
                        especially, of bilateral conversations between the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R.
                        Heads of State, but thought, by the exercise of tact, they could be
                        overcome, as would also be the case with disarmament discussions, which
                        would have to receive the eventual approval of a United Nations
                        Committee.</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> started to talk about U.S.
                        mistakes in Laos and Cuba but, after some jocularity over Castro, I told him
                        I thought we better disregard those areas.</p>
                    <p>“He asked if I would renew this talk on a weekly basis. I said I would see
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> Saturday and give him an
                        answer Monday, since it might or might not be preferable to make some other
                        arrangement.</p>
                    <p>“He then handed me the enclosed paper,<note n="3" xml:id="d2fn3">Not
                            found.</note> asked me to read it and, if I wished, to pass it on. It
                        was his personal production and entirely unofficial. I read it hurriedly,
                        and said I would not comment on it today, though, off-hand, I did not
                        personally find his comments on the German question constructive.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> sent me a hamper of vodka
                        and caviar and invited me to lunch again. I went a second time, but found
                        his conversation a repetition of what he had said before. During the
                        remainder of my stay in Washington, he suggested I meet him again, but I
                        replied that, since the Secretary of State had taken office I thought I
                        should drop out of any future discussions on the matters with which he was
                        concerned.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">East-West Relations</p>
                    <p>At the Cuban National Day reception on 2 January, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said the delay in establishing contact with the
                        new US administration was largely responsible for the Soviet party's
                        decision to postpone its 22nd congress until October, according to the
                        Yugoslav ambassador in Moscow. At the same reception First Deputy Premier
                            <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> remarked that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did not expect to meet with
                        President-elect <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> until “perhaps July.”</p>
                    <p>This link between the timing of the party congress and top-level East-West
                        talks suggests that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> hopes
                        to achieve some tangible diplomatic success which could be used to
                        demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of his foreign policy before
                        committing the Soviet party to the kind of authoritative and long-range
                        programs that are enunciated by party congresses. The Soviet leaders may
                        also feel that the Chinese Communist challenge makes it imperative that the
                        party congress take unequivocal positions on doctrinal as well as foreign
                        policy questions, and that this will be impossible until the Soviet leaders
                        have an opportunity to assess the character and likely moves of the new US
                        administration.</p>
                    <p>The new date for the party congress—17 October—and <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>'s reported reference to a meeting
                        with the new US President in July suggest that the Soviet leaders are aware
                        that the process of arranging a summit conference will require considerably
                        more time than <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> indicated
                        in earlier private remarks. In talks with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> last fall, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> mentioned February and March as
                        possible dates for a summit; later he indicated to the West German
                        ambassador that April would be the deadline for talks on Germany.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s latest private remarks
                        along this line suggest, however, that he will initially press for early
                        negotiations. He used a talk with the Icelandic ambassador on 4 January to
                        emphasize his public statement <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0042"/>that
                        the Berlin problem must be solved in 1961. Unless the new US administration
                        gave an early indication of willingness to negotiate, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> told the ambassador, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would proceed with a separate peace
                        treaty with the East Germans.</p>
                    <p>As is often the case when discussing the Berlin question with Western
                        diplomats other than the three Allied powers, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> tried to cast doubt on the firmness of Western
                        reaction to a separate treaty. He said he was convinced that the Western
                        powers, with the possible exception of Bonn, were not prepared to fight over
                        West Berlin and claimed that even <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> had told him it was natural that Berlin should be
                        under Soviet influence. Admitting that a separate peace treaty could
                        precipitate a crisis, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        added that tensions would ease after a time and the new situation would
                        gradually be accepted.</p>

                        As a result of <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s talks with
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, the East Germans feel
                        that a summit is not likely until this summer and that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will sign a separate peace treaty if
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> fails to achieve his
                        objectives on Berlin through direct negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> reportedly assured <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> that the Berlin question would be
                        solved in 1961.</p>
                    <p>Moscow's relative restraint on Berlin which was evident in the Communist
                        position during the negotiations renewing the Soviet and East German trade
                        pacts with Bonn was again reflected in Moscow's reply to the US note of 26
                        October protesting East German statements and actions concerning Berlin. The
                        Soviet note of 7 January was brief, devoid of polemic, and merely confirmed
                        the Soviet position as presented in the 26 September note.<note n="2" xml:id="d3fn2">For text of the Soviet note of September 26 and the U.S.

                            The January 7 Soviet note was transmitted to the Department of State in
                            telegram 1570 from Moscow, January 7. (Department of State, Central
                            Files, 762.0221/1-961)</note> In response to an earlier US protest, the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> declared at that time that East
                        Germany exercised full power on the territory lying under its sovereignty,
                        “including in its capital.”</p>
                    <p>The brevity of the latest Soviet note also appears intended to close out the
                        exchange over East German restrictions on West German travel into East

                        weeks ago urging them to suggest to you or discuss with you sometime what
                        seems to me the most important first thing that this administration has to
                        do—and that is to discover what is in <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss>'s
                        mind, if possible. There's only one way I know of and this would be by
                        direct talks in Moscow without formality by somebody who is not the
                        diplomatic agent but someone who corresponds to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s concept of power. That is, a political figure
                        rather than a diplomatic one; someone who would go there after the
                        inauguration as your emissary to review the situation and exploit what
                        opportunities there may be. I think it is important to find out what his
                        troubles are—as well as to explore with him ours. I am told one trouble of
                        his may be his health—which we don't know anything about.——extremists in the
                        Presidium and China—and what he has to deal with. I think we will not find
                        anyone easier to deal with than <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> is. I think
                        it is important to find out whether he wants to expand the cold war——if we
                        make proposals on general and complete disarmament—how are we going to
                        proceed—does he want an effective U.N., or is he determined to destroy
                        it?——I know how he reveals himself in conversation—and it could be this
                        could determine quite a good deal, especially if he wants to do
                        business.——What we want to do is discover some means of creating a favorable
                        world order and we must explore the kind of thing we could do—for example,
                        if they would make a gesture of releasing the B-47 pilots<note n="3" xml:id="d4fn3">A reference to the two surviving crew members of an RB-47
                            that was shot down by the Soviet Union on July 1, 1960.</note> we could
                        with grace make a gesture in their direction. It would be helpful if Zorin
                        at the U.N. got some new instructions and we could have a more profitable
                        meeting in the Spring than we had in the Fall. I think they have been taking
                        the initiative too long now. This would recapture the world's imagination
                        which is one of the first jobs to be done—and I don't think we can do it by
                        being too cautious. I think this is one of the things that you should talk
                        over—I haven't been able to get <persName corresp="#p_DAH1">Dean</persName>.</p>
                    <p>K: We should talk about the desirability of bringing <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> home right away to report, then
                        we can talk to him and see what best way we can proceed from there.</p>

                    <p>K: Who would be best one to talk to <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss>?</p>
                    <p>S: I think the unhappy thing is the best one is me. But I haven't wanted to
                        suggest this and it would come at an awkward time—but I would do this if it
                        were deemed wise and helpful—and I would put other things aside. The
                        alternative would be <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>—he has
                        disadvantages in view of the fact he always insists on talking—and has
                        difficulty in hearing.</p>
                    <p>I think it would be best to send someone <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss>
                        knows and with whom he has had dealings before—someone he would be quite
                        sure would represent you—someone influential—not just a personal
                        diplomat.</p>
                    <p>K: Good. We will have a chance to talk before we come to a final judgment on
                        this?</p>

                        A. Soviet Progress and Policy,” and “II. The Communist World: B. Chinese

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Sino-Soviet Relations and the Future of
                        Communism</p>
                    <p>25. The character of Sino-Soviet relations in the years ahead will have a
                        profound effect upon the future of communism and thereby on the world
                        situation. The quarrel with Peiping has put the Soviet leaders in a
                        difficult situation. They cannot condone Chinese contumacy without losing
                        control of the Communist movement. They cannot permit an open break without
                        losing what influence they still possess over the Chinese and without
                        gravely weakening the international Communist movement as a whole. The
                        Soviet leaders would consider an open break calamitous, but we do not
                        believe that they would go so far in trying to avoid it as to surrender to
                        the Chinese position; both the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
                        determination to preserve its supremacy in the Communist movement and Soviet
                        national interest in avoiding serious risk of general war would preclude
                        such a course. We also do not believe that the Chinese would submit fully to
                        the Soviet position; their pride, self righteousness, and national
                        aspirations are too heavily committed to permit it.</p>
                    <p>26. The issues between the partners are basic, and will probably not be
                        resolved in any clear-cut fashion. The meetings in Moscow in November, 1960,
                        clearly did not produce a complete agreement, or one which is likely to be
                        lasting. The estrangement seems likely to continue, with ups and downs as
                        new issues arise and temporary solutions are developed, and possibly moving
                        toward a looser connection. If the Sino-Soviet relationship does in fact
                        develop in this way, there will probably be a tendency for recurrent
                        stresses and strains to weaken the Communist world posture and to diminish
                        the effectiveness of world communism outside the bloc. In particular,
                        factionalism would be stimulated in the Communist movement, with parties or
                        factions in various countries tending to identify either with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or with Communist China. The two
                        countries <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0046"/>would compete with each
                        other for influence in a variety of arenas, from revolutionary movements to
                        world organizations. A further widening of the Sino-Soviet split, if it
                        should occur, would dim the image of the bloc as a great and growing power
                        center and thus reduce the pressure upon peripheral countries to accommodate
                        to the Communists.</p>
                    <p>27. The cohesive forces between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                        China are strong, and we believe that the two states will not abandon their
                        alliance against the West. The Soviet leaders would be confronted with a
                        most serious dilemma, however, if the Chinese pursued independently such a
                        militant policy as to become engaged in a major war. Caught between a desire
                        to avoid Soviet involvement, with its attendant dangers, and desire to
                        preserve a Communist state, with its attendant opportunity to re-establish
                        Soviet influence in China, the Soviet leaders might tend toward the latter
                        course. Thus a wider Sino-Soviet divergency would not necessarily lead to a
                        less dangerous world.</p>
                    <p>28. It is impossible to predict with confidence the course of Communist
                        policy in the decade ahead, particularly in the light of the uncertain
                        future course in Sino-Soviet relations. We believe that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will stick to its present policy of
                        seeking to win victories without incurring serious risks, and of alternating
                        or combining shows of anger and bellicosity with poses of reasonableness and
                        compromise. We say this largely because we believe that the relationship of
                        power between the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will cause
                        the Soviet leaders to desire to avoid general war, and that within the
                        limits which this desire places on their action there will be constantly
                        shifting ideas of the potential risks and gains involved in the various
                        situations which will arise. A danger exists, of course, that in assessing
                        the risks involved in particular situations or proposed courses of action,
                        the Soviet leaders might overestimate their position while underestimating
                        that of the West. In particular, they might misjudge Western will and
                        determination in the face of Soviet threats or encroachments. Such a
                        political miscalculation could lead to the incurring of serious risks
                        without the intention to do so; it could even lead to general war.</p>
                    <p>29. We believe that China will persist in pressing the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for a more militant bloc policy. It will
                        continue its hostility to the US, and as it becomes stronger—especially
                        after it acquires a nuclear capability—it might press its objectives much
                        more aggressively than at present. On the other hand, the Chinese have in
                        recent years assessed risks carefully, and despite their bellicose talk they
                        have refrained from actions which involved serious risk of large-scale
                        military operations. Thus, their militancy has been tempered by some degree
                        of prudence, and this tendency toward prudence might in time become somewhat
                        stronger as they become more familiar with the dangers of nuclear war and as
                        they come to recognize the vulnerability of their developing industrial
                        capacity. On the whole, however, we do not expect a general shift in the
                        Chinese domestic <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0047"/>or world outlook for
                        some time to come, and Chinese militancy will continue to create a serious
                        danger of local or general hostilities in the Far East, and even of general
                        war.</p>
                    <p>30. Over the next decade at least, there appears to be a greater likelihood
                        of flexibility in Soviet than in Chinese policy. The Soviet leadership's
                        desire to prevent a general war, the wider range of Soviet contacts with the
                        outside world, the continuing pressure at home for liberalization, and the
                        growing capacity of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to provide its
                        citizens with a more comfortable life—these factors taken together may tend
                        toward moderation in foreign policy and toward a recognition of some areas
                        of common interest with the West. It is even possible that the Soviet
                        leaders will come to feel that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has
                        little in common with China except an ideology which the Chinese interpret
                        in their own way, and that by 1970 Communist China, with nuclear weapons and
                        a population of almost 900 million, will be a dangerous neighbor and
                        associate.</p>
                    <p rend="center">III. The Emerging Areas</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. The Political and Social Milieu</p>
                    <p>31. It is one of the key points in the Soviet estimate of the world situation
                        that conditions are favorable for Communist gains in the colonial and
                        ex-colonial areas of the world; there is much to support this Soviet view.
                        The nationalist revolutions in such areas as Africa and the Arab states have
                        been directed largely toward revamping political and social systems in order
                        to modernize societies and to achieve a place in the sun. The Communist
                        revolutions in Russia and China arose from broadly comparable aspirations.
                        Indeed, the system in these countries is widely admired in the newer nations
                        of the world because it has been demonstrably effective in achieving rapid
                        modernization, while the West is associated in their minds with the
                        colonialism which they blame for most of their problems and miseries, both
                        real and fancied.</p>
                    <p>32. Many of these countries in emerging areas—especially in Africa and the
                        Middle East—are in the charge of revolutionary-minded leaders; in others of
                        them such leaders are making a bid for power. These leaders are members of
                        an intelligentsia who have frequently had an education along Western lines,
                        some of it in military schools, and who have become aware through travel and
                        education—or through observation of the mode of life of Westerners in their
                        midst—of the backwardness of their countries and the poverty of their
                        people. Out of a sense of obligation, frustration, and impatience, they have
                        adopted a revolutionary attitude or taken revolutionary action against the
                        old order—whether it was colonial or indigenous. Despite the Western nature
                        of their youthful training, they tend to be resentful of Western influence
                        and critical of Western methods. They therefore are tempted by communism
                        insofar as it is anti-Western and an effective method of bringing about
                        rapid change.</p>
                    <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0048"/>
                    <p>33. Nevertheless, the revolutionary intelligentsia are generally chary of
                        embracing communism. Some of them have accepted Communist advisers, economic
                        aid, and diplomatic support, and some have even sided with the Communists
                        against the West. But, for the most part they do not wish to accept all that
                        now goes with the Communist ideology—the goal of a classless society,
                        wholesale social reorganization, Soviet interference in or dictation of
                        domestic policy, complete identification with the Soviet Bloc in
                        international politics, and exclusion from Western economic aid and
                        technical assistance. Moreover, many of them have become aware of their own
                        nation's history—in some cases a distinguished history—and they see
                        themselves as national figures capable of resurrecting some features of that
                        past and binding them into the new fabric being created. Thus, they see
                        themselves, not as capitalists, Communists, or exponents of any other
                        borrowed ideology, but as nationalists carving out their own destinies and
                        selecting from the past and from other societies the elements with which to
                        fashion new states and new societies of their own.</p>
                    <p>34. There are, of course, wide variations within the emerging world, not only
                        as among major areas—Latin America is quite different from Africa—but even
                        within major areas. There are wide diversities of all kinds in social
                        structure, degree of advancement, extent of revolutionary feeling, degree of
                        pressure upon available resources, extent of implantation of Western
                        institutions, and cultural backgrounds. Whereas Latin America is Christian,
                        is predominantly Western in language and culture, and has a long history of
                        independence, Africa is a melange of languages, religions, and cultures, and
                        is only now emerging from foreign domination. Even within a continent such
                        as Latin America, there are societies which have passed through a major
                        social revolution and others which still possess small social elites and a
                        large mass of illiterate and poverty-stricken peasants and tribes.</p>
                    <p>35. There is, however, a large common denominator in the underdeveloped
                        world. This is the political and social instability which is either manifest
                        or dormant and which arises from the rapidity with which knowledge is
                        growing and from the revolutionary manner in which large numbers of people
                        are reacting to the changes in the world around them. Nearly all the nations
                        of the underdeveloped world—whether in Southeast Asia, South Asia, the
                        Middle East, Africa, or Latin America—are beset by problems springing from
                        population growth, lack of development capital, rising popular expectations,
                        internal political strife and competing ideological pressures, lack of
                        political prowess and administrative and technical competence, and an
                        inadequate sense of national identity. While some states, especially those
                        barely emerging from tribalism, as in Africa, suffer more intensely than
                        others from these assorted ills, even states such as India and the more
                        advanced Latin American <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0049"/>countries
                        confront several of them to a most serious degree. Many states have adopted
                        strongly socialist methods; some have held to constitutional methods of
                        government with only the greatest difficulty; some have thrown out bloody
                        dictators only to acquire equally distasteful successors; some have taken
                        halting and others more dramatic steps toward the establishment of
                        democratic governments.</p>
                    <p>36. In states confronted by these enormous problems, the tendency toward some
                        blend of authoritarianism and socialism seems likely to continue.
                        Revolutionary leaders attempting to deal with backwardness, tribalism,
                        feudalism, corruption, economic pressures, and ineptitude often have no
                        alternative but to stifle political opposition. Western states which set
                        store by economic individualism and political freedom will probably be
                        increasingly shocked by methods which will be adopted, but in the eyes of
                        local leaders Western standards of political and economic conduct are likely
                        to be irrelevant to the problem. Revolutionary leaders are likely to expect
                        the West to judge them more by what they are trying to do than by the manner
                        in which they are doing it. If the West does not understand and help them,
                        they will tend to rely more and more heavily upon the Communists, until a
                        point is reached when they can no longer extricate themselves from the
                        Communist embrace.</p>
                    <p>37. Of all the problems confronting these nations that of the relation
                        between population and economic growth may be the most difficult. Indeed,
                        population growth is a grave world problem, with present rates making for a
                        doubling of the world's population every 35-50 years. In 1930 the world
                        population was two billion; today it is three billion; in twenty years it
                        will probably be four billion; in forty years it may be six or seven
                        billion. Growth is most rapid in the underdeveloped areas, where nearly
                        everywhere it exceeds two percent a year. Ten years ago almost no nation had
                        a population growth rate of three percent; now such rates are not uncommon
                        and there is no reasonable prospect that they can be significantly reduced
                        in the next decade, whatever means might be tried. These increases impede
                        capital formation in the areas where it is needed most, since increases in
                        production simply go to keep alive the larger numbers of unproductive old
                        people and children. In some cases total <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>
                        grows while per capita <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> falls. Standards
                        of living are declining in some countries at precisely the time when the
                        revolutionary leaders now in charge must begin to meet the expectations
                        which have arisen in their own and in their fellow countrymen's minds.</p>
                    <p>38. The problem of maintaining standards of living and even that of
                        satisfying to a degree rising economic expectations probably can be met with
                        substantial infusions of outside aid and with the execution of national
                        development programs. However, even if these countries received outside aid
                        in massive quantities, they would still confront the grave political and
                        social problems of backward and uprooted societies. Indeed, <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0050"/>these problems will inhibit both the receipt
                        and proper use of needed economic assistance. The present revolutionary
                        leaders must surmount this great complex of problems if they are to sustain
                        the nationalist character of their revolutions; if they fail, they may be
                        replaced by Communist leaders ready to use Draconian methods and determined
                        to impose permanent totalitarian institutions.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. International Outlook</p>
                    <p>39. If, as we suggest above, the emerging countries will be preoccupied with
                        their own problems, their attitudes toward the outside world will be
                        determined largely by the way in which they feel the outside world impinges
                        upon these problems. These countries and their leaders will not be concerned
                        so much with ideological, moral, and cultural considerations as they will
                        with manipulating outside influences in order to protect themselves or to
                        advance their particular interests. The two great powers are likely to be
                        viewed largely in terms of the threat or succor which they will afford.</p>
                    <p>40. Some of the emerging states have clearly aligned themselves with one or
                        another of the two great powers. Many of these are states on the periphery
                        of the Sino-Soviet Bloc—Iran, Pakistan Thailand, South Vietnam, and South
                        Korea—and their leaders have aligned themselves with the US in order to
                        obtain that military and economic assistance which they hoped would enable
                        them to keep any domestic enemies at bay and to stand up against pressures
                        from their powerful neighbors. Cuba alleges similar reasons for aligning
                        itself with the USSR.</p>
                    <p>41. In general, however, those who thought they could safely do so have
                        chosen neutralism, and indeed some of them have made quite a profitable
                        thing of it. In their desire to achieve and maintain national independence
                        they have sought to avoid commitment to either side, and they have
                        recognized the value to both sides of their not falling under the domination
                        of the other. This has permitted some of them successfully to seek economic
                        assistance from both and some others to seek assistance from one side by
                        suggesting that they might appeal to the other. Nevertheless, many of these
                        countries, in the course of their colonial or semicolonial history, have
                        been subjected to Western influences and institutions and have therefore
                        come to feel that “neutralism” requires a pronounced reaction away from
                        these influences and some closer relationship with the Sino-Soviet Bloc.</p>
                    <p>42. This trend has been accelerated by increased Soviet willingness to
                        compete with the West in providing economic assistance and diplomatic
                        support. Bloc economic assistance overall is still considerably less than
                        the US equivalent, but the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in
                        particular can substantially enlarge its program. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has some advantages over the US in
                        carrying out aid programs; it can move more quickly and without regard to a
                        variety of politically-imposed restrictions which characterize <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0051"/>US activities. On the other hand, as Soviet
                        aid becomes more commonplace and taken for granted, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is beginning to encounter some of the
                        criticisms and problems which the US has faced in its foreign aid
                        programs.</p>
                    <p>43. We believe that if the present trend toward neutralism is not reversed,
                        it will become so strong that it will draw away from the West some of those
                        nations now associated with it. This might come about through revolutions in
                        some of these countries—for example Iran or South Vietnam—with seizure of
                        power by nationalist-neutralist forces; it could occur because existing
                        regimes might decide to seek the supposed benefits and safety of neutrality;
                        it could come about because these nations might decide that the US was
                        becoming inferior to the Sino-Soviet Bloc in military power and therefore
                        would no longer be willing or able to support them.</p>
                    <p>44. The neutralist posture of these countries seems to us likely to produce
                        in the decade ahead some most serious policy problems for the US. Aside from
                        the probability of withdrawal from Western association and attempts to
                        balance Western with Soviet or Chinese influence, there will be continual
                        pressures for economic aid and political support, for denunciations of
                        colonialism, for concessions on disarmament, and for further Western retreat
                        from positions of predominance or influence. The US position in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will probably become increasingly difficult,
                        particularly since many of these countries—including such influential
                        members as India and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>—now appear to
                        believe that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> machinery has been used
                        by the major Western powers and especially by the US as an instrument of
                        national, and hence in their view “imperialist,” policy. For this reason,
                        the idea of revising the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> charter and
                        proposals to bring in Communist China have received widespread sympathy
                        among the emerging nations. Their numbers are now so great that when their
                        views become more crystallized—as now seems unavoidable—the hitherto
                        predominant Western influence in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will
                        be greatly reduced.</p>
                    <p>45. It is obvious that neutralism as a principle is fundamentally
                        incompatible with the Soviet objective of a Communist world. Nevertheless,
                        neutralism may often provide Communists with opportunities for penetration
                        and subversion. Particularly in the areas of the new states, the Communists
                        will seize upon rivalries among nations and tribes, upon the need for
                        economic and technical aid, and upon the naivete and weaknesses of
                        inexperienced leaders. Hence the problem for neutralist states is to keep
                        out of Communist clutches. Nevertheless, insofar as the new and
                        underdeveloped nations can overcome their problems, they may take on a
                        strength and stature which will enable them to maintain their neutrality
                        against Communist pressures.</p>

                    <p>At a meeting of senior foreign policy advisers on January 17, 1961, Secretary
                        of State Christian Herter asked his Special Assistant <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Charles Bohlen</persName> to explain Soviet intentions
                        in Laos in light of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s airlifting
                        of weapons and other supplies to rebels in Laos attempting to overthrow the
                        Royal Lao Government. According to a memorandum of the conversation,
                            <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> replied that the “Soviets
                        don't want to turn the Lao situation into a large operation. He [<persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>] agrees with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> that the Soviets are not seeking
                        a complete victory, but, at the same time, that they would not accept a
                        complete defeat.” Soviet involvement in Laos, <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> continued, was “also in part a function of the
                        Soviet-ChiCom row. Following the Communist meeting in Moscow last November,
                        the Soviets probably have to demonstrate their Bolshevik revolutionary
                        zeal.” For text of the memorandum of conversation, see <ref target="frus1961-63v24">

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> last week used propaganda charges
                        of US harassment of Soviet merchant vessels to convey the impression that
                        the new US administration is obligated to take unilateral measures to
                        improve Soviet-American relations. In a press conference in Moscow on 12
                        January, Minister of Merchant Marine Viktor Bakayev charged that US military
                        aircraft and ships were systematically conducting “provocative actions”
                        against Soviet vessels.</p>
                    <p>The main purpose of the press conference and a subsequent note to the US on
                        14 January<note n="2" xml:id="d8fn2">For text of the Soviet note of January
                            14, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, February 6,
                            1961, p. 178.</note> probably was to create an issue of a secondary
                        nature which the Soviet leaders may use to differentiate between the two US
                        administrations. Twice during his press conference Bakayev expressed hope
                        that the “new government” of the US would denounce the actions and put an
                        end to the “provocations of the American armed forces.” He said such a move
                        would make a “good contribution to the improvement of Soviet-American
                        relations.”</p>
                    <p>Bloc propaganda has also gone to some lengths on such other issues as Laos
                        and Cuba to make clear that its criticism of the US was directed at the
                        “outgoing <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> administration”
                        and to differentiate sharply between the present unsatisfactory state of
                        Soviet-American relations and Moscow's expectations of improved relations
                        under the new President.</p>
                    <p>The bloc has also used President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>'s State of the Union message<note n="3" xml:id="d8fn3">For text of the message, January 12, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States:

                                1960-61</hi>, pp. 913-930.</note> to emphasize that improvement of
                        Soviet-American relations will depend primarily on the attitude of the new
                        US administration. A <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> review described
                        the message as an attempt to “whitewash reality” and convince the new
                        President that the present “bankrupt policy” should be continued. <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> also claimed that while the speech evoked
                        no <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0054"/>interest, the inaugural address of
                        the new President was being “awaited with much interest.”</p>
                    <p>Other Soviet broadcasts asserted that the change in administrations will mean
                        a change in the atmosphere of Soviet-US relations, and that statements by
                        members of the new administration already “testify to their correct
                        understanding” of important international problems. The Hungarian news
                        service reported a press editorial which presumed that the new US
                        administration would end the “dead-lock” in Western policy and resume
                        East-West negotiations, “if not on the highest level at least under
                        conditions making possible the examination of the most important
                        international questions.”</p>
                    <p>Soviet spokesmen have privately continued to stress the need for top-level
                        talks on disarmament, a nuclear test ban agreement, and the Berlin and
                        German questions. The Soviet military attaché in Turkey, obviously under
                        instructions, sought out his US counterpart and stressed the importance of
                        an early meeting between the new President and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and a “rapid agreement” on disarmament.</p>

                            declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>Bloc diplomats have also apparently inspired press reports that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is prepared to withhold pressure
                        for immediate East-West negotiations provided the US indicates its
                        willingness eventually to discuss disarmament, a nuclear test ban, and the
                        German question. A <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> correspondent in
                        Geneva told a reliable American observer that there would be “no trouble” on
                        Berlin “for awhile,” but that eventually the question should be settled on
                        the basis of a free city. He implied, however, that the USSR would settle
                        for a more limited agreement involving public renunciation of support for
                        refugee and émigré organizations, which Moscow would represent as a step
                        toward American recognition and acceptance of the situation in Eastern
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>This line is similar to that taken by East German party chief <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> in a speech to his central
                        committee meeting last month in which he listed removal of “harassing
                        centers” and renunciation of “revanchist propaganda” as two conditions which
                        would assure a “peaceful solution.” These minimum demands, however, were
                        linked to some form of recognition of East Germany.</p>
                    <p>While a period of conciliatory gestures toward the US and restraint on Berlin
                        seems to be developing, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        has at the same time sought to maintain a certain sense of urgency over
                        Berlin. The re-emergence of the separate peace treaty threat in private
                        talks coincides with reports from bloc sources that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is committed to carry out this
                        threat if he fails to obtain his objectives through negotiations. In his 6
                        January speech<note n="4" xml:id="d8fn4">See <ref target="#d13fn1">footnote
                                1, Document 13</ref>.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> warned that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was fully determined to <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0055"/>sign a separate treaty with East Germany if
                        the Western powers refused to recognize the “real situation” in Berlin and
                        Germany. He gave no indication of an immediate action, but instead pledged
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> “to continue, step by step, to
                        bring aggressive-minded imperialists to their senses.”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> believes that
                        since the Soviet party congress—scheduled for October—follows so soon after
                        the German elections, it is unlikely that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will await the outcome of these elections before
                        forcing the issue of Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Thus, while <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> appears to have
                        disregarded his earlier deadline of April—mentioned to the West German
                        ambassador last fall—he has in effect implied a new deadline for East-West
                        negotiations before the West German elections this September; moreover, he
                        has made it clear that pressure on the West may be gradually applied if his
                        campaign for negotiations appears to be lagging.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> correspondent stressed that a
                        nuclear test ban was a more critical problem than Berlin. He hinted that
                        when negotiations resumed, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would
                        be prepared to reach a “reasonable agreement” on the issue of the number of
                        annual on-site inspections of areas where detection equipment indicated a
                        possible nuclear explosion. Thus far, the Soviet delegation at Geneva has
                        refused to negotiate the issue since proposing three inspections in the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> each year. The Soviets, however,
                        have hinted that their proposal is subject to amendments, but only if the
                        Western powers concede that the basis for determining the number of
                        inspections will be an arbitrary political decision rather than a scientific
                        estimate of the probable number of suspicious natural occurrences, such as
                        earthquakes.</p>
                    <p>Thus far Soviet propaganda has not commented on American press reports of the
                        special task force recommendation to the new President that nuclear test ban
                        talks and disarmament negotiations be deferred for several months.</p>
                    <p>Press reports of the full text of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s 6 January speech, on the results of the Moscow
                        conference of Communist leaders, indicate that it is intended as a
                        definitive Soviet interpretation of the doctrinal and policy questions
                        covered in the Moscow declaration of 6 December. Publication of the full
                        text of this speech was delayed until 17 January, in the party journal <hi rend="italic">Kommunist</hi>. Publication at this time is probably
                        intended to complement an expected Central Committee resolution on the

                    <p>1706. Eyes only Secretary. Following is aide-memoire handed me by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> today. Request this be closely
                        held pending receipt my explanatory message.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Begin text.</p>
                    <p>Soviet Government, guided by sincere desire to begin a new phase in relations
                        between Soviet Union and US, has decided to meet wishes of American side in
                        connection with release of two American airmen, members of crew of RB-47
                        reconnaissance airplane of US Air Force, F. Olmstead and D. McKone.</p>
                    <p>In considering this question Soviet Government took account above all of
                        statements by President of US J. Kennedy during period of election campaign,
                        which testify to fact that he did not and does not approve of reconnaissance
                        flights of American military aircraft over (V predely) Soviet Union. We
                        proceed from fact that new US Government, which is now led by Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, will act in practice in spirit of these
                        statements. With this there would be removed a serious obstacle to
                        improvement of Soviet-American relations.</p>
                    <p>Soviet Government also took into account wishes for freeing of two airmen of
                        RB-47 aircraft expressed lately to Soviet Ambassador in Washington by
                        prominent figures of Democratic Party from closest circles of Mr. J. Kennedy
                        who indicated that such a step of Soviet Government would be regarded by
                        American side as a gesture of good-will and a step toward improvement of
                        Soviet-American relations. Same opinion was expressed by US Ambassador in
                        Moscow, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Soviet Government hopes that this act of good-will will be correctly
                        interpreted and appraised in corresponding fashion by US Government and that
                        in future, actions of the kind leading to sharpening of relations between
                        our countries, which have formerly taken place, will not be permitted.</p>
                    <p>Soviet Government expects that US Government for its part will also devote
                        efforts to improvement of Soviet-American relations, and hopes that release
                        of American airmen will serve cause of strengthening trust between our
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>We should like to put an end to past and open a new page in relations between
                        our countries. With these objectives Soviet Government is prepared to go
                        further and not to insist on discussion at second part of 15th <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0057"/>Session of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        General Assembly on question “concerning aggressive actions of USA.” The
                        Soviet Government proceeds from view that, given correct understanding of
                        this step by US Government, favorable conditions for improvement of
                        Soviet-American relations will result. Let bad past not interfere with our
                        joint work in name of good future.</p>
                    <p>Soviet Government would like to hope that US Government for its part will
                        also do everything in order not to burden agenda of forthcoming second part
                        of 15th Session of General Assembly with discussion of questions which will
                        inevitably drag us to times of “cold war.”</p>
                    <p>It is possible that there will still be found those desirous of going on path
                        of further mutual reproaches in relations between <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and USA. But we do not consider that this would be a
                        correct and reasonable path. According to our deep conviction there are
                        every grounds for normalizing international situation and clearing away by
                        common efforts all rubbish and all residue (Nanosnogo) which has accumulated
                        during years of “cold war” in Soviet-American relations.</p>
                    <p>Soviet Government hopes that its effort to find common language and mutual
                        understanding with US Government will meet with positive response from
                        American side and personally from President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Improvement of relations between our countries will doubtless meet with warm
                        approval by peoples both of Soviet Union and US, and also by all other
                        peoples, since cause of strengthening universal peace and international
                        security in much depends on how relations between <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and USA develop.</p>

                        Soviets ready release fliers immediately, as soon as appropriate
                        notification received from US that we were in agreement with Soviet
                        position. He said it was still Soviet position that there was intrusion
                        Soviet territorial waters and it was a Soviet right shoot down plane and
                        Soviets would continue such action if further intrusions. If US agrees with
                        Soviet aide-memoire Soviets will release fliers. If not, only logical
                        outcome would be to organize a trial although Soviets recognize this would
                        only lead to further exacerbation situation.</p>
                    <p>I replied that I appreciate spirit in which proposal made but at pres-ent
                        moment old administration had gone and I as yet had no instructions from new
                        and therefore what I said would have to be on personal basis. Of course I
                        was prepared transmit proposal to Government but at risk seeming ungrateful
                        wanted point out certain considerations. As Chairman knew, our position is
                        that plane did not violate Soviet territory and we prepared submit case to
                        international arbitration in order solve difficult situation. However, this
                        did not change fact that we would like fliers back and I thought I could be
                        sure President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> also would
                        like forget past and make new start, and utilize opportunity change of
                        administration for this purpose. As I understood it however fliers would
                        only be released if we expressed agreement Soviet point of view. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> thought I had misunderstood and
                        had thought we were supposed to agree with Soviet version of incident. I
                        explained this not case but pointed out there were two problems involved in
                        his proposal. Judging from President's statements during campaign there
                        would appear to be little doubt about his intention not approve violations
                        Soviet frontiers by overflights. Aide-memoire however referred to dropping
                            <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> agenda items, and I assumed that
                        it meant on our side resolutions on <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0059"/>Hungary and Tibet. I said he should realize difficult position in which he
                        would put President if he insisted upon making bargain which involved these
                        fliers where we thought our position right and other matters. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> made clear each side was free to
                        maintain its point of view regarding incident and he simply asked that we
                        not attempt exploit release of fliers against them. He intimated that upon
                        their return they could be made to say things which would exacerbate
                        relations. I said we had once made clear we would not do this but pointed
                        out we had free press and there would doubtless be some publicity. With
                        regard question exploitation Khrushchev said this was reason aide-memoire
                        had referred to my conversation.<note n="3" xml:id="d10fn3">For a report on

                        wished point out their press also free and said if not how could they have
                        published such thing as article referring to eleven missing airmen.<note n="4" xml:id="d10fn4">
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is referring to an
                            article in Ogonek, January 15, 1961, which stated that 11 of the crew of
                            a U.S. C-130, shot down over Soviet Armenia on September 2, 1958, were
                            captured near Yerevan.</note> He grinned and said “you were not slow to
                        pounce on this” and added of course article nothing but carelessly written
                        novel. I pointed out that of course much time had passed since my
                        conversation to which he had referred. He acknowledged this but said frankly
                        they had not wished release these fliers to <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> administration for if they had <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> would have exploited it during
                        campaign. In order illustrate how I thought matter should be handled I told
                        him of suggestion I had submitted that President make statement about
                        overflights at his January 25 press conference and assume Soviets would
                        release fliers. With great glee he said he had taken action first. He then
                        went on to explain that there was no link between question of fliers and
                        dropping agenda items. He said offer to release fliers was not subject to
                        conditions and that aide-memoire would not be published. I said it was
                        necessary to be clear what was expected of US. Was I to understand that if
                        President either informed them or said publicly that he had no intention to
                        send planes across their frontier, fliers would be released? <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that if President were to
                        add to such statement regarding overflights that US wanted good relations
                        not only with Soviets but with all governments, this would be favorably
                        received by them.</p>
                    <p>I said that at time fliers were released this would be news and it would be
                        necessary to understand clearly what would be said to press. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> suggested we work out problem
                        with Soviet Foreign Minister in order that we both say same thing. Unclear
                        whether this would be joint statement or agreed position.</p>
                    <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0060"/>
                    <p>On agenda items he said they did not wish to start off Assembly discussions
                        by arguing cold war matters with <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>. They had their own cold war agenda items but such
                        discussion would spoil relations.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Recommend we reply accepting Soviet proposal
                        re fliers and state that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agenda items will
                        be subject further discussion. Somewhat difficult define precisely what
                        Soviet proposal is but I understand two factors involved. (1) We accept in
                        some form their interpretation new President's position re overflights; (2)
                        we give at least oral assurance to endeavor not exploit release of men
                        against them. Since President will probably have to take public position on
                        overflight policy, it might be handled at his press conference where
                        distinction between <gloss target="#t_U21">U-2</gloss> and RB-47 can be made
                        clear. Anticipate difficulty reaching agreed position with Foreign Office
                        although think they clearly understand that each side will maintain its

                        Aide-Memoire.</p>
                    <p>The United States Government is gratified by the decision of the Soviet
                        Government to release Captain Freeman B. Olmstead and Captain John R.
                        McKone, members of the crew of the United States Air Force RB-47 aircraft
                        who have been detained by the Soviet authorities since July 1, 1960. The
                        United States Government considers that this action of the Soviet Government
                        removes a serious obstacle to improvement of Soviet-American relations.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government is fully aware of the United States Government views
                        with respect to the distinction between the question of the United States
                        Air Force RB-47 and the incident which occurred over Soviet territory on May
                        1, 1960, involving an American <gloss target="#t_U21">U-2</gloss> type
                        aircraft. Flights of American aircraft penetrating the air space of the
                        Soviet Union have been suspended since May 1960 and President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> has ordered that they not be
                        resumed.</p>
                    <p>As respects the stated willingness of the Soviet Government not to insist on
                        discussion at the resumed Fifteenth Session of the United Nations General
                        Assembly of the Soviet inscribed item “concerning aggressive actions of the
                        USA,” it would not seem feasible to the United States Government to seek to
                        remove specific items already included on the General Assembly agenda.
                        However the United States Government believes that in so far as possible the
                        work of the United Nations should be approached in a constructive manner and
                        that restraint should be exercised in debating matters of difference between
                        member states. The United States Delegation to the resumed session will
                        approach its tasks in this spirit.</p>
                    <p>As was stated in the inaugural address of the President of the United States
                        and reiterated in his message to the Chairman of the Council of Ministers
                        and the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> of January 21, the United States
                        Government shares the hope expressed by the Soviet Government that progress
                        can be made toward improving the relationship between the two countries and
                        toward common efforts of both governments designed to assure a peaceful and
                        more fruitful life for all mankind. The United States Government, for its
                        part, will do everything within its power to promote these high
                        purposes.</p>
                    <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0063"/>
                    <p>While the United States Government will naturally wish to study carefully and
                        deliberately the broader international issues, it is prepared to proceed
                        without delay to practical first steps in the field of relations between the
                        United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. In this
                        connection, the United States suggests a prompt review through diplomatic

                        Government would also be pleased to proceed expeditiously to renewed
                        consideration of the proposal which has been previously discussed between
                        the two governments for the establishment of a United States Consulate

                    <p>G-504. During my conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> on January 21 he expressed sympathy for
                        difficulties I had faced in Moscow which he attributed to uneven policy U.S.
                        Government past eight years. After his expressing his usual opinions on
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and Dulles, I said I
                        had become convinced I had been a poor Ambassador as there was clearly <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0064"/>wide misunderstanding on both sides,
                        but particularly Soviet. I referred to his January 6 speech<note n="2" xml:id="d13fn2">For text of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s speech before a meeting of Communist Party
                            organizations, January 6, see <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>, January 24,
                            1961; extracts are also printed in <hi rend="italic">American Foreign

                            summary and analysis of the speech, see <ref target="#d15">Document
                                15</ref>.</note> and said I thought major part of difficulty was
                        that Soviets interpreted everything in terms of class struggle and saw the
                        world only through Marxist eyes. I said Soviets seemed to think we were
                        concerned about Communism as an economic system. This was not the case. Many
                        Americans thought of Soviet Union in terms of worst days of Stalin whereas
                        Soviets thought of the West as in the days of Marx. There have been changes
                        on both sides, but their margin of error was greater. What worried the West
                        was not economic and social organization, but concern that Soviet Union
                        itself desired to dominate the world with Communism as means to this end. We
                        believed every country should decide its own system and if they freely
                        decided on Socialism or Communism that was all right, but once a country
                        became a member of the Communist Bloc the whole power of the bloc was used
                        to keep it Communist regardless of the wishes of the people and I cited
                        Hungary. If this sort of thing went on, of course eventually the world would
                        become Communist.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said idea Soviets desire
                        to dominate world neither correct nor possible. He cited Soviet initiative
                        in changing designation of Soviet Union as leader of Communist bloc. There
                        was no leader and each party equal. I read quotation from his speech that
                        Soviet Union would do everything to maintain unity of Socialist bloc and
                        asked if everything included use of force. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said this passage referred solely to ideological
                        questions. He said Westerners were always talking about China, implying that
                        this could be exploited against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
                        While he said nothing further about China specifically, he said what he
                        really meant by stating that everything must be sacrificed for bloc unity
                        was that Communist countries must make mutual concessions in order to
                        preserve the strength of the bloc. At this point he launched into the
                        discussion reported mytel 1708.<note n="3" xml:id="d13fn3">See <ref target="#d10fn4">footnote 4, Document 10</ref>.</note> In discussing
                        the US role as “international gendarme,” he ridiculed US fear of Communist
                        agents implying that we looked for danger to ourselves in the wrong places.
                        As an example he cited Western charges that Lenin was a German agent. He
                        also mentioned Iran and said that Shah was not really afraid of a Soviet
                        attack, but of Iraq and its example to his own people.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> suggested consider disband
                        all blocs and they would pull their troops out of the countries of Eastern
                        Europe. I replied they would still have a monolithic system and I could not
                        believe the contrary until some country which had become Communist was
                        allowed to <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0065"/>change its system. I said
                        I believed the Soviet people in general supported the system here, but this
                        was not true of most other Communist countries. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> observed that Hitler had counted on the people
                        turning against the regime when he invaded the Soviet Union, but they had
                        been wrong. I said that there had been serious disaffection in the early
                        days and <hi rend="italic">Molotov</hi> himself had told us of his concern
                        about it, but Hitler had helped them out by insisting upon mistreating the
                        population and maintaining the Germans were the master race. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> responded that Hitler was a fool
                        and that if he had been wise he would not have been Hitler, but Stalin.</p>
                    <p>Referring to our earlier discussion, I said the Soviets misunderstood the
                        economic system of the United States and I described the workings of our
                        laws against monopolies and the functions of the regulatory agencies in the
                        United States. As an example of how this system works, I cited the case of
                        the International Business Machines Company which had been forced by the
                        Government to make a large number of its patents available to other
                        companies. I reminded him of his visit to one of this company's factories
                        near San Francisco.<note n="4" xml:id="d13fn4">For documentation on

                        of fact and urged that they have their people study how our system really
                        worked. I said it had its weaknesses, but it did not justify their
                        interpretation that everything could be explained by exploited and
                        exploited.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> referred to their action
                        in widening contacts with America and observed that the system was going
                        well, but said he thought trade should be developed and this in turn would
                        improve political relations. He said the State Department and his friend Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> who is now Secretary of
                        the Treasury, were opposed to this view. He said it was the U.S. which
                        suffered from this attitude and they were having good trade relations with
                        the companies in West Germany, the U.K., France, and others.</p>
                    <p>I said I had never understood why they had agreed to negotiate about a lend
                        lease settlement knowing that the position they were taking was unacceptable
                        to us. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> merely repeated the
                        usual Soviet arguments on this subject, but ended by saying perhaps we could
                        freeze this question and trade in the meantime. He also reported the
                        apparent misunderstanding which <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> had of his conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> when he asserted that <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> had said the United States would

                        Ambassador. I said I had no information other than press reports and
                        expected none for several days. He said with a smile they would gladly give
                        me their vote but he was not sure this would be helpful. I replied I also
                        had some doubts. I said if I did remain I assumed I would be returning to
                        Washington before long for consultation. Khrushchev asked me to give his
                        regards to the President, <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>,
                        and others whom he had met.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> seemed reasonably well but
                        there were some signs that he had felt the strain of the long debates in the
                        Central Committee Plenum.</p>

                        transmitted a memorandum to Secretary of State <hi rend="italic">Rusk</hi>
                        suggesting that he send a personal telegram to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> to inform him that the President
                        intended to call him back once the President and Secretary both had time to
                        devote for serious consultations. (Department of State, Central Files,
                        661.00/1- 2461) The following day <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                        sent the telegram stating that the recall would be both to get <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>'s advice and to demonstrate the

                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> Speech on Moscow Meeting
                        of World Communist Leaders</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s report on 6 January,
                        published in the Soviet party journal <hi rend="italic">Kommunist</hi> on 17
                        January, was intended to stand as the definitive Soviet interpretation of
                        last November's Moscow conference of world Communist leaders. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> vigorously reaffirmed his
                        party's position on the issues in dispute with Peiping and made it clear
                        that the conference did not alter the views of the Soviet leadership.</p>
                    <p>Probably timed to complement the short and formal 18 January Soviet central
                        committee resolution on the results of the conference, the speech took a
                        more forthright position in dealing with the major questions of doctrine and
                        policy than the often equivocal Moscow declaration of 6 December. The
                        handling of the various issues indicates continuing areas of disagreement
                        with Peiping and suggests that Moscow is determined to make no important
                        concessions to the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>In effect, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> defended the
                        validity of his foreign policy and reaffirmed that the only correct and
                        prudent course under conditions of a nuclear stalemate is a policy of
                        limited risks to achieve political gains. As he put it, “We always seek to
                        direct the development of events in a way which ensures that, while
                        defending the interests of the socialist camp, we do not provide the
                        imperialist provocateurs with a chance to unleash a new world war.”</p>
                    <p>Exuding confidence that the trend of international events continues to run in
                        favor of the socialist camp, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> stressed that the general strategic line and
                        tactics of world Communism depend on correct evaluation of character of the
                        balance of power. While reiterating the standard proposition that the bloc
                        is the “decisive factor” in world affairs, he warned that imperialism
                        retains “great strength”; under these circumstances, he implied, the bloc
                        cannot undertake the extremely militant, revolutionary program advocated by
                        Peiping. As <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> put it, “To
                        win time in the economic contest with capitalism is now the main thing.”</p>
                    <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0068"/>
                    <p>Against this backdrop, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> went
                        beyond the Moscow declaration in discussing policy toward the West. He
                        stated, “Our party considers the policy of peaceful coexistence, which has
                        been handed down to us by Lenin, to be the general line of our foreign
                        policy.” This statement takes on added significance in light of East German
                        party leader <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s acknowledgment
                        that the term “general line” provoked a dispute at the Moscow
                        conference.</p>
                    <p>The term did not appear in the final declaration, and <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> indicated that the Soviet party had
                        attempted to extract recognition from Peiping of such a bloc-wide “line” and
                        acceptance of the discipline it would impose on Chinese policies. Thus, in
                        effect, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> made it clear that
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s basic foreign policy would not
                        be adjusted to accommodate the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> also went further than the
                        declaration in restating Moscow's intention to engage the West in further
                        high-level talks. Unlike the declaration, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> reiterated his previous judgment that some
                        elements in the West understand the danger of war and accept the need for
                        coexistence. Building on this premise, he extended the Moscow statement by
                        reaffirming that “socialist states” strive for “negotiations and agreement”
                        with capitalist countries, and seek to “develop contacts” with capitalist
                        statesmen. Presidium member Suslov, who delivered the formal report on the
                        conference to the Soviet central committee plenum on 18 January, elaborated
                        on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s remark and
                        specifically pointed out that these contacts should be between heads of
                        states and governments.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> supported the correctness
                        of his approach by going into some detail on the consequences of modern war.
                        After discussing the hundreds of millions who would perish in such a war, he
                        called for a “sober appraisal” of the consequences as a necessary element in
                        mobilizing the struggle to prevent war.</p>
                    <p>He also reaffirmed that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is
                        ordinarily opposed to local wars because of the danger that they might
                        expand—a risk Peiping minimizes. As for one category of local wars, however,
                        i.e., “liberation” wars such as the Algerian rebellion—<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> stated his view, in apparent
                        agreement with Peiping, that such wars are indeed inevitable as long as
                        imperialism exists. He pledged that the bloc will give aid to such
                        “liberation” forces.</p>
                    <p>The speech reinforced earlier indications that Moscow will pursue a more
                        aggressive program in all “colonial” areas—among which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> specifies Algeria, the Congo,
                        and Laos. However, the speech evaded the question—on which the Chinese have
                        charged <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> with timidity—of
                        whether bloc support to “liberation” forces will go so far as to risk
                        military clashes with the West. Similarly, in distinguishing a fourth
                        category of wars—“national uprisings” such as Castro's—and in <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0069"/>stating his expectation of and favor for
                        such uprisings, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> declared
                        that such wars must not become wars between states, but he evaded the
                        question of what risks the bloc will take. He was particularly careful not
                        to categorize the Laotian situation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> defended at length his
                        policy of wooing the nationalist leaders of underdeveloped countries, even
                        at the cost of sacrificing the local Communist parties there. The Chinese
                        have accused him of exaggerating the importance of the neutralists (e.g.,
                        Nehru, Nasir, Sukarno), and have urged less Soviet aid and more of an effort
                        to bring these leaders down. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> seems willing to move a little faster toward
                        making pro-Soviet “national democracies” (e.g., Cuba) of the neutral
                        nations, but still not as fast as Peiping wishes.</p>
                    <p>As for the tactics of Communist parties in the West, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> reaffirmed a gradualist program
                        for these parties, envisaging lengthy preparation—through “democratic”
                        movements—for eventual revolution. The Chinese have argued that
                        “revolutionary situations” exist today in Western Europe and should be
                        exploited.</p>
                    <p>In the latter part of his speech, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> discussed the question of the discipline of the
                        world Communist movement, the underlying issue in the Sino-Soviet dispute.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> insisted that the
                        “unity” of the movement is of “foremost importance,” and he reiterated that
                        the Soviet party recognizes the “equality” of other parties and does not
                        regard itself as the “center” of the movement.</p>
                    <p>He followed this, however, by making clear that the Soviet party does indeed
                        wish to be regarded as the principal party and as the spokesman for the
                        bloc, and in effect he advised the other parties to get rid of those who
                        sympathize more with Peiping than with Moscow. Several parties at the
                        November conference had supported the Chinese on some issues, and many other
                        parties were neutral or split.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, in conclusion, addressed
                        himself directly to the Chinese, whom he condemned elsewhere in the speech,
                        without naming them, for persistent “dogmatism and sectarianism.” He
                        reminded them that Sino-Soviet “unity” is necessary to “disappoint” and
                        confound common enemies. Here and elsewhere he indirectly admitted that the
                        Moscow conference did not resolve Sino-Soviet differences and may actually
                        have made them worse.</p>
                    <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> quoted liberally
                        from the Moscow declaration as testimony to the extent of agreement reached,
                        the US Embassy has received reports that the original version of the speech
                        contained sharp criticism of the Chinese. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is reported to have bitterly castigated the
                        Chinese leaders and stated that although they were “stupid,” it was
                        necessary to reach agreement with them.</p>
                    <p>He also reportedly presented a full review of the sharp debates between the
                        Soviet representatives and the Chinese. He is said to have read <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0070"/>to the meeting of party functionaries in the
                        Kremlin the main parts of Liu Shao Chi's attack on Soviet policy as well as
                        his own reply and concluded with the statement, “This is what happened—you
                        can judge for yourselves.”</p>

                    <p>Despite <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s clear-cut victory
                        over a potent combination of enemies in 1957, when he carried out a sharp
                        reorganization of the Soviet Union's top political command, there have been
                        persistent doubts about the essential strength of his authority. During the
                        past year in particular, there was widespread speculation—touched off by a
                        number of developments in Soviet domestic and external policy—that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s power had been weakened or had
                        at least become subject to a collective “restraint” imposed by other
                        leaders. Even exponents of the belief that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has taken firm title to first place in the Soviet
                        hierarchy concede, in the words of one of them, that his authority “is not
                        yet independent of continuous, ever-renewed successes.”</p>
                    <p>Certainly, 1960 was not a year of unqualified success for Soviet foreign and
                        domestic policy or of unbroken calm in Kremlin politics. The juggling of the
                        Kremlin hierarchy and the summit collapse last spring, the stresses in
                        Sino-Soviet relations, the Soviet premier's tumultuous behavior at the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly, and the ailments of
                        Soviet agriculture may well have provided the material for political
                        controversy within the ruling command. Nevertheless, the sum of the evidence
                        indicates that the question of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s ultimate authority is not now at issue within
                        the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        Cult</p>
                    <p>One element in this evidence is the public image of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> as the uniquely gifted and
                        natural leader—an image persistently developed by his subordinates at all
                        levels and by the hacks of Soviet propaganda. The prestige conferred on
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is in part an
                        outgrowth of the totalitarian mechanism itself, which inexorably funnels
                        authority to a single point. This imbedded tendency, with its roots in the
                        Russian past, has probably been consciously abetted as a means of furthering
                        the Soviet Union's drive to expand its authority on the international scene
                        and its competition with the Chinese Communists.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, even in the face of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s expressed disapproval of adulation of
                        leaders—possibly genuinely intended—there is probably an irresistible urge
                        on the part of subordinates to ensure themselves a place on the leader's
                        bandwagon.</p>
                    <p>The end product, a new version of the leader cult replacing the discarded
                        Stalin cult, must not only reflect to a fair degree the actualities of <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0071"/>Kremlin politics but also have become
                        by now a political factor in itself. The overwhelming impression that
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is the focal point of
                        the Soviet state and singularly endowed to prosecute its aims is not likely
                        to encourage attempts to limit his authority or to increase his tolerance of
                        political obstacles.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Shape of the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> Image</p>
                    <p>The central committee session just completed provided a new, vivid
                        demonstration for the Soviet audience of the breadth of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s authority. The meeting opened
                        with the announcement that a party congress, nominally the Soviet Union's
                        highest tribune, had been called for next October and that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would present two major reports
                        there, thus guaranteeing not only that he will be the dominant figure at the
                        meeting itself but also that his name will be prominently featured in the
                        massive pre-congress build-up.</p>
                    <p>Published reports of the proceedings at the central committee plenum were
                        themselves a considerable addition to the leader image. They pictured
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> denouncing with almost
                        Jovian ire the managerial sins of top party figures, brushing aside their
                        excuses but accepting their fawning compliments, and repeatedly interrupting
                        speakers to give his own detailed prescriptions for agricultural ills. All
                        of this earned Pravda's praise as a model of the “Leninist approach” but
                        scarcely conveyed a picture of “collective leadership” to the Soviet
                        public.</p>
                    <p>Despite occasional semantic variations in the propaganda formulas applied to
                        the Soviet hierarchy and reiteration of the “collective leadership” theme,
                        the vast majority of party and government officials as well as ordinary
                        Soviet citizens cannot but be heavily influenced by the cumulative impact of
                        the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> cult. They are exposed
                        to a steady daily dosage comprised of the deference paid him publicly by his
                        lieutenants, the precedence given him on public occasions, the attention
                        devoted to him by Soviet communications media, and by the kinds of
                        ritualistic formulas by which he is conventionally described.</p>
                    <p>It is difficult to find a speech by an important figure in the regime without
                        sycophantic passages or an editorial in the central press which does not
                        cite <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> as authority for one
                        or another aspect of Soviet policy. On days when such organs as <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi> do not
                        feature the text of a <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        speech, their front pages are weighted down with pictures of the leader at
                        some public function and, more and more, with the texts of mutual exchanges
                        of praise between him and Soviet organizations or individuals who have
                        distinguished themselves in some area of production.</p>
                    <p>The general outlines of this cult present <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to the Soviet public in several aspects: as a
                        pre-eminent international statesman whose grasp of the common man's
                        aspirations is either admired or feared by other world leaders, as the true
                        spiritual successor of the revered <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0072"/>Lenin, and as the dynamic but flexible architect of party and government
                        policy. Presidium member Dmitry Polyansky attempted to span this whole
                        spectrum at the recent central committee meeting:</p>
                    <p>In the successes of the international Communist movement we must note the
                        leading role of the Leninist central committee of our party, headed by the
                        outstanding fighter for peace, democracy, and socialism—<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev</persName>. (Stormy
                        applause) He has won the respect of working people all over the world by his
                        profound knowledge of life, his bold and keen posing of problems, his
                        ability to orient himself quickly and correctly under difficult
                        circumstances, his wisdom, and his presence of mind.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Outstanding World Figure</p>
                    <p>The Soviet premier's numerous foreign excursions may not have been unmixed
                        successes and their results have probably been discussed and assessed
                        soberly in the Kremlin's inner councils, but the Soviet propaganda mill has
                        concealed any misgivings and has invariably pictured them as resounding
                        personal triumphs for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and
                        his policy of “peaceful coexistence.” Only one speech by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in the previous four and
                        one-half years was given greater treatment by Radio Moscow than the one he
                        made following his return to Moscow from the summit failure. The US Embassy
                        in Moscow reported for the same period an “extremely high volume of Soviet
                        materials quoting, praising, or otherwise calling positive attention to

                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s excursion into the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> last fall was accompanied by an
                        unprecedented outpouring of propaganda support. Before, during, and after
                        the General Assembly session, Soviet media were inundated with reports of
                        nationwide meetings which invariably expressed enthusiasm for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s conduct, with the texts of his
                        speeches at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and with <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> dispatches picturing <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s dominance of the proceedings
                        and the favorable worldwide “echo.”</p>
                    <p>This episode in Soviet diplomacy has, in the aftermath, been unremittingly
                        described, in typical examples, as a further demonstration of “the
                        impassioned and seething activity of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">N.S.
                            KHRUSHCHEV</persName>,” of “the indefatigable herald of peace, the true
                        Leninist, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">N.S. KHRUSHCHEV</persName>,” and, more
                        broadly, as proof of “the consistent peaceful policy of the Soviet
                        Government and the purposeful and tireless activity of the outstanding
                        champion of peace and friendship between nations, Comrade <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev</persName>.”</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">On the Home Front</p>
                    <p>Although he may feel and act as though the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s world position is his primary concern, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has at the same time given away
                        no part of his claim to a special grasp of domestic problems. At the January
                        central committee plenum he played to the limit the role of the stern,
                        broadly informed overseer of agricultural affairs, and the Soviet
                        image-makers <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0073"/>have labored constantly
                        to portray him as a leader of wide-ranging interests and knowledge, both
                        profound and imaginative, but still humble and solicitous for the public
                        welfare. The phrases “as <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">N.S.
                            KHRUSHCHEV</persName> has said” and “on the initiative of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">N.S. KHRUSHCHEV</persName>” are staples of Soviet
                        propaganda and appear in contexts of all kinds.</p>
                    <p>The first party conference held in the newly organized virgin lands
                        administrative territory, for example, dispatched a message of greetings to
                            “<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev</persName>,
                        the initiator of virgin lands reclamation who daily displays solicitude for
                        the development of the Kazakh virgin land.”</p>
                    <p>Such tributes to Khrushchev for his part in the virgin lands and
                        corn-planting programs, with which he is closely identified, are
                        commonplace, but the gamut is much wider. Among other things, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> can take credit, according to
                        presidium candidate member Korotchenko, for exercising “an enormous,
                        beneficial influence” on Soviet literature and, according to the chairman of
                        the State Planning Committee, for “indefatigable attention to a fuller
                        satisfaction of the growing demand of the population for consumer goods.”
                        Podgorny, a member of the presidium and head of the Ukrainian party, carried
                        the matter close to its most absurd level at the opening of the Kiev subway
                        last November:</p>
                    <p>The inhabitants of Kiev know very well that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev</persName> was the initiator of the
                        construction of the Kiev subway, and as its construction proceeded, we
                        always felt his attention and the assistance of the <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> central committee and the Soviet Government.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Leninist Leadership</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s carefully constructed
                        association with the image of Lenin has become imbedded in the formulas of
                        Soviet propaganda. References to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> as “the faithful Leninist” or as “head of the
                        Leninist central committee” are standard. Placing the Lenin hagiology at the
                        service of the present leadership, Soviet propaganda incessantly reiterates
                        that this leadership exemplifies a genuinely “Leninist style,” that the
                        “Leninist norms of party life” and “collective leadership,” ignored by
                        Stalin, have been restored, and that the party has overcome the “cult of the
                        leader, alien to Lenin.”</p>
                    <p>The commemoration of Lenin's 90th anniversary in 1960 produced a flood of
                        literature describing both his accomplishments and his personal
                        excellence—his modesty, distaste for sycophancy, and respect for the
                        opinions of others. The adulation heaped on Lenin had, of course, the effect
                        of increasing what he allegedly most detested, the “cult of the leader,” and
                        of strengthening, by association, the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> cult.</p>
                    <p>Soviet propagandists seem to feel no embarrassment in affirming the existence
                        of “collective leadership” at the very moment when their output is
                        increasingly focused on one man, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, nor in setting criticism of the leader cult side
                        by side with phrases such as “the central <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0074"/>committee headed by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">N.S.
                            KHRUSHCHEV</persName>,” “the Presidium headed by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">N.S. KHRUSHCHEV</persName>,” or “the central
                        committee, the Council of Ministers, and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">N.S.
                            KHRUSHCHEV</persName> personally.”</p>
                    <p>If, however, any of the party faithful should detect a contradiction, they
                        can refer to the “dialectical” reconciliation provided by the authoritative
                        text Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism. The masses are the levers of history,
                        this document declares, and “the cult of personality contradicts
                        Marxism-Leninsm.” At the same time, it is pointed out, “the overwhelming
                        majority of the masses of the workers are well aware that the authority and
                        popularity of the outstanding leaders of the working class have nothing in
                        common with the personality cult … . Without leaders who enjoy authority and
                        who are linked up with the masses and are popular among them, there is no
                        organized socialist movement … . The first-rate leaders of the working
                        class, who are intimately linked with the people and who successfully
                        conduct the struggle of the workers for their vital interests and ideals,
                        play an outstanding role in history and deserve the people's love.”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> no doubt considers that

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion</p>
                    <p>For the past two years, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>,
                        evidently considering the domestic front relatively secure, has been deeply
                        immersed in pressing the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
                        international ambitions. Atop an underlying movement of social and
                        ideological change, whose long-term political effects are probably only
                        vaguely sensed in the Kremlin as elsewhere, the regime's internal actions
                        have remained centered mainly on pragmatic, economic objectives.</p>
                    <p>The failure of Soviet agriculture to measure up to expectations appears to
                        have forced <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> once again to
                        concern himself directly with an area of policy which was once his major
                        interest. In the interim, however, his involvement in foreign affairs and
                        lengthy periods of rest, dictated by the state of his health, have
                        necessarily given many of the other members of the party presidium a good

                        affairs at home.</p>
                    <p>With the question of the succession always in the background, these
                        circumstances have created the ground for conflicts of ambition within the
                        hierarchy and for more or less sudden shifts in the fortunes of key figures.
                        Moreover there is still within the presidium, according to the best
                        available information, some room for “give and take” on important issues and
                        therefore an area in which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        is, to a degree, subject to influence and restraint. However, the shape of
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s present public
                        image, while only part of the evidence, provides some measure of his
                        position and suggests that his authority is neither threatened nor
                        diminished.</p>

                    <p>1784. There would be many advantages in informal meeting between President
                        and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> before President in
                        position where he could be expected to take definite positions on
                        controversial issues. Principal one would be to enable President to convince
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> of his intention not
                        to seek solutions by force and of his willingness undertake serious
                        negotiations. I believe Soviet policy was for a time influenced by
                        conviction <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> gained from his
                        meeting with <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> that latter
                        man of peace. Probably only specific result such meeting would be agreement
                        upon which issue we would tackle first, which I assume would be atomic
                        testing.</p>
                    <p>On other hand it would be difficult and perhaps unwise to hold such meeting
                        until President has had at least preliminary contact with our Western
                        allies. Moreover, if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> came
                        merely to continuation of assembly he would for his own reasons probably
                        feel obliged to take part in discussion of current issues and although he
                        might keep his shoes on, such intervention could scarcely be helpful.
                        Particularly difficult would be such questions as Laos and Congo. I suspect
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> realizes this and will
                        not take initiative although position might be different if there were
                        special session on disarmament alone.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRW1">Tubby</persName> suggested that consideration
                        should be given to the tone of the line being used at present in <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts to the Soviet Union. It <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0077"/>might be that this line should be
                        modified down somewhat. Mr. Washburn <note n="2" xml:id="d18fn2"> Abbot M.
                            Washburn, Deputy Director of the United States Information

                        factual and does not seem to bother the Soviets. In fact, jamming is easing
                        in some degree.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary thought we should review the situation with regard to Soviet-US
                        relations. We have our fliers back and we have announced that no more
                        overflights are to take place. Otherwise, there is no real change in the
                        situation. We should not encourage the thinking that a new dawn is rising in
                        relations with the Soviet Union. The Secretary doubted that we should make
                        any change in our information line toward the Soviet Union although he
                        agreed that serious thought should be given to the problem.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> to look
                        into this subject to see whether any modification in our line is
                        desirable.</p>

                    <p>1797. Eyes only Secretary. In non-political fields this Embassy chiefly
                        supplier raw materials and not staffed to attempt finished intelligence
                        estimates. Nevertheless I am becoming increasingly convinced we are grossly
                        over estimating Soviet military strength relative to ours.</p>
                    <p>I of course am not privy to all our intelligence on this subject though I do
                        see much of end product. It seems to me this over estimate has resulted from
                        natural tendency our military to assess enemy's capabilities at maximum as
                        may be only prudent from this point of view. Other factors <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0078"/>have been US service competition for funds,
                        our under estimation their capabilities in past, Soviet forceful
                        exploitation of their achievements in atomic, missile and space
                        technology.</p>
                    <p>I shall not attempt go into evidence that leads to my conclusion but hope
                        have opportunity discuss this upon my return Washington. It clearly not my
                        province attempt estimate our military needs and I am in any event convinced
                        we must maintain strong military posture along with attempt reach practical
                        measures reduce or eliminate armaments. From political point of view would
                        hope we would concentrate on second-strike capability and make clear doing
                        so.</p>
                    <p>Wish point out however our estimate Soviet military capabilities also affects
                        our (1) estimate their intentions in political field, (2) formulation our
                        own policies to meet our estimate of their capabilities and intentions and
                        (3) our estimate their reactions our policies and actions.</p>
                    <p>Among other things I think re (1) that because of emphasis on danger in
                        military field we have tended underestimate seriousness of threat in
                        political. Re (2) I think we sometimes react in military way to Soviet
                        political actions which in turn helps them achieve political objectives. Re
                        (3) if Soviets as relatively weak militarily as I suspect, their reaction to
                            SAMOS,<note n="2" xml:id="d19fn2">Satellite and Missile Observation
                            System.</note> attitude toward inspection, etc. would be quite different
                        than if they are as strong as we give them credit for. (While I am convinced
                        we should proceed with SAMOS I believe its use will require careful
                        preparation and handling).</p>
                    <p>It may be that we need two estimates of Soviet military capabilities, one for
                        purely military use in determining our own defense needs, and other as basis
                        for policy determinations, particularly in political field, in which case we
                        could be more realistic and not allow such wide margins for security
                        reasons.</p>

                    <p>1813. As new administration will apparently have to move rapidly in
                        determining our basic policy toward Soviet Union, I have attempted select,
                        with no pretense at originality, number of considerations which seem to me
                        worthy of emphasis this connection. Principal question I suppose is whether
                        we should attempt to reach accommodation with Soviet Union and resolve
                        principal issues by negotiation in serious manner; meaning being prepared
                        take risks in order reach agreements. While I gather from President's and
                        other statements that decision in affirmative has already been made, I think
                        we should be under no illusions as to what can be accomplished within
                        reasonable period time. I am on balance strongly in favor of making effort
                        although there are substantial arguments against it. In brief, any other
                        course would in my opinion cause further disunity in West, would greatly
                        diminish our chances of influencing or winning newly-emerging and neutral
                        countries, and would probably eventually end in war.</p>
                    <p>Soviet people ardently desire peace and friendship with US, in which they see
                        best hope of peace and better life for themselves. Soviet Union is, however,
                        in control of small group Communist leaders and likely remain so for long
                        period time. It is on this leadership that I feel most qualified to speak as
                        I have probably had more contact with these men than any non-Communist, but
                        it is also here that I find most difficulty in reaching my own conclusions.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is dominant
                        personality but quite possible he could disappear from scene within next few
                        years from natural or other causes, state health and methods operation. Fact
                        which I believe we must constantly remind ourselves is that these men
                        believing Communists. While true they are men who have ruthlessly fought way
                        to power, they have almost religious faith in their beliefs and this
                        motivates them to larger extent than generally believed. It is, of course,
                        true that no Communist regime will consider itself entirely safe as long as
                        there are powerful democratic, capitalist countries existing in world. It
                        also true, however, that these men are nationalists and there is constant
                        inner struggle between nationalism and their belief in Communism. This is
                        part of their continuing difficulty with Chinese Communists. Their
                        experience with Chinese Communists has made them realize, I suspect, that
                        even all-Communist world would leave them beset with enormous problems, but
                        I repeat they believers and will <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0080"/>go
                        on working toward goal of world Communism for long time to come. To fail do
                        so would be to deny faith which justifies their position of leadership, but
                        degree of effort and methods used are factors which our own policies can
                        influence. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> probably most
                        pragmatic and least dogmatic of all, but he basically as devout believer as
                        any. He is reported once to have said something to effect that if Communism
                        did not demonstrate its superiority and prevail throughout world, his life
                        would have lost its meaning. Difficulty in appraising such men well
                        expressed by Yugoslav Dedijer in article in London Times when he said “in
                        every Communist leader there are different psychological layers which
                        contradict each other: Original revolutionary idealism, bureaucratic
                        attitudes developed over long Stalin phase Communist development, and
                        finally pragmatism derived from today's realities. These elements
                        intermingled, and often reactions to particular points depend on which layer
                        has been reached.” When <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        speaks as chief of state of his desire for peaceful solutions, he quite
                        sincere and therefore effective. (He is liked and admired by nearly all my
                        diplomatic colleagues.) At same time he has in his speech of January 6
                        frankly and bluntly expressed his Communist beliefs and policies. Most
                        discouraging aspect of East-West negotiations is that we both look at same
                        set facts and see different things and this complicates arriving at
                        solutions. From their visits to US, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and some other leaders know that US is not ogre
                        that their propaganda paints, and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has frequently said to me that he realized it
                        would take long time for US to come to Communism. Leadership convinced,
                        however, that there are circles (military, Wall Street, monopolists) which
                        are terrified by Communism as economic and social system and are disputing
                        with forces for good in US. As they look around world they can find plenty
                        of evidence which they can use to justify to themselves their belief in
                        class struggle. They pose everything in these terms and do not accept that
                        our support of rightist or reactionary governments motivated by our fear
                        their attempt obtain world domination for power reasons, and instead see it
                        in terms of exploiters banding together to maintain exploited in
                        subservience.</p>
                    <p>Most hopeful aspect is that evolution which has taken place in Soviet Union
                        is proceeding rapidly. With abolition mass terror an element of democracy
                        has entered both party and country as whole. Soviet people have little
                        interest in international goals Communism, and tend be pro-American.</p>
                    <p>Their view of US and rest free world distorted through years of isolation and
                        intense propaganda, and they in general have come to accept Soviet system,
                        although they would like change and improve it. Nevertheless they exert
                        constant pressure toward accommodation with us. <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0081"/>Year ago in my despatch 412<note n="2" xml:id="d20fn2">Dated January 29, 1960. (Department of State, Central Files,
                            761.00/1-2960)</note> I attempted describe some current strains within
                        Soviet system and I would today make little change in views there expressed
                        although others would be added. I see enormous problems ahead for Soviet
                        leadership, but not such as should lead us to expect any breakdown in
                        system.</p>
                    <p>I am convinced that key to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s policy, which I believe supported by bulk
                        leadership, is that he believes if he can gain period of reduction tension
                        and hopefully some diversion resources from armaments to productive purposes
                        and possibly even aid in form credits and technology from West, he can lead
                        Soviet Union into era Communism and, by way of example, set most of rest of
                        world on path toward this goal. I am impressed by constant emphasis which
                        all Soviet leaders with whom I talk put on desirability trade (and I am sure
                        they have in mind credits and technological aid) with US. Whether or not
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> actually said to Nehru
                        that if he could have five years peaceful coexistence he could blow us over,
                        remark is as Italians say “bentrovato.”</p>
                    <p>Declaration Communist parties in Moscow, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s January 6 speech and Suslov's report to <gloss target="#t_CC1">CC</gloss> were surprisingly frank in showing that apart
                        from concern over possibility of war, Communists look upon their approach to
                        West as temporary expedient. Given situation in which Soviet party found
                        itself in relation to Eisenhower administration at time Moscow meeting of
                            <gloss target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss>'s it had little alternative to
                        compromise with Chinese Communist position since it could not at that time
                        demonstrate that there was any real possibility accommodation with West.
                        Extent to which Soviet party will be prepared modify program outlined,
                        should détente with West become fact, is something which only time can
                        demonstrate.</p>
                    <p>I am sure we would err if we should treat Communist threat at this time as
                        being primarily of military nature. I believe Soviet leadership has long ago
                        correctly appraised meaning atomic military power. They recognized major war
                        no longer acceptable means achieving their objective. We shall, of course,
                        have to keep our powder dry and have plenty of it, for obvious reasons.</p>
                    <p>Although non-military, Communist threat nonetheless lethal as it stands
                        today, and we shall be obliged devise better methods meet it or we will
                        surely lose. Communists look at everything in terms of victory and defeat
                        and probably realize that if Communist movement loses its dynamism it would
                        risk breaking up. Unfortunately Chinese Communists have considerably
                        rejuvenated revolutionary posture of Soviet party. Moreover, disunity of
                        West and our failure meet challenge presented by newly emerging countries as
                        well as our failure deal adequately with problems of Latin America, have
                        presented tempting prospects even to <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0082"/>more mellowed Soviet Communists. On the other hand, even Soviet Communists
                        have strong strain of nationalism and if he can offer hope of period
                        tranquillity I would not exclude eventual complete break between Soviet and
                        Chinese Communists. Great question is whether strains within Communist bloc
                        and more importantly evolution of Soviet system will develop quickly enough
                        to counterbalance added economic power which successful completion their
                        7-year plan will give them. Soviets are estimating they will over-fulfill
                        plan by equivalent of $100 billion. While doubtless exaggeration and while
                        much of any excess will have to be diverted to dealing with problem
                        agriculture and to satisfy growing demands their people, even one-fourth
                        this amount if used, for example, for foreign aid programs, subversion,
                        propaganda, etc., evoke awesome possibilities.</p>
                    <p>This will be followed by separate telegrams on some specific foreign policy
                        questions.</p>

                    <p>The Ambassador opened the conversation by extending congratulations to the
                        Secretary and expressing the hope that with the installation <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0083"/>of the new Administration the American
                        Government and people could now find the means of improving relations
                        between the two countries—the first steps taken by the new Administration
                        give the Soviets and all other peoples hope that there can be concerted
                        action between the two countries.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he looked forward to working with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> toward improvement of relations,
                        a matter of enormous mutual interest. He suggested it would be valuable to
                        find means of progress on lesser but tangible questions thus providing a
                        proper framework for consideration of more difficult questions. For example,
                        there are the questions of an air transport agreement, establishment of
                        consulates at Leningrad and New York, and expansion of the exchange program.
                        While these are not the most important questions they can build a basis for
                        mutual understanding and also assist in developing public understanding. The
                        Secretary said he wanted to comment on the timing of the nuclear test ban
                        negotiations—the date suggested by the United States does not constitute
                        delay but rather the minimum time for a new Administration to review and
                        prepare. He asked if the Ambassador had any knowledge of the Soviet
                        Government's reaction to the suggested date of March 21.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said he had no word, noting that the United States approach
                        had been made by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>. He said he would remind his Government that a reply is
                        expected.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> is returning from Moscow on consultation, and
                        suggested that he might bring the Soviet Government's answer with him. The
                        Secretary said Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>
                        is not returning with a collection of problems acquired in Moscow but rather
                        to consult with the new Administration in order to go back better prepared
                        for discussion on a whole range of questions. The Secretary expressed his
                        and the President's utmost confidence in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> said that the
                        Secretary had not mentioned in his early remarks normalization of trade,
                        which was one thing that the Ambassador thought would help greatly, not so
                        much from the economic standpoint as from the standpoint of creation of a
                        better climate. The Secretary said that the items he mentioned, i.e., air
                        transport and consequent increased travel, would be a part of normalization
                        of trade and referred to the fact that there are many more American tourists
                        in the Soviet Union than Soviet tourists in the United States. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> said the Soviets buy
                        more U.S. goods. He said that it is not Soviet policy to earn dollars—rather
                        they are glad to spend these dollars in the United States. Soviet tourism in
                        the U.S., he said, is increasing and there have been 1,000 this year. The
                        Secretary mentioned the admiration of a colleague of his of the roadside
                        tourist camps he encountered on a drive <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0084"/>from Leningrad to the Crimea. The Ambassador said that the
                        President of Intourist had recently said that Soviet capacity to handle
                        tourists would be increased by 1965 by 200,000 per year. He then reverted to
                        the question of trade normalization and problems created by U.S.
                        restrictions. He noted that the U.S. was the only big country with which the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> does not have a trade agreement
                        with most favored nation provisions. Most favored nation treatment, he said,
                        is a sign of normalcy. The Secretary mentioned that a major element
                        restricting trade can be the patent and copyright situation in countries
                        with different policies. The Ambassador said that commercial contracts can
                        take care of this situation, noting his own trade experience for many years
                        with the Soviet Government. He said that the present trade level of 40-50
                        million dollars between the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is only about a tenth of what it was in 1930. He said the
                        Soviet Government does not wish to purchase military or strategic
                        items—indeed, he said, they could offer such items to the U.S.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> then inquired
                        whether the Secretary had any ideas or proposals regarding the possibility
                        of discussion of some of the things that he had discussed earlier with the
                        Secretary and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d21fn2">See <ref target="#d2">Document 2</ref>; the
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> has not
                            been further identified.</note> He disclaimed that he was in any way
                        attempting to push the administration but only wondered when, how, and where
                        discussion of particular items could take place. He mentioned as subjects of
                        this sort disarmament, a peaceful German settlement including West Berlin,
                        and improvement of relations between the two countries.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that with regard to the last general question it is useful
                        to find specific points on which progress can be made—big questions are made
                        up of many little questions. Normal diplomatic means should be used to find
                        points capable of resolution. He said that we feel disarmament to be of the
                        utmost importance, mentioning that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>, who has been charged with this responsibility, is
                        undertaking intensive work in close collaboration with the Secretary. Our
                        priority attention first goes to the question of nuclear testing where we
                        must have a little time for review. He suggested it might be useful at an
                        appropriate time for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> to discuss these matters. The disarmament question as
                        a whole is more comprehensive and complex and probably would require a
                        little more time than review of the testing question. He noted that it is
                        difficult to insulate or isolate disarmament from the general situation
                        regarding our relations. The Ambassador said that a disarmament settlement
                        would settle most other things as well.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> noted that the
                        U.S. aide-memoire<note n="3" xml:id="d21fn3">See <ref target="#d12">Document
                                12</ref>.</note> included the two points of an air transport
                        agreement and consulates. The Secretary had also mentioned widening the
                        scope of the exchanges. He, the Ambassador, had added the subject of trade
                        which he considers important. Finally, the President had mentioned
                        cooperation in the scientific field.<note n="4" xml:id="d21fn4">For text of
                            the State of the Union address, January 30, during which the President
                            made this suggestion, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the
                                Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">John F.
                                    Kennedy</persName>, 1961</hi>, pp. 19-28.</note> The Ambassador
                        asked if the Secretary had any idea how and when these questions might be
                        discussed. The Secretary said he hoped to be able to work out something
                        after Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> arrives.
                        After discussion with him the U.S. might be in a position to make some
                        suggestions.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName>, unofficially, if he thought there was any point
                        of raising the question of lessening travel restrictions, which are now
                        anomalous. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> said
                        he personally favored such relaxation and said that on several occasions in
                        the past his Government had tried to approach this matter but each time
                        something happened in the field of foreign relations which prevented
                        development. He said that a year ago when preparations were being made for
                        the visit of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> all
                        kinds of things were developing in this direction and everyone was hopeful
                        that steps forward, including this particular problem, could be taken. They
                        now again hope for a radical improvement of the situation. He suggested that
                        progress in other fields might have a good result in the field of travel
                        restrictions. He said the restrictions were left over from the last war and
                        noted that they applied to all foreigners, not just Americans. The Secretary
                        said he fully understood that security of certain installations would have
                        to be retained both in this country and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Close-in protection could be provided while the rest of
                        the country could be open.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary expressed the hope that quiet employment of normal diplomatic
                        channels could give both sides a better approach to larger questions. The
                        Ambassador said that he felt an exchange of views on all questions was
                        useful either in Washington or Moscow or both places simultaneously. He
                        noted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> yesterday had
                        expressed the hope that in the future the two countries could go into all
                        international forums with joint views.<note n="5" xml:id="d21fn5">A 3-page

                            February 2, which covered the same topics as his conversation with

                            State, Central Files, 611.61/2-261. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>'s briefing memorandum for this meeting is ibid.,
                            601.6111/2-161.</note> The Secretary said it is important to guarantee
                        the success of important debates in international forums since the effect of
                        failure is serious. The Ambassador said this was indeed the Soviet approach,
                        i.e., through discussion in diplomatic channels to establish a <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0086"/>common basic point of view. The Secretary
                        said that the significance of a new Administration in Washington is that it
                        offers an opportunity to both sides to review the situation. Such review can
                        open the way to a common approach at least in some questions. The Secretary
                        said that the Administration has no illusions that the problems involved are
                        simple. The Ambassador said that with a common desire the two countries
                        could do many things. The Secretary suggested that we need also to find a
                        common vocabulary—we need to examine this question in a relaxed fashion. The
                        Ambassador agreed that words have different meanings in our two societies.
                        This is natural, he said, given the difference of our ideologies. Neither
                        one of us will persuade the other, he said, but we can co-exist. The
                        Secretary agreed that the important questions between the countries are not
                        ideological—but we must be careful in the field of action and be sure we
                        understand each other in this regard. The Ambassador said that the Soviet
                        Union is all in favor of a quiet purposeful approach involving reasonable
                        compromises. But this must be on an equal basis and there must be no attempt
                        to achieve any one-sided settlement.</p>
                    <p>As the Ambassador left, the Secretary said he hoped he would see the
                        Ambassador and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> at the
                        President's reception on the 8th.</p>

                        confirms its agreement to conduct negotiations for purpose concluding
                        agreement on air communications between <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and USA. Soviet representatives can start these

                    <p>The requirement that Soviet correspondents be finger printed if they remain
                        more than one year in this country applies to all nonimmigrant aliens.<note n="3" xml:id="d23fn3">On March 24 and 28 <persName corresp="#p_MSJM1">McSweeney</persName> discussed this question with Soviet Embassy
                            representatives, stating that the fingerprinting issue was being
                            considered, but that until a final decision was made Soviet
                            correspondents would not be fingerprinted. (Memoranda of conversation;
                            Department of State, Central Files, 911.6261/3-2461 and 3-2861)</note>
                        It is also true that the Soviet Union does not require such finger printing
                        of our correspondents but it does place many other impediments in their
                        way.</p>
                    <p>The objections of Soviet correspondents to comply with this requirement was
                        first brought to the attention of the Department of State in October 1960.
                        In November the Department informed the Minister Consular of the Soviet
                        Embassy (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMN1">Smirnovsky</persName>) that the
                        question would be reviewed.</p>
                    <p>For the moment the Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service has agreed to
                        the Soviet correspondents remaining in the United States without complying
                        with the finger printing requirement.</p>
                    <p>For your information only, conversations were held between the Department of
                        State and the Immigration Service on this subject as late as last week and
                        indications are that the nonimmigrant alien finger printing requirement will
                        be removed. If this is decided upon it requires action by the Secretary of
                        State and the Attorney General who jointly and formally agreed to the
                        present system. This Department does not think it would be helpful to engage
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">Sagatelyan</persName> in a polemic inasmuch
                        as this might have an adverse effect on American correspondents in
                        Moscow.</p>
                    <p>American news correspondents in Moscow are subjected to rigid censorship and
                        are subject to having their six months' residence permits unrenewed if they
                        fail to report the news in a manner favorable to Soviet interests.</p>
                    <p>Most important, however, is the difficulty in getting American correspondents
                        admitted to the Soviet Union. The U.S. Government has not refused a visa to
                        any Soviet correspondent desiring to come to the United <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0089"/>States during the past several years. In
                        contrast the Soviet Government has failed to take positive action on the
                        application of a reputable American news organization, Fairchild
                        Publications, which wishes to station a permanent correspondent in Moscow.
                        The New York Herald Tribune informed us Thursday that it was concerned
                        because a visa had not been issued yet to Walter Lister who will replace Tom
                        Lambert in Moscow. Lambert is leaving Moscow having finished his tour, but
                        his dispatches have been severely criticized by the Soviet Government.</p>
                    <p>Attached is a statement prepared by our Soviet Affairs Office on the
                        Fairchild Publications' application. Enclosed also is a memo from the Visa
                        Office about the refusal of Mr. Shishkin, presently Chief of the <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> Office in New York City, to apply for an
                        extension of stay as required by the law.<note n="4" xml:id="d23fn4">Neither

                    </p>
                    <p>It is felt that you could help by mentioning the problem of getting American
                        correspondents into Moscow. The Department would appreciate anything that
                        you could tell us about the results of your conversation.</p>

                    <p>At an interagency meeting on Cuba, February 7, 1961, Adolph Berle, Chief of
                        the Department of State's Latin American Task Force, “indicated that he had
                        given considerable thought to the establishment of a naval blockade of Cuba
                        as a weapon against the Castro regime.” The Department of Defense
                        representative, Haydn Williams, reported that “a blockade of Cuba was
                        physically feasible” and “to be effective, would require the stopping,
                        boarding and searching of all vessels destined to Cuba, regardless of flag.”
                        Williams commented further that he thought “the Soviet Government would
                        consider such treatment of its vessels as an act of war.” For text of the
                        memorandum reporting on the meeting, see <ref target="frus1961-63v10">

                    <p>[Here follow observations <persName corresp="#p_KGF1">Kennan</persName> made
                        on the work of the Policy Planning Staff.]</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KGF1">Kennan</persName> made the following
                        observations on matters of substance:</p>
                    <p>There is little hope now for negotiation with the Russians on the fundamental
                        problems such as disarmament and the division of Europe. We are likely to
                        make more progress through reciprocal unilateral actions or tacit
                        arrangements rather than signed agreements. This may be especially true in
                        the disarmament field.</p>
                    <p>The US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> have many points of
                        common interest. We should endeavor to locate them and work on them. The
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would welcome (1) the removal of
                        the captive nations resolution from the Congressional calendar, and (2)
                        strengthening commercial relations with the US, which to them would have
                        symbolic political significance.</p>
                    <p>We should drop the problem of Hungary in relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as it is an irritant and we cannot help
                        the Hungarian people by continuing to press it.</p>
                    <p>It might be possible to work out informally with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> a mutually agreed arms limitation policy for Africa, even
                        if this means US concessions regarding existing bases in North Africa.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> with all his bluster is a
                        sensitive man. We need patience and humor in dealing with him. We should not
                        be worried by his statement that the Soviet Union intends to bury us—this
                        was metaphorical, and the Soviet leaders know where their real interests
                        lie.</p>
                    <p>The question of Sino-Soviet relations appears to be one for intelligence
                        analysis rather than planning. We cannot do much to influence these
                        relations but we must constantly observe them.</p>
                    <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0091"/>
                    <p>We have an identity with Russia in the Far East. Japan should not be a
                        barrier in our relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. It
                        might be helpful if we agreed to withdraw our bases from Japan and made a
                        Far East agreement with Japan and Russia. This could in turn help us deal
                        with the Korean problem.</p>
                    <p>We have much more difficult problems with the Chinese than with the Russians.
                        The latter have more in common with Western civilization.<note n="2" xml:id="d25fn2">In a similar discussion on February 20, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> stressed that
                            Soviet officials emphasized trade in every conversation with him. He
                            added that U.S. willingness to make trade arrangements with the Soviet
                            Union “would be an evidence to them of good intentions.” <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> added that Moscow saw the
                            Middle East as one of its greatest opportunities and he believed that
                            their greatest problem was containment of Communist China. <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> concluded that the best thing
                            the United States could do to put strain on relations between China and
                            the Soviet Union was to make progress bilaterally with the latter.

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. General condition of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and its government</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> reported that, in
                        a general way, the Soviet Government is strong, and Soviet economic growth a
                        formidable fact. But agriculture is a deep problem; the government may be
                        facing a third successive year of bad harvests.</p>
                    <p>On the industrial side, while there are still problems in the process of
                        control and decentralization of the growing machine, prospects for continued
                        strong growth are good, and the regime can use these resources in a showy
                        way—as for example by constructing the largest heated swimming pool in the
                        world. Both at home and abroad we can expect new Soviet activities as the
                        economic base grows.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, there is a rapid growth in consumer demand. When there was
                        almost no new housing, public pressure for more was slight, but now everyone
                        has a friend with a new house, and “the appetite grows with eating,”
                        especially while the apparatus of terror is left unused. In agriculture, the
                        avoidance of terror complicates a problem already made difficult by
                        technological backwardness: Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> pointed out in this connection that the agricultural
                        experts of the Rockefeller Foundation are persuaded that there are deep
                        weaknesses in Soviet work in this area, largely as a result of the influence
                        of Lysenko.<note n="2" xml:id="d26fn2"> Trofim P. Lysenko, Soviet agronomist
                            and biologist whose theories were supported by Stalin.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>But difficulties in agriculture should not obscure the growing strength of
                        the Soviet Union as a whole, or the stability of the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> government. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s personal position is strong.
                        While the Government is a collective enterprise, it is increasingly a
                        collective enterprise of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        supporters. Only if he should face unusually grave difficulties both in
                        agriculture and in foreign affairs would <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s political control be seriously threatened.</p>
                    <p>Soviet military strength is formidable. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> is inclined to believe that in
                        the area of conventional forces this strength may be somewhat exaggerated by
                        most American estimators, but he offers no separate estimate of Soviet
                        missile capability, and he agrees with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>'s comment that in the last five years the general
                        Soviet posture has been made stronger and bolder by growing confidence in
                        the Soviet military position. On the other hand, there was general agreement
                        with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KGF1">Kennan</persName>'s comment that Soviet
                        leaders do not think in terms of a narrowly military calculus, and expect to
                        win by the play of other forces, <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0093"/>while their military strength protects the “forces of history” from the
                        “imperialists.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s own deepest desire is to
                        gain time for the forthcoming triumphs of Soviet economic progress; for this
                        he really wants a generally unexplosive period in foreign affairs.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Current Soviet attitudes on foreign affairs</p>
                    <p>While the Soviet attitude toward the world is fundamentally optimistic,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would very much like
                        some specific diplomatic successes in 1961. Perhaps his first hope here is
                        that, through negotiations with the new American administration, there may
                        be progress toward disarmament. Soviet interest in this area appears real;
                        “we do have one common enemy—war.” While <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s interest in exploiting Berlin continues, he is
                        not likely to bring this situation to a boil unless there is a breakdown of
                        negotiations on disarmament, or perhaps an increase in tension in such a
                        place as Laos.</p>
                    <p>After the United States, the great long-run worries of the Soviet Union are
                        Germany and Red China. These are the countries whose relations to the atomic
                        problem seem an important one to the Soviet Union, and indeed effective
                        restraint of the Chinese Communists is a continuing task of the Soviet
                        government. In this connection, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> recommended—and later agreed to send over—certain
                        documents telling the exact nature of the sharp dialogue between the
                        Russians and the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>But if Soviet concern over Germany's relation to atomic weapons is real, it
                        is also an example of the duality of Soviet thinking: the German question is
                        not only a real worry, but an excellent crowbar with which to pry at the
                        seams of the Atlantic alliance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>, in particular, emphasized that nearly every Soviet
                        argument must be appraised not only as evidence of the rational calculations
                        of a powerful government, but also as part of a process of cynical
                        manipulation by a group of doctrinaires profoundly committed to the
                        advancement of their party and their ideology by every available means.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, around the world Soviet leaders are cheerfully taking advantage of
                        targets of opportunity, and their recent successes in such areas as Laos,
                        the Congo, and Cuba have made them confident, perhaps overconfident, about
                        their prospects in such adventures. In these areas they appear to be
                        following a policy of backing promising political leaders who are hostile to
                        the West, whether or not they are explicitly Communist in their allegiance,
                        in the hope that timely support of such leaders may make easier the gradual
                        growth of Communist influence and the eventual Communist takeover; this is a
                        change from earlier doctrinaire commitment to Communists alone.</p>
                    <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0094"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Useful American policies and attitudes toward the
                        Soviet Union</p>
                    <p>Precisely because of the double character of the Soviet behavior, American
                        policy must be both rationally stated and evidently strong. Strength is not
                        entirely a military matter, and, in some areas, other things are more
                        important. In Laos, for example, allied disunity and the failure of the West
                        to find and support an esteemed non-Communist leader have played into the
                        hands of Communists. Moreover, while strength is essential, noisy
                        demonstrations of strength are likely to be counter-productive, because of
                        the high sensitivity and pride—and perhaps the inferiority complex, in some
                        sense—of the Soviet government. On the other hand, it should not be assumed
                        that the Soviet Union would react violently to a possible swift action
                        against the Castro government. A quick fait accompli would probably lead to
                        only verbal reactions. On the other hand a long civil war might well
                        generate strong pressures upon the Soviet government to prove its greatness
                        on behalf of an embattled ally in the great contest against imperialism. (In
                        this connection, the experts agreed that Soviet intervention in Hungary was
                        on an entirely different plane, resting as it did upon a deep-seated Soviet
                        conviction that a continuation of the Hungarian revolution would have
                        undermined the entire Communist position in Eastern Europe.) In such a case
                        as Berlin, only strength and firmness would do.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Methods of negotiation and the problem of a
                        possible meeting of the President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                    </p>
                    <p>In general, it was felt that we were on the right track in maintaining a
                        quiet and courteous tone in direct exchanges with the Soviet government. The
                        last months of the old administration had created blocks to communication
                        which were now being removed by the fact of a change. While <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> evidently disliked <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> (especially because of a speech to
                        the dentists), he had liked <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> personally, without respecting him very much as a
                        leader. But the events leading up to the Paris summit had been a great blow
                        to his pride, and had so shaken him that further effective negotiation could
                        not occur with the outgoing administration. He is now eager, above all other
                        immediate desires, for an early meeting with the President, and there seemed
                        considerable feeling among the experts that a meeting in due course, for an
                        exchange of courtesies and the opportunity of becoming personally
                        acquainted, might be useful. Nothing approaching a summit, in terms of
                        serious negotiations, should be considered favorably for the present. There
                        was a strong feeling, sharply expressed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>, that it would be unwise to have <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> come to the United Nations, as a
                        means toward any early meeting, because the Soviet leader cannot resist a
                        rostrum, and his speeches in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would be
                        unlikely to add to the sum of international good will, or Soviet-American
                        understanding.</p>
                    <p>Thus it might well be wise to indicate quite promptly to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that, while the President looks
                        forward to meeting him before too much <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0095"/>time has passed, it does not look as if a meeting in connection with the
                        General Assembly would be possible or productive. In this same connection,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> suggested that the
                        President might well say quite candidly that it would be hard to meet with
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> before he has had a
                        chance to meet and talk with the heads of the principal allied
                        governments.</p>
                    <p>But if courtesy and a moderate tone of voice are appropriate in our first
                        exchanges with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, there is
                        no reason to tolerate or leave without comment the continuing Soviet attempt
                        to use both the high road and the low road. Savage and continuing
                        denunciation of the United States as the principal enemy of mankind, from
                        the highest levels of the Soviet government, is not really consistent with
                        effective negotiation between the two great states, and this point can
                        usefully be made. If they believe these things, what chance is there we can
                        reach reliable agreements with each other? If they do not believe them, what
                        use is there in our sitting down to talk with such obviously cynical
                        opponents?</p>
                    <p>The President, in any meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, would wish to show both a willingness to
                        negotiate reasonably and great strength and firmness. He would wish to avoid
                        the fuzziness which made trouble for President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> in the Berlin negotiations—it never helps in
                        negotiating with the Russians to use ambiguous words or phrases which may be
                        taken in quite different ways by the two sides.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that there would be no decision at present on the question of a
                        meeting. Meanwhile communications with the Soviet Union could usefully
                        continue, through diplomatic channels, on a variety of topics, as further
                        examination might decree. Among the topics considered as likely for such
                        treatment were Laos, commercial conversations, the consular convention, air
                        transport, exchange of persons, and of course the test ban negotiations.
                        These last may be perhaps the most important element in American-Soviet
                        relations in the immediate future.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">In Conclusion:</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>, in response to a
                        concluding question from the President, summarized the requirements upon the
                        United States in four steps: first, and most important, we must make our own
                        system work. Second, we must maintain the unity of the West. Third, we must
                        find ways of placing ourselves in new and effective relations to the great
                        forces of nationalism and anti-colonialism. Fourth, we must, in these ways
                        and others, change our image before the world so that it becomes plain that
                        we and not the Soviet Union stand for the future.</p>

                            Gizenga.<note n="3" xml:id="d28fn3"> Antoine Gizenga, Acting Prime
                            Minister of the Congo.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> remarked that this would certainly <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0097"/>change the tactical picture in New York.
                        Reference was made to previous Soviet behavior regarding former <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> Trygve Lie. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that in that period the Soviets had addressed
                        their communications to the Secretariat. Sir Harold asked if the sharpness
                        and nature of the <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> statement made it
                        possible for us to gain anything from this “ill wind.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> suggested any <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution on the Congo would now automatically be subjected
                        to Soviet veto.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the subject of the present meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> noted that there was little
                        likelihood of any real difference regarding the subject, that we had
                        prepared a brief paper<note n="4" xml:id="d28fn4">This paper has not been
                            identified further.</note> which stopped short of conclusions and
                        suggested that the meeting might usefully hear from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> opened by
                        referring to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        conversations with German Ambassador Kroll and the Icelandic Ambassador in
                        which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had said that the
                        Soviets could not wait on the Berlin situation until after German elections.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName> had been making equivocating noises
                        but <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was sounding tough.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> considered that
                        a lot would depend on the international setting. If the testing talks go
                        well and there is movement elsewhere, if the Soviets conclude that there is
                        an effort to solve some of our problems, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would probably go along some distance. He might
                        agree to some type of procedural start before the elections which continued
                        after the elections were held. On the other hand, if we seem to have locked
                        horns at all junctures, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        would almost certainly proceed with a separate treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. He has somewhat of a commitment to get
                        along with the German problem and would only withhold pressure if he can
                        show that his policy is “getting somewhere” elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>Sir Harold said that the Soviets seemed to have designated three areas in
                        which they wanted to get somewhere: reform of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, disarmament and Germany. It appears they have thrown their
                        hat in the ring on the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and taken a hard
                        stand on reforming the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> completely.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said he viewed
                        the Soviet drive on the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as a long-range
                        project. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> does not seem
                        sure how he can do it and had even vacillated some in his attitude toward
                        the Secretary General. When Lord Hood asked if he understood that the drive
                        on the UN was not in the same order of priority as the other two questions,
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> answered that
                        was his view. Sir Harold observed that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has already firmly joined the issue on the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and asked if he could abandon this firm
                        position. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said
                        it was possible that he could, that in his opinion <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would not try to force all his
                        proposals through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> this year.</p>
                    <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0098"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> asked how
                        seriously <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would take the
                        Lumumba <note n="5" xml:id="d28fn5">Patrice Lumumba, former Prime Minister
                            of the Republic of the Congo, was killed on January 17.</note> affair.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had little concern for Lumumba
                        personally, that he had told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> that he was sorry for him as a person when he was
                        in prison but that his imprisonment actually served Soviet interests.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s personal commitment
                        is deepest of all regarding Berlin and the pressure is greatest on him
                        here.</p>
                    <p>Sir Harold asked what other subjects than Berlin could we hope to get any
                        movement on. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>
                        said there were divergent reports regarding Soviet intentions at the testing
                        talks, but that he was inclined to believe that they were prepared to make
                        substantive concessions and to get an agreement. However, it was possible
                        that the ChiComs may have cooled them off on the testing agreement or that
                        the Soviets may have taken the measure of the cost of the requisite
                        inspection and concluded that it was too great.</p>
                    <p>Sir Harold observed that the Chinese Ambassador in Moscow had told British
                        Ambassador Roberts that the ChiComs hoped a testing agreement would be
                        reached so that they would not be forced to go ahead with the production of
                        costly nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said the Pugwash
                        meeting in Moscow had been interesting.<note n="6" xml:id="d28fn6">Reference
                            is to the Conference on War in the Nuclear Age, held November-December
                            1960 in Moscow.</note> He thought that it has encouraged the Soviets to
                        think now that we are more serious about disarmament than they had thought
                        before. The talks had revealed how deeply we had been exploring the problems
                        of arms control.</p>
                    <p>Sir Harold asked for U.S. thoughts on how to spin things along and achieve a
                        delay on Berlin. Lord Hood observed that he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> had concluded the other day that we
                        could get nothing better than a status quo and that no initiative on our
                        part in Germany or Berlin was therefore worthwhile. Sir Harold said he
                        understood that part of our answer was to have a serious try at achieving a
                        testing agreement and perhaps go slow at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The latter, he remarked, had now become much more
                        difficult.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> saw no good reason for us
                        actively to seek a Berlin-Germany settlement. He said we can live with the
                        status quo and even in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> discussions it
                        had been agreed that there were real dangers in a summit meeting on the
                        single subject of Berlin. The question was what field offered the best
                        chances of bringing about some relaxation of tension without facing a
                        show-down on an issue like Berlin.</p>
                    <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0099"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> offered his
                        personal view that it was necessary to have some sort of program regarding
                        Germany and Berlin. We must take it for granted that the Soviets will raise
                        the subject at some time or other and we must be ready to talk about it.
                        There was some danger that things such as Kroll's talk with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might lead the Soviets to
                        believe that after the German elections they can expect to gain substantial
                        Western concessions. However, Kroll had never given any idea of what would
                        be changed in the German position by the elections.</p>
                    <p>Sir Harold asked what were they seeking from us and noted that this meant
                        essentially what do the Germans have to offer? He referred to the obvious
                        field of securing the eastern frontiers of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> remarked that it might be helpful if the Germans
                        would proceed to establish more extensive relations with the Poles, and
                        possibly the Czechs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> said that there was some
                        danger in this position of leaving Berlin on ice until after the election.
                        The danger was that this would tend to store up a powerful head of steam for
                        a big show-down. Ambassador Dowling would be coming back shortly and perhaps
                        we can find out something regarding the Germans' thinking on discussions
                        with the Soviets after elections. There might be something in German
                        preparedness to recognize the Oder-Neisse line and this, of course, very
                        closely affected German elections.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> remarked that
                        Ambassador Kroll held some dangerous ideas, for example, regarding the
                        possibility of a meeting to draw up the terms of a peace treaty. Ambassador
                        Kroll might be thinking of this as a stalling tactic but it would obviously
                        have the effect of deceiving and confusing the public in Western
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Sir Harold asked if there had been any private communications from the
                        Germans to the Russians. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said that, if so, it would have been by Kroll
                        personally. Kroll seems to aspire to be the man that changed the course of
                        post-war history.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> asked if the Oder-Neisse
                        line is as important to the Russians as to the Poles. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> thought yes. It was needed to
                        jell the situation in Eastern Europe, and that objective was high on the
                        Soviet list. If the western Polish borders were changed in the slightest,
                        the Soviets felt the Poles would look for compensating changes in the East.
                        Lord Hood asked if they were more interested in this than in getting us out
                        of Berlin. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said
                        yes, but that the East Germans were, of course, more interested in Berlin.
                        However, the Soviets could hold the East Germans in line if they wished
                        to.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> referred to the
                        correspondence in late 1957 and early 1958 regarding the lists of topics
                        that the West and the Soviet Union might discuss at a meeting. He asked
                        whether there were any possibilities along this line or whether the Soviets
                        were pressing for a quick summit <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0100"/>meeting. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said
                        that the Soviets had been pressing us on Berlin and would continue to do so.
                        Their line is that if we do not like their proposals, what do we suggest?
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> observed that our previous
                        proposals had lasted only about 10 minutes (in 1959).</p>
                    <p>Lord Hood asked if the Germans would have to be in on any discussions.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said that
                        apparently <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>
                        <note n="7" xml:id="d28fn7">
                            <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Walter Ulbricht</persName>, Chairman of the
                            Socialist Unity Party of Germany.</note> had supported <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> strongly at the November <gloss target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss> meeting but that we don't know whether
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> paid any price for
                        this support. There seemed some evidence that the Russians were not
                        particularly happy with <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> right
                        now.</p>
                    <p>Sir Harold remarked that Lord Home had followed the advice of the British
                        Ambassador in Moscow and referred to the harsh essence of the statement of
                        the Communist parties and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s January 6 speech. <hi rend="italic">Izvestiya</hi>
                        had reacted sharply, asking if he were the minister of the cold war.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> observed that we had
                        circulated these documents to our missions, that the Secretary and the
                        President had both called public attention to them and their significance
                        and that we were working on the possibility of preparing an annotated
                        edition of the documents.</p>
                    <p>Sir Harold wondered whether the sharp Soviet response to Lord Home were not
                        meant for the U.S. as well as the British. He noted our problem of not
                        fooling the public while we were stringing the Russians along. How we would
                        do the stringing along was not clear except for the field of testing. The
                        prospect for anything in disarmament would take much longer. Should
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> come to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss>
                        release today would make it extremely hard to imagine the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> proceeding in a restrained manner.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said that there
                        was the possibility of a settlement in Laos which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could regard as some
                        achievement. It was not clear how the Soviets were going to play the
                        situation. They seemed disposed to let the Administration have some time to
                        organize its approach but any successes tempted them to continue a hard
                        line. It was hard for them to “renounce any opportunities.”</p>
                    <p>Sir Harold referred to Laos, the Congo and Cuba as three areas of progress
                        from the Soviet point of view. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may find that he does not want to push too fast
                        toward an accommodation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said it was doubtful that
                        anything in the bilateral field such as exchanges would restrain the Soviets
                        on the international front. He asked whether a series of meetings per se
                        which would not be negotiations would have any virtue. For example, would
                        the prospect or actuality <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0101"/>of a
                        meeting with the President deter them? Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s personal point of view he
                        would, of course, see that there were gains involved and it could have great
                        importance to him. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> asked
                        whether this would restrain him from raising concrete issues. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> replied that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would raise Berlin at any
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>Sir Harold said that it would not be easy for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to come to the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> now. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>
                        said that New York was a bad place for a possible meeting between the
                        President and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Given the
                        nature of the issues before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and the
                        chance to use the propaganda forum furnished by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> rostrum, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        would be sure to employ it and would have to put on his Bolshevik hat in
                        doing so.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> remarked that
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may come any way. If
                        so, it would be better if he came at the end of the session. Sir Harold said
                        that the U.K. Ambassador to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAH1">Dean</persName>, reported some sentiment in
                        New York for a quiet end to the current <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> session but Sir Harold noted that this would probably mean
                        a later special session on disarmament. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> said that the Soviet proposal for the special
                        disarmament session had never been withdrawn but had not been recently
                        pushed.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> reported that
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> (Soviet First Deputy
                        Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Council of Ministers)
                        had made a point of stressing that the Soviet disarmament moves in the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should not be dismissed as propaganda,
                        that they were part of the serious Soviet approach to the problem.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said that this
                        meant that they viewed their <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> operations as
                        an attempt to force us into disarmament negotiations as part of their effort
                        to overcome what they describe as the barriers interposed by the “Pentagon”
                        and “Wall Street” to disarmament negotiations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> added that this was true even though
                        the current exercise itself was pure propaganda.</p>
                    <p>Sir Harold asked whether from the U.S. point of view it was easier to foresee
                        a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> if he was
                        brought into the U.S. by other means than a special invitation to him. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> asked whether it was
                        excluded that the Soviets would issue an invitation to the President.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said it was not
                        excluded but not likely. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>
                        said the Soviets would fear a rebuff; Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> noted that there would undoubtedly be some feelers
                        put out first. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>
                        said the Soviets would want to know where the U.S. stood regarding current
                        issues, that they would have to know this before they could determine what
                        type treatment they should give the President during a visit. He believed
                        that any invitation in the immediate future was almost excluded.</p>
                    <p>Sir Harold stated that another awkward thing about a new <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> session would be facing the Chinese
                        representation issue again. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>
                        <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0102"/>said that the moratorium issue had
                        been disposed of for this session but that the representation issue could
                        still crop up in another form.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> considered that
                        the Soviets were likely to start pushing for a summit meeting, even though
                        they might think we are now more seriously approaching the disarmament
                        question. The Soviets would want to gain credit for renewal of
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> said that he might put a
                        little less emphasis on the kudos which the Soviets anticipate from a summit
                        meeting per se. If their desire for such a meeting were in fact deeper than
                        he thought, it might be useful to get word to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that he could not expect to get such a meeting if
                        current Soviet conduct was continued.</p>
                    <p>It was generally agreed that the West should not be hastened into a
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> reverted to the previous
                        remarks that it might be better for the U.S. to take the initiative rather
                        than being forced into a meeting. He added that this would, of course,
                        involve other allies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>
                        said that it could be very dangerous if we did not know where we wanted to
                        go on the Berlin question. We would have to take a look at this problem with
                        Ambassador Dowling. One maneuver might be procedural, such as convening a
                        Foreign Ministers meeting not long before the German elections which could
                        carry over until after the elections. This could serve as a buffer to Soviet
                        moves. So far the Germans have not even let us know what they themselves
                        have in mind.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> read the <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> item regarding the Congo and the
                        Secretary General and Sir Harold observed that there was little evidence of
                        restraint in it.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said that from our
                        point of view it might be better than a cool and detached statement. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said even this statement
                        doesn't exclude the possibility of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> coming to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        and might even serve as a basis for coming.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> asked whether the
                        Soviet statement meant that the Soviet Union representative would not
                        communicate with <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> and not
                        attend meetings at which he was present. Lord Hood and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> agreed that he probably would not
                        communicate with <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> but
                        would attend meetings at which he was present without addressing him.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said this was illustrative
                        of the indeterminate stage our relations were now in, that the Department
                        would want to consult further with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>, particularly in preparation for the next round of
                        talks with the British.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> must realize he cannot get the
                        votes he needs to remove the Secretary General unless he thinks that great
                        emotions have been stirred by Lumumba's death. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> added that the Soviets had indicated
                        they got all they expected on the first round. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>
                        <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0103"/>opined that they might ask for a
                        special session to consider what they would describe as a crime against
                        humanity.</p>
                    <p>Sir Harold attempted to sum up the discussion. We were agreed that it was
                        useful to spin things along and that our actions in the testing negotiations
                        and our efforts to achieve a settlement in Laos were part of the process. He
                        asked whether it might not help to riposte in some manner. Could we not come
                        back in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>; might we not poll the
                        delegations informally to see what might be done in the nature of a
                        confidence vote for the Secretary General? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> was
                        not in session; could we call a session in order to put the brakes on
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>? Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said that we must find a way of
                        saying convincingly that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cannot run
                        away from its responsibilities in the Congo.</p>
                    <p>Sir Harold asked if there was any possibility of a response to the Venus
                        shot. He referred to the Western actions reaffirming their unity after the
                        Sputnik and asked if there was any way we could show <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> we were doing something.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> expressed his
                        personal reservations regarding the advisability of rushing into some action
                        in the scientific field. He had felt that we should see how the situation
                        was developing before making more specific the President's suggestions
                        regarding cooperative scientific endeavors and now we had probably better
                        look still closer. Sir Harold said that it was sometimes possible in the
                        wake of startling actions by the Soviets to do politically what ordinarily
                        would be unthinkable.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brimelow asked if the toughness of the <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> statement did not make summitry itself less thinkable.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> asked for Sir
                        Harold's first reaction on how we could meet the probable Soviet moves in
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Sir Harold said we should do
                        something to show him that he does not have a majority behind him.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said that Soviet
                        support of Gizenga was now at least out in the open but that this meant that
                        they would be unwilling to work with the Congolese government.</p>
                    <p>Sir Harold adverted to Laos and said the British thought they would have had
                        an answer to their proposal last week but they had not yet received one.</p>

                    <p>You will recall that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> presented an aide-memoire to the Soviet Government
                        on January 24 which indicated that the United States Government was prepared
                        to proceed with negotiations for an air transport agreement with the
                        U.S.S.R. On February 4, the Soviet Government accepted our proposal and
                        suggested that negotiations begin at a mutually agreeable date. We now
                        propose to deliver an aide-memoire to the Soviet Embassy stating that we
                        will present a draft agreement within the next 30 days and that we suggest
                        that negotiations be held in Washington at a mutually agreeable time once
                        the Soviet Government has completed its examination of our draft
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>Negotiations for an air transport agreement with the Soviet Government were
                        scheduled to have begun last July 18. They were postponed on July 14 at our
                        initiative following the shooting down of the RB-47 aircraft. The original
                        undertaking for an air transport agreement was contained in the
                        U.S.-U.S.S.R. Exchange Agreement of January 27, 1958 and repeated in the
                        Exchange Agreement of November 21, 1959. The United States had on several
                        occasions since 1958 attempted to obtain Soviet agreement to an actual
                        commencement of negotiations but only in March of last year did the Soviet
                        Government finally make a concrete proposal. The United States accepted the
                        Soviet proposal, and negotiations, as I have indicated, were set for July.
                        On the eve of the negotiations, the Soviet Government presented a draft
                        agreement, but the negotiations were postponed before we were able to submit
                        a counterdraft.</p>
                    <p>In the general context of improving relations with the Soviet Union, we have
                        two principal aims for an air transport agreement. The first is the safe and
                        orderly development of direct air transportation between the two countries
                        on the basis of reciprocal rights consistent with our national security.
                        Secondly, we foresee an intelligence benefit as well as some advantage in
                        demonstrating the high state of our civil aviation to <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0105"/>the Soviet people. We would insure, of
                        course, that any agreement contained adequate provisions for possible
                        suspension or termination if this should subsequently be in our
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>Pan American Airways was certificated some time ago by the Civil Aeronautics
                        Board as the American carrier to serve the U.S.S.R. We would expect that a
                        representative of Pan American would participate in the negotiations in an
                        observer status. The route so far proposed by both sides has been New
                        York-Moscow with no “beyond” rights.</p>
                    <p>If you approve, we will deliver to the Soviet Embassy an aide-memoire along
                        the lines I have mentioned.<note n="3" xml:id="d29fn3">On February 20

                        below.</p>
                    <p>1. Interim Report on Implementation of U.S.-U.S.S.R. Exchanges Under November
                        21, 1959 Agreement. This paper reviews the implementation for 1960 of the
                        current America-Soviet Agreement and reflects that only about 40 percent of
                        the planned exchanges have been completed. The performance within the
                        several categories varies for different reasons, the primary ones being
                        Soviet interest in scientific and technical exchanges, reluctance to engage
                        in long-term exchanges and a desire to avoid informational exchanges.</p>
                    <p>2. Exchanges with Eastern Europe and Possibilities for Expansion. This paper
                        reviews exchanges with Eastern European countries and indicates that, except
                        in the case of Poland, exchange activity has been strictly limited because
                        of the unfavorable political climate in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, the
                        cautious attitude of Rumania, and the only recent resumption of diplomatic
                        relations with Bulgaria. Modest and gradual increases can be expected with
                        Rumania and Bulgaria, but there is little hope for any significant change in
                        the cases of Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The large-scale Polish program is
                        unique because exchanges have been developed and financed primarily by
                        private American groups, particularly the Ford and Rockerfeller Foundations.
                        The opportunities in Poland are still large but these are limited by the
                        attitude of the Polish Government and the available political funds.</p>
                    <p>3. Background Considerations: Expansion of Soviet Bloc Exchanges. This paper
                        considers the basic factors involved in joining in exchange programs with
                        the Soviet Union, notes the inherent risks and the need to negotiate firmly
                        for equivalent advantages, but concludes that exchanges arranged and carried
                        out imaginatively, persistently, and with adequate resources of trained
                        personnel and funds can be responsive to and advance our long term
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>4. Possible Increases in Exchanges Program with the Soviet Union. This paper
                        reviews the possibilities for expansion of exchanges with the Soviet Union
                        and suggests specific fields in which these exchanges may be increased. It
                        also sets forth financial requirements for this expansion and recommends
                        measures to increase the efficiency of administrative procedures.</p>

                        outlined the status of planning and preparation, following which the group

                        US Government.</p>

                    <p>(2) <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> intimated he might welcome
                        meeting with Secretary of Commerce as a step toward improved economic
                        relations. However, both he and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> appeared reluctant to take the initiative.</p>
                    <p>(3) <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> stated he had already
                        given order to settle lend-lease debt (prior to January 1960 discussions).
                        “Just treat us as you did the British and we will be satisfied.” He clearly
                        stated this meant assurances that credits would be forthcoming following
                        agreement on lend-lease debt. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>
                        had stated that negotiations regarding credits and a trade agreement should
                        parallel discussions for lend-lease settlement. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> also said <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        prepared to place orders for one billion dollars if credits can be arranged.
                        Both <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> revealed their expectation that
                        present US recession would be factor prompting us to seek expanded trade
                        with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. They realize, however, that lend
                        lease settlement and matters requiring legislation (credits, <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>) will take time. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that in any event substantial
                        trade could be carried on with us on cash basis.</p>

                        Trade officials took same line saying three things need to be done to
                        improve trade relations:</p>
                    <p>(A) Soviet buyers must have assurance that contracts will be honored without
                        interference (e.g. license revocation) by US Government.</p>
                    <p>(B) <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> must be able to sell products with
                        minimum of restrictions (need for <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>).
                        Agreed Soviet products must be geared more effectively to US market.</p>
                    <p>(C) Better psychological atmosphere required among US businessmen. Must want
                        to seek Soviet trade. General attitude of US Government important this
                        respect. Export license determinations on borderline decisions also major
                        factor.</p>
                    <p>(5) Throughout all discussions <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hammer</persName>
                        had clear impression Soviets eager to expand trade with US. <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hammer</persName> stressed in discussions that
                        improvement in economic relations would take time. Soviet officials in all
                        three conversations recognize this and appeared to accept as fact to which
                        they must accommodate.</p>
                    <p>(6) <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hammer</persName> suggested to <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> send
                        representative selection from its art treasures to US for
                        exhibit—particularly selections from Hermitage. Also suggested that Eleanor
                        Roosevelt could be appointed chairman of committee to arrange undertaking
                        and that he believed exhibition could open at National Gallery in Washington
                        followed by exhibits other large cities. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said this an excellent idea and asked <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hammer</persName> to prepare plan for carrying it out.

                    <p>French Ambassador Alphand met with Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> on February 20, 1961, to discuss the

                        “Alphand said he thought we should be very tough with the Soviets and tell
                        them frankly we would not accept a Communist regime in the Congo. He added
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> anyway is not in a
                        good logistic position vis-à-vis the Congo. The Secretary agreed and said
                        that sometimes he thought we were over pessimistic about our own position in
                        the Congo since the Soviets were having troubles too.” For text of the

                    <p>On February 20, 1961, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> called in Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> to inform him that the United States supported the
                        statement issued the previous day by the King of Laos insisting on his <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0110"/>nation's neutrality. However, the
                        United States did not support the King's call for an international
                        conference to work out a settlement in Laos. <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> replied that the Soviet Union supported Laotian
                        neutrality, as it had since the 1954 Geneva Conference. For text of the

                    <p>On February 21 the United States Intelligence Board approved Special National
                        Intelligence Estimate 58-61: “Probable Communist Reactions to Certain U.S.
                        Courses of Action with Respect to Laos.” According to a brief of the SNIE,
                        it expressed the Board's judgment that “except possibly in the case of more
                        extreme U.S. military measures, we believe that Soviet leaders would not
                        match U.S.-sponsored military actions in Laos with corresponding,
                        step-by-step, Bloc military measures. Except in the case of the most modest
                        U.S. military measures Bloc leaders would almost certainly expect that most
                        of world opinion would be sharply critical of the U.S., and that this fact
                        would deter the U.S. from pressing too far.” For text, see ibid., pages

                    <p>On February 28 <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> informed
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> that the Soviet Government
                        believed that the 1954 Geneva Accords were not adequate to resolve the
                        present situation in Laos and therefore supported the call by Prince
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> for an international
                        conference to strengthen the International Control Commission created in the

                    <p>In telegram 2138 to the Department of State from Moscow, March 10, Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> reported on a meeting
                        with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> on Laos,
                        during which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> shared “the same desire as you,
                        namely to end fighting which only sheds blood, gives neither you nor us
                        anything, and hurts relations between us.” <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> welcomed “a Laos that pursues neutral policy on
                        model of Austria” and suggested that Rusk and Gromyko meet to discuss the
                        matter. For text of the telegram, see ibid., pages 80-82.</p>
                    <p>In telegram 2139 to the Department of State from Moscow, March 10, Thompson
                        reported that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> seemed
                        convinced that the United States was “genuinely seeking” neutrality for Laos
                        and was “intrigued by the possibility” of settling the problem. (Ibid., page
                        82, footnote 3) Nevertheless, a <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> meeting
                        in New York on March 18 produced little. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> found Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> “completely elusive,” according to
                        a memorandum of the conversation. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> refused to give substantive answers beyond a
                        repeated insistence that discussions on Laos must begin with an
                        international conference. (Ibid., page 93, source note)</p>

                    <p>While the conversation ranged, as it had in the past, over many subjects, it
                        was clear that the chief purpose of the invitation to lunch was to endeavor
                        to find out exactly what “instructions” Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> was taking back to Moscow, with
                        particular emphasis on disarmament and the question of “normalization” of
                        trade. I explained to <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> that
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>'s consultations here
                        had been of an exploratory and background nature and that it was too soon
                        for any specific or concrete proposals to be made on these two or other
                        subjects; that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> was
                        working on an examination of the entire disarmament picture, but it would be
                        some time before definite conclusions could be reached.</p>
                    <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0112"/>
                    <p>On trade, I told him that the Soviets must understand that under our system
                        of separation of powers, the President could not direct Congress and tell it
                        what to do, (this is an old subject of discussion with <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName>) and that in regard to trade,
                        most of the limitations were embodied in legislation which would require new
                        laws to change, and that the Congressional reaction to effecting such change
                        was at best problematic in the absence of some indication that there was to
                        be an improvement in relations.</p>
                    <p>I referred, in this connection, to the abortive attempt last year to settle
                        the lend lease problem as a first step in a program of removing such
                        limitations. <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> on this point
                        adhered to the previous position that there could be no discussion of lend
                        lease settlement unless accompanied, simultaneously, with negotiations for
                        the removal of limitations and the granting of credits.<note n="2" xml:id="d36fn2">On February 22 <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> had made the same points in a dinner
                            conversation with Secretary of Commerce Hodges (memorandum of
                            conversation, February 23; ibid., 611.61/2-2361) and a letter to
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, February 24 (ibid.,
                            601.6111/2-2461).</note> At the conclusion of this part of the
                        discussion, <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> said that it
                        would appear that the United States position had not changed, and that he
                        “did not envy Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> if this
                        was all he would have to say on this subject.” I told him it would be a
                        mistake to regard any previous position as that necessarily of the new
                        Administration, but that the objective factors which I had outlined were
                        still there to be dealt with.</p>
                    <p>The following is a brief outline of the other subjects covered:</p>
                    <p>1. Laos. <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> repeated that he
                        had told you that our proposal on Laos was “one-sided” and did not take into
                        consideration the attitude of “the other side.”<note n="3" xml:id="d36fn3">See <ref target="#d34">Document 34</ref>.</note> I told him that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had said, in his
                        Inaugural speech, we should concentrate on those areas where we might be
                        able to concentrate on those elements in which we seem to have a common view
                        as against belaboring those which divided us, and in this situation we had
                        one point in common; namely, the desirability of the neutralization of Laos,
                        and that an exchange of views which <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> was authorized to have as to how this principle
                        could be given effect in the mutually acceptable manner would be worthwhile.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> agreed but kept
                        returning to his thesis of the “one-sided” nature of our suggestion.</p>
                    <p>During the discussion, <persName corresp="#p_SMN1">Smirnovsky</persName> made
                        an interesting remark in which he said, “How could Laos be neutral without
                        the inclusion of some communists in the Government?” I pointed out that by
                        definition, any communist-controlled or influenced government could not be
                        neutral, unless I had misread all of the statements that had recently come
                        out on the aims of the communist move. He seemed to realize that he had <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0113"/>made a mistake and rather lamely
                        referred to the presence of communists in the Italian and French Governments
                        at the end of the war. (I believe this inadvertent remark by <persName corresp="#p_SMN1">Smirnovsky</persName> reveals where the main problem
                        will lie in regard to any future Laotian Government.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> said he had been informed
                        by you of our opposition to the idea of a conference and could not see why
                        we were opposed to it. I told him that it appeared to us to be a mechanism
                        for the exacerbation of the situation in Laos rather than a practical method
                        of handling it.</p>
                    <p>2. Germany and Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> asked
                        me if <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> would raise the
                        question of Berlin, to which I replied that since they, and not we, were
                        seeking a change in the present circumstances, this was not a question we
                        would raise. He then asked what <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>'s view would be in the event that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> raised it. I told him that
                        beyond the very obvious elements of the United States position, which would
                        not be subject to change, Thompson had no specific instructions. These
                        elements, as I saw them, were:</p>
                    <p>(a) We were not prepared to accept anything in regard to West Berlin which
                        would derogate or impair the position of the Western Powers in that city
                        which was ours by right, reinforced by agreement.</p>
                    <p>(b) The Soviet Union should understand that it would not be possible for the
                        United States or its allies to accept a political or diplomatic defeat over
                        Berlin, and</p>
                    <p>(c) Finally, that, of course, <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> would report, confidentially, whatever views Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> chose to give him.</p>
                    <p>I added, on my own, that I thought the whole situation in Germany was
                        abnormal, including Berlin as a city, and that you could not claim one part
                        alone—West Berlin—as abnormal, to be dealt with in isolation; adding that,
                        personally, I could not see why the existing situation in Berlin could not
                        be left alone even if the Soviet Union felt it essential to make some
                        arrangement of a peace treaty nature with East Germany, which, of course, we
                        would not approve or recognize but this was essentially their business.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> did not pursue the
                        subject of Berlin further.</p>
                    <p>3. On the Congo. <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> raised,
                        himself, their attitude toward <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>, saying that here we had a profound and deep
                        difference—with which I agreed. He said he could well understand our support
                        of <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> since he was “our
                        man,” to which I replied it was difficult to see how any individual could
                        have been more objective and neutral than <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>, and that the Soviet denial of the possibility
                        of a genuinely objective or neutral figure in an international position was
                        an extremely serious one which would have an effect on any form of control
                        of inspection in the disarmament field or nuclear test bans and one to which
                        I did not see much of an answer if they persisted in this attitude.</p>
                    <p>4. Test Negotiation. <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> agreed
                        that the nuclear tests negotiations might afford the first real opportunity
                        to agree on something, but did not go into any detail of the unresolved
                        issue except to state that too <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0114"/>many
                        on-site inspections would be a reflection of suspicion and distrust, which
                        would be a bad thing. I told him that on the contrary, that if we were to be
                        realistic and serious, that an excess of assurance for verifying the mutual
                        observance of such an agreement was infinitely preferable to inadequate
                        assurance, pointing out, in this connection, that any agreement would have
                        to attain the support of Congress if it were to be adopted by this
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>In general, the conversation followed along the standard lines of previous
                        talks I have had with <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName>, with
                        the exception of his intense interest in finding out whether <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> was taking back something
                        “concrete” in the way of propositions. He seemed to be disappointed when I
                        told him that <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> would have no
                        new proposals but was thoroughly familiar with the President's thinking on
                        the general subject of our relations with the Soviet Union and that the
                        possibility to avoid unnecessary misunderstanding through exchange of views
                        of a quiet, unpublicized nature would be a great step forward. It would seem
                        clear from this that <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName>, at
                        least, rather expected that <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>
                        would go back with some startling new proposals in some form or other
                        following his consultations here.</p>
                    <p>The subject of any meeting between <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and the President was not raised by <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> at any time and I, of course, did
                        not do so.</p>

                    <p>You will recall our discussion on February 21, concerning the prohibition
                        against the importation of Soviet crab meat.<note n="2" xml:id="d37fn2">Presumably at the meeting during which the President's February 22

                            pp. 5-6.</note> It is my recommendation that the ban against imported

                    <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0115"/>
                    <p>We believe that it is of great importance at this juncture to take some
                        action which would further our objectives of developing the channels of
                        communication with the Soviets. Removal of the ban on the importation of
                        Soviet crab meat would be a tangible demonstration of our desire to improve
                        United States-Soviet relations. It would remove a barrier to United
                        States-Soviet trade which Soviet leaders apparently regard as particularly
                        discriminatory and which was imposed at a time of considerable political
                        tension.</p>
                    <p>The ban on the importation of Soviet crab meat was imposed at the time of the
                        Korean War in 1951 by the Department of the Treasury in conformity with the
                        provisions of Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, on the basis of its
                        finding that Soviet crab meat was produced by convict, forced and indentured
                        labor. The finding was based on eye-witness affidavits, mostly from former
                        Japanese prisoners of war, regarding the employment in Soviet crab meat
                        canning and crab fishing of Japanese prisoners of war, Japanese civilians
                        trapped in areas occupied by Soviet forces at the end of World War II,
                        Korean civilians, and Russian convict labor.</p>
                    <p>In the last few years various Soviet officials have denied that slave or
                        convict labor conditions exist in the Soviet crab meat industry. These
                        include Soviet Deputy Premier <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>
                        and Deputy Foreign Trade Minister Kuzmin. Other information which has come
                        to the attention of the Departments of State and Treasury bears this out. In
                        the Department's opinion these statements should be sufficient, in the
                        absence of any recent evidence to the contrary, to justify a lifting of the
                        crab meat prohibition. It is our understanding that the Department of the
                        Treasury is also convinced of the justification for removing the
                        prohibition.</p>
                    <p>Under these circumstances, I am convinced that a lifting of the crab meat ban
                        at this time would be in the national interest.</p>

                    <p>On February 27, 1961, Walter J. Stoessel, Director of the Executive
                        Secretariat of the Department of State, sent to the White House for
                        clearance the drafts of four telegrams to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>. The four cables <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0116"/>were approved the following day and
                        transmitted to Moscow late on February 28. In the first, telegram 1401, the
                        Department of State reiterated the points that Bohlen had made to Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> on February 14
                        concerning expansion of trade between the United States and the Soviet
                        Union. (Department of State, Central Files, 411.6141/2-2861) Telegram 1402
                        outlined the U.S. position on Germany and Berlin, stating that the “central
                        difficulty is of course continued division of Germany” and that the “United
                        States continues to believe that there will be no real settlement of this
                        problem or any real tranquillity in Central Europe until Germans were
                        permitted to unite themselves. This will remain our constant aim and we
                        would not be disposed to take any legal or other definitive steps which
                        would appear to perpetuate or legalize this division.” For text of telegram

                        State, Central Files, 770G.00/ 2-2861) The final telegram, 1404, instructed
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> to inform <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that the President intended to
                        make a vigorous effort to reach an agreement on the cessation of nuclear
                        testing. (Ibid., 397.5611-GE/2-2861)</p>
                    <p>Following the despatch of these telegrams, the Department of State sent
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> two additional
                        cables, 1405 and 1406, drafted on February 28. In the first <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> was authorized to deliver the
                        President's message (see <ref target="frus1961-63v06">

                        circumstances warranted, although the Department preferred delivery to

                        Central Files, 600.0012/2-2861) The second elaborated on the President's

                    <p>On March 2 following a discussion of how to proceed on disarmament, <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> reported that he had explored

                        aspects Sovbloc air activities.</p>
                    <p>Department appreciates problem of apparent discrepancy in having US suggest
                        to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> commencement bilateral air
                        transport negotiations and US attitude in <gloss target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss> on Sovbloc operations into Middle East and Cuba. Your
                        reply to the effect that key factor was that of areas which Communists
                        seeking penetrate is quite right. Sovbloc air service penetration of Near
                        East is accomplished fact and US would seek keep extension of penetration to
                        manageable proportions and in framework orderly development international
                        civil aviation. In particular problem of keeping <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> members like Poland and Czechoslovakia out of such areas
                        realized. Czecho now flies to the Far East by way of Near East, South, and
                        Southeast Asia. Likewise Czecho flies deep into Africa.</p>
                    <p>As to Latin America, the United States wants make serious effort keep all
                        Sovbloc airlines out of area. In particular we can not tolerate their using
                        United States Air Force Bases abroad or civil airports in the United States
                        for purpose carrying out these operations. It is quite clear basic purpose
                        such operations is political and not commercial and therefore not consistent
                        with Chicago Convention<note n="3" xml:id="d39fn3">For text of the Chicago
                            Convention on International Civil Aviation, December 7, 1944, see 61
                            Stat. 1180.</note> which specifically prohibits misuse civil aviation
                        for other purposes. Would be inconceivable think of Czechoslovak airline
                        having flown to Cuba under any regime before Castro. Such service just would
                        not make economic sense.</p>
                    <p>As far as Soviet service Iceland is concerned, except for the presence of US
                        defense forces at Keflavik, situation would be similar other Western
                        European countries to which Sovbloc airlines now fly. However, the military
                        operations at Keflavik do provide additional element. The US <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0118"/>would hope, for that reason, and in view
                        common <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> interest those military
                        operations, that any rights given by Iceland would eliminate the possibility
                        of 1. having Soviet personnel stationed at Keflavik, 2. having direct rapid
                        electrical communication between Keflavik and Moscow. In addition, if either
                        traffic or transit rights are granted in Iceland, for general political
                        reasons, the US would also hope that rights would terminate at Keflavik or,
                        if they went beyond, would not be granted until terminal rights had been
                        granted by other non-sensitive countries and that such rights be carefully
                        restricted only to specified terminal points. This for purpose preventing
                        Soviet long-range aircraft flying from Keflavik to Latin America.</p>
                    <p>US desires conclude satisfactory air transport agreement with USSR because it
                        feels that, in view of services between Moscow and most European capitals,
                        it is logical for Moscow have such connections with New York. We realize
                        dangers and problems involved and are making every effort avoid such dangers
                        and minimize problems.<note n="4" xml:id="d39fn4">At this point in the
                            source text the following sentence was deleted before transmission: “The
                            draft agreement which US is putting together will be a tough one which
                            Soviet Union will have difficulty accepting.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is not intention of the United States to in any way urge any country which
                        must provide overflight rights or intermediate landing rights for Aeroflot
                        in connection with an eventual US/<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        agreement to do so only in framework of the common policy i.e. to exact from
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> adequate reciprocal rights.</p>
                    <p>Your statement contained Topol 1059 that US would not let Soviet airline fly
                        Moscow-New York-Havana is completely correct. US will make sure there is no
                        possibility of rights beyond New York and for that reason will not request
                        rights beyond Moscow. Also, intermediate points will be carefully spelled
                        out so that sensitive points like Havana could not be used as an
                        intermediate point.</p>
                    <p>Dept agrees with other points raised by you as needing clarification for
                        example your point number 1. that air transport agreement should be drafted
                        so as permit consultation with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members
                        before establishing air routes which will in effect call for intermediate
                        stops whether traffic or non-traffic in territory other members or fanning
                        out “points beyond” rights to areas which now are or in the future might be
                        sensitive is an excellent one. As matter of fact we interpret 1958 common
                        policy as requiring such consultation and were therefore disturbed to see
                        the United Kingdom had revised its agreement with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> so as make intermediate points unlimited, without
                        consultations with the US or other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        members. It is true that airlines of member countries may wish seek maximum
                        air services. However in any agreement with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Aeroflot is bound get at least equal rights in a market
                        which can not possibly <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0119"/>be of more
                        than limited value for some time to come. For that reason political aspects
                        appear over-riding. We are also aware that a number of countries are not
                        really interested in reciprocal services and will not insist on operating
                        them at the same time that the Soviets begin service. Presumably such soft
                        attitude results from the desire to trade with bloc or other interest not
                        particularly related to civil aviation.</p>
                    <p>Your second point, to effect that transit right problem complicated not only
                        by Two Freedoms Agreement<note n="5" xml:id="d39fn5">Presumably a reference
                            to the International Air Services Transit Agreement, December 7, 1944
                            (59 Stat. 1693).</note> but by difficulty justifying refusal transit
                        rights in light relations not only with communists but with other states,
                        presumably refers to fact that state granting terminal right might be irked
                        if it could not exercise its reciprocal rights if another member country
                        denied essential transit rights. However US feels that countries granting
                        such rights should take a hardheaded attitude towards Soviet Union and we
                        have, for example, once again informed Sweden we would not any way expect
                        that country grant overflight or technical transit or traffic rights to USSR
                        for purpose flying to New York, without exacting from <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> adequate reciprocal benefit. We would
                        take same attitude toward other countries as well.</p>
                    <p>It is hoped that above will be some help. Actually you have done excellent
                        job of carrying the ball this difficult subject and Department will attempt
                        keep you continuously informed on developments so you may always be prepared

                    <p>On March 8, 1961, <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">John McCloy</persName>,
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s Adviser on
                        Disarmament, forwarded a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> in which
                        he contended that it was “in the overall interest of the national security
                        of the United States to make a renewed and vigorous attempt to negotiate a
                        test ban agreement along the lines now contemplated.” Such an agreement,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> stated, “would be a
                        significant step in the field of arms control” and “might well contribute to
                        better and more stable relations between <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0120"/>the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.” It could also “be helpful in
                        preventing the spread of nuclear weapons capabilities among other
                        countries.” Finally, a workable test ban agreement would “gain credit for
                        the United States in responsible world opinion,” whereas “the damage to the
                        stature of the U.S. in world affairs and the effect on U.S.-U.S.S.R.
                        relations which might result if the U.S. were to fail to take reasonable
                        steps necessary to reach a satisfactory test ban agreement, and then resume
                        testing, would be serious.” For text of the memorandum, see <ref target="frus1961-63v07">

                        Novosibirsk for talks lasting nearly three hours.</p>
                    <p>I began by giving him President's letter<note n="2" xml:id="d41fn2">For text,

                        thank President for his message and said they appreciated and agreed with
                        spirit of letter; it could serve as good beginning. He asked me convey his
                        gratitude and good wishes to President and added he refrained from
                        traditional wish of long life for President because he being so young did
                        not need such wishes.</p>
                    <p>I explained <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> would be in

                        President had in mind first week in May and was thinking of either Vienna or
                        Stockholm as convenient place to meet.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied would be necessary
                        work out reason for meeting. He seemed inclined prefer Vienna but did not
                        rule out Stockholm and thought sometime during first ten days May be

                        in order avoid flying twice over Atlantic. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he knew well transatlantic flights. I said

                        study President's letter but he inclined agree with proposal and thought
                        would be useful become acquainted with President. He said he had pleasure of
                        meeting President when he member Senate Foreign Relations Committee but had
                        exchanged only few words with him.</p>
                    <p>Later at luncheon <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he
                        hoped it would become possible to issue invitation for President visit
                        Soviet Union. He said they would receive him with all their traditional
                        hospitality; they would like welcome him and his family and show him their

                    <p>Telegram 2146 is printed as <ref target="#d43">Document 43</ref>. In telegram
                        2147 <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> reported that,
                        regarding Germany and Berlin, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        “did not want to change anything in Germany, but to fix juridically what had
                        happened after the war. He said to leave the situation as is would cause
                        instability and encourage German revanchists.” <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> commented further that “to conceive of unified
                        Germany under either <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> or
                            <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> would be unrealistic.”
                        Therefore “let us conclude a treaty with two Germanies; we are ready to
                        stipulate with US a provision of whatever is necessary for people of West
                        Berlin to have political system of their own choice.” For text of telegram

                        with President was motivated by need for explanation to ChiComs.<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2">See paragraph 3, <ref target="#d41">Document

                        what kind statement would be made to press. He thought my remark to him that
                        meeting would be presented simply as opportunity two statesmen get
                        acquainted and review problems of mutual interest would cover matter but
                        pointed out this was not fully made clear in letter.</p>

                        problems discussed.</p>
                    <p>He appeared extremely tired and his appearance shocked even Soviets who
                        accompanied me. He said he was leaving today for Aklominsk and would go from
                        there to Alma Ata returning Moscow about March 23 or 24. When I inquired
                        when party program for October Congress would be published he replied in
                        August or possibly earlier. He said he planned go Central Asia in early
                        April for rest and work on program. He pointed out too early go Black Sea.
                        He took pills during lunch and drank only small amount red wine. During
                        lunch in addition usual toast to President, etc. he remarked President had
                        asked him use diplomatic channel and he wished propose toast to this method
                        getting some results.</p>

                        been reviewing restrictions on import of Soviet crabmeat and hoped be able
                        lift them. I said I realized this would be small step but I believed it was
                        in right direction. I said we did not want to say anything publicly for
                            present.<note n="2" xml:id="d43fn2">On March 20 the Department of the

                        this would be good move. He said we must normalize our relations and that it
                        is difficult to explain why <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has little
                        commerce with US when it trades with other Western powers. He brought up
                        recent cancellation of grinding machines and said <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> can fly its rockets without US machines. (On return trip
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> told me <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hammer</persName>

                        had told <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> they would soon
                        receive good news about an export license without specifying what it was
                        for. Soviets had assumed it was for grinding machines and had therefore been
                        particularly surprised at cancellation.) I gave <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> confidential explanation this transaction and
                        little lecture on how American Govt operates. I told him I had discussed
                        with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName> importance of
                        maintaining license once it had been issued and that he had agreed this was
                        important.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> expressed opinion that
                        small minority in US is blinded by hatred for <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and expressed regret because their attitude does not
                        create conditions for trust. He also raised question of purchase of urea
                        factories and said if US would sell them <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> ready to buy them. He said <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had already purchased three from Netherlands. He said
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had lived 200 years without such
                        factories and could live a few years more. Later at luncheon he said <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> does not compete with US in trade field
                        and could be very good consumer of its goods. If we had different trade
                        relations, he said, they would not have been developing some branches of
                        their industry and instead would be buying from us.</p>

                    <p>G-665. The following miscellaneous items supplement reports on my recent
                        conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Most of
                        these points arose during informal luncheon conversation.</p>
                    <p>(1) During luncheon I mentioned to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that one area for cooperation between the US and
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be Outer Space. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that he agreed, but he
                        did not pursue the subject.</p>
                    <p>(2) <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he had
                        received many letters from statesmen abroad and that these emphasized that
                        much depended upon Soviet relations with the US.</p>
                    <p>(3) <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> recalled his recent
                        conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hammer</persName> and
                        repeated much of what the Embassy has already reported; namely, that
                            <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hammer</persName> was the first foreign
                        concessionaire in the Soviet Union, that when <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hammer</persName> was in Rostov both <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> and Voroshilov <note n="2" xml:id="d44fn2"> Kliment
                            Y. Voroshilov, Marshal of the Soviet Union and member of the Presidium
                            of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet
                            Union.</note> were there, that <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hammer</persName> was able to visit the pencil factory that he had
                        organized in Moscow. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        seemed much impressed by <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hammer</persName> and
                        recalled he had been told that <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hammer</persName>
                        had earned nearly $1 million at the same time that he was attending college.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> also repeated what he
                        had told <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hammer</persName> about the Soviet
                        process of making synthetic rubber directly from gas. He referred with pride
                        to fact that <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hammer</persName>'s nephew had
                        recently visited U.S. and had been urged to stay but had preferred return to
                        Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>(4) When I mentioned to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> at
                        luncheon that there were few important direct problems between the US and
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, that our differences lay outside
                        bilateral relations, he readily assented.</p>
                    <p>(5) During our discussion of Germany, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to illustrate what little importance West Berlin
                        has for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> said that the annual
                        Soviet population increase is 3.5 million and that the total population of
                        West Berlin is 2 million— “one night's work.”</p>
                    <p>(6) In talking about Soviet desire to purchase urea plants, Khrushchev said
                        that Garst <note n="3" xml:id="d44fn3">Presumably this is reference to
                            Roswell Garst whose farm in Coons Rapids, Iowa, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> visited in 1959 during his
                            trip to the United States.</note> had advised him to procure such
                        plants.</p>
                    <p>(7) During our discussion on disarmament, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> interjected the remark that Stevenson in the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> seemed to go astray like Lodge.<note n="4" xml:id="d44fn4"> Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., former U.S.
                            Representative to the United Nations.</note> He <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0125"/>then inquired what Lodge was doing at the
                        present time. I told him I understood Lodge was connected with an
                        international educational foundation.</p>
                    <p>(8) <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> spoke with great
                        conviction of the need to reform the United Nations set-up. He asserted that
                        the US had mis-used its voting majority but what did this prove? The day
                        might soon come when the majority would be against the US and we would then
                        understand the Soviet position. Great powers could not be made to do things
                        against their vital interests by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> votes.
                        The veto provision in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> charter had been
                        very wise and something must be done so that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretariat could not act in favor of one side. The only
                        solution he could find was his proposal for a three-man
                        Secretary-General.</p>
                    <p>(9) When I mentioned that President had many important domestic problems to
                        tackle <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> remarked that all
                        countries had their internal problems.</p>
                    <p>(10) <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> not only stated that
                        Soviet Union would overtake US in per capita industrial production by 1970
                        but added that later—presumably by end 20-year plan—their output per capita
                        would be double ours. He added, however, that we need have nothing to fear
                        from this. I observed that the Soviet Union would have to begin to devote
                        more of their resources and manpower to service industries. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> agreed and said they were far
                        behind us in this field.</p>
                    <p>(11) <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said his daughter Rada
                        had come out to join him two days before but she did not appear at lunch as
                        she was doing some work at the Novosibirsk Academy of Science. He mentioned

                    <p>G-666. Returning from my meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> at Novosibirsk I had a two-hour conversation with
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, head of the America
                        Section in the Foreign Office. I found this of considerable interest,
                        particularly in view of the fact that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> has served in the United States and is as friendly
                        toward us as any communist official I know. I began by expressing
                        discouragement at the prospect of reaching agreement with Soviet Union on
                        major issues in view of the wide disparity between the way the two countries
                        saw the same problem. I suggested there was a double distortion in the
                        Soviet view of these issues. In the first place they saw everything through
                        the prism of Marxism and secondly, I could not help but believe that they
                        did not get an objective picture of a given situation because of the
                        tendency which had existed for years of reporting facts which tended to
                        support Soviet positions. When <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asserted that they had excellent factual
                        information, I agreed this might be true but I was convinced they did not
                        understand what motivated western countries.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that from his
                        experience in the United States he thought we would fall behind the Soviet
                        Union in economic development because we lack a goal. The Soviet people have
                        the goal of overtaking the United States and are prepared to sacrifice and
                        work hard for this. In his opinion this was far more effective than in the
                        US where many people are satisfied with what they have and see no reason to
                        strain themselves to increase production. I agreed that there was something
                        in this thesis. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> went on to
                        observe that when the Soviets achieve their goal of overtaking us this would
                        have a major effect upon the standing of our two countries in the rest of
                        the world. He said the US was a rich country and therefore all less
                        developed countries looked to us for assistance and this gave us great
                        influence. In the future it would be the Soviet Union to which they would
                        turn.</p>
                    <p>Latin America having come up in this connection, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he thought we had made every possible mistake
                        in dealing with <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>'s Cuba.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> had made overtures toward
                        us which had been rejected, he had visited the US and had received what
                        amounted to a rebuff, and each move we made to punish him was met by a
                        counter-move on his part. I suggested that the opposite was true in that we
                        had been most patient and had finally broken relations when virtually forced
                        to do so by <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>. I referred also to
                        his dictatorial moves in dismissing most of the judiciary <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0127"/>and in arbitrarily executing hundreds of
                        honest Cubans. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that
                        bloodshed was of course deplorable. He pointed out that Lenin had wished to
                        avoid it in the Soviet Union but was obliged to resort to terror in order to
                        deal with counter-revolution.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> discussed the Laos situation
                        and our efforts to curtail the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agenda,
                        which I have already reported.<note n="2" xml:id="d45fn2">See <ref target="#d34">Document 34</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>In this connection I urged that at any time there was doubt about our
                        intentions or our policies, they should ask us frankly rather than guess. He
                        admitted that there were frequent misunderstandings. I pointed out that the
                        removal of such misunderstandings was one of the principal reasons for the
                        current approach to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Discussing the Congo, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he
                        thought our policy was influenced by our commercial interests there. I said
                        I was sure this was not the case and thought we had very little commercial
                        interest in that country. He mentioned diamond interests and oil companies.
                        I said that we had important interests in some of the newly-established
                        African countries but I thought that the Congo had been dominated
                        commercially by the Belgians and I was not aware of any important tie-up
                        with American industry. In any event I could assure him that there were no
                        commercial interests in a position to influence US policy decisions. (This
                        seems to me a good example of the Marxist slant which Soviets give to every
                        problem.)</p>
                    <p>I was struck by the extent to which <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> is convinced that the Soviet Union will achieve its
                        goals and that democratic capitalism is doomed.</p>
                    <p>In the course of the discussion <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked for my opinion of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName>. I did not consider it expedient
                        to answer this directly. I referred however to his intense activity in
                        buttonholing various American public figures and by other indirect remarks
                        indicated that I did not think he had been very successful. Later on I had
                        occasion to remark that the type of official who in my opinion would succeed
                        in the US was Kuznetsov. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        remarked “A number of us in the Foreign Ministry would agree with you.”</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> offered his
                        analysis of Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        thinking on Berlin in telegram 2209 to the Department of State, March 16,
                        1961. “All my diplomatic colleagues who have discussed matter appear to
                        consider that in absence negotiations <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will sign separate treaty with East Germany and
                        precipitate Berlin crisis this year. My own view is that while he would in
                        these circumstances almost certainly conclude separate treaty, he would
                        likely attempt avoid immediate crisis on Berlin by some method such as
                        instructing East Germans not to interfere with Allied access for given
                        period of time.” For text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v14">

                    <p>During the luncheon, the conversation was of a social nature.</p>
                    <p>Toward the end of the luncheon the Secretary rose to pronounce a toast. He
                        said that he had not had the pleasure of visiting the Soviet Union <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0129"/>although he had seen the harbor of
                        Leningrad when he was a young student. He had made several round trips
                        between London and Leningrad on a Soviet steamer but had not been allowed to
                        go ashore in Leningrad. This was the least expensive way to spend vacations
                        and everybody had a marvelous time. The Secretary said that it was well
                        known that the hospitality of the Soviet Government and the Soviet people
                        were unexcelled anywhere in the world. The Secretary expressed the hope that
                        during the luncheon, and also perhaps later, useful discussion could take
                        place with the assistance of aides as desired. He then welcomed Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to Washington. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, the Secretary said, was
                        at home in Washington because he had been Ambassador here at the time when
                        the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were working together
                        to achieve victory over the common enemy. The Secretary then raised his
                        glass to the development of friendship and of solidarity of interests
                        between the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, in reply to the toast,
                        said that he had indeed seen the US before and not only from a ship.
                        (Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> interjected
                        that this had been an exception.) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then said that the Soviet Union also desired a
                        constructive development of relations between the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and that he saw no other way to achieve
                        that objective than to sit down and discuss all the problems involved. He
                        then raised his glass to the strengthening and development of ties between
                        the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> so that later, perhaps
                        not in the distant future, the fruits of the labors could be seen; namely,
                        closer and friendlier relations between the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> said that he wanted to
                        add a postscript to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s
                        toast and recalled that in 1945 Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said in London that he wanted to be in a
                        position to raise a toast to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> when it
                        had teeth. Of course, in 1945 the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was in a
                        state of infancy, but now that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> does
                        have teeth, the Soviet Union doesn't seem to like it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that some teeth grew in the
                        wrong direction and caused pain.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then stated that before leaving the table he wanted to say that
                        the new Administration hoped very much that the relations between the Soviet
                        Union and the US could be improved on a serious and mutually advantageous
                        basis. The US realized that there were a number of serious problems between
                        the two Governments which should be thought about. Also, there were a number
                        of lesser questions which should not be too difficult to resolve, and which
                        were worth our attention. He said that what he had in mind was the fact that
                        certain individuals were being held, for various reasons, in the respective
                        countries. He noted that the US was gratified that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had released the RB-47 fliers. The
                        Secretary then expressed hope that progress could be achieved in several
                        other areas, such as conclusion of a civil air agreement, conclusion of a
                        consular agreement restoring consular activities in the two <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0130"/>countries, and in the field of exchanges
                        both on the technical level and of tourists. The Secretary remarked
                        facetiously that the US needed dollars and that therefore it hoped that the
                        Soviet Union would send many tourists, rich ones if possible. The Secretary
                        went on to say that he was of the opinion that the problems affecting
                        strictly bilateral relations between the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were by and large simple, and that the most difficult
                        problems were those that involved other countries. He reiterated his hope
                        that these bilateral problems could be resolved and that as a result of
                        that, improvement in mutual relations between the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be brought about. The Secretary
                        said that the US favored open exchange programs in the fields of science,
                        technology and scholarships, and that it was prepared to open negotiations
                        on the next exchange agreement, which are scheduled for October or November,
                        with bilateral informal discussions in the near future. The Secretary said
                        that some of these lesser problems may appear to have no more significance
                        than a thread in a web; however, one should realize that if these threads
                        were put together, this would lead to an improvement in US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations. The Secretary then said that
                        the Soviet people and the American people had a great deal in common. Both
                        were gay and friendly, and American visitors were impressed by Soviet
                        hospitality. As far as bilateral problems were concerned, the Secretary said
                        that one problem which was of symbolic significance was that of Soviet
                        exports of crabmeat. He said that he didn't know how much crabmeat the
                        Soviet Union could send to the US or how much crabmeat the American people
                        could eat, but he felt that solution of this problem would remove a minor
                        irritation in our mutual relations. He said that he hoped that we could
                        remove many such minor irritations. The Secretary then stated that the
                        President was very much interested in a constructive development of
                            US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations, and that as many
                        steps as possible be made in that direction.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that he
                        appreciated the Secretary's remarks and that he would like to say that the
                        Soviet Government, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        himself, attach great importance to US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        relations and that the Soviet Union believes that the significance of the
                        relations between the two countries does not diminish with the development
                        of the international situation but rather increases. Therefore, the Soviet
                        Government believes that the responsibility of the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for the international situation will
                        increase rather than diminish. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the Secretary was correct in saying that
                        there were different problems confronting the two countries. Some of them
                        were of lesser and some of major importance. However, the development of
                            US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations and of the world
                        situation depended on the solution of the major problems. There was no
                        question that the solution of the lesser problems would also influence
                            US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations and that, as the
                        Secretary had said, they could form a web of some significance for the
                        development of <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0131"/>those relations.
                        However, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> believes that the main
                        attention should be focused on the major problems. While lesser problems are
                        of certain significance, it is the solution of major problems that will
                        determine the development of US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        relations, the state of world affairs, and the question of whether there
                        will be war or peace. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        went on to say that there were several key problems before the US and the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. No one would deny that
                        disarmament was of paramount importance. It was a problem to which many
                        other questions were related and around which many other problems were
                        orbiting like sputniks. The second key question is Germany, particularly the
                        question of West Berlin which at the moment brooks no delay. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he did not know whether
                        the Secretary was prepared to discuss these questions in detail at this
                        time. He said that he would not insist on their being discussed now.
                        However, he did want to stress that these two problems were among the major
                        problems confronting the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                        perhaps they were the most important problems. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he wanted the Secretary,
                        the US Government, and the President to know that the Soviet Government
                        sincerely wants to facilitate the solution of the disarmament problem. The
                        Soviet Union is prepared to accept the most effective kind of controls over
                        disarmament. It was gratifying to see that all states had accepted the
                        principle of general and complete disarmament, but that principle should now
                        be implemented. In view of the considerations expressed by Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> in Moscow and by
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> in New York, the
                        Soviet Union does not insist on having a General Assembly debate on the
                        substance of disarmament. The substance of disarmament could be discussed at
                        a later date. He expressed hope that this willingness of the Soviet Union to
                        postpone substantive discussion of disarmament would be appreciated. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he believed
                        that the General Assembly should limit its discussion of disarmament to the
                        adoption of a general resolution on the principles of general and complete
                        disarmament so that the world could see that the major powers are devoting
                        their attention to that problem. Later, when the US was ready, the
                        composition of a smaller forum could be agreed for the purpose of resuming
                        substantive negotiations.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that he hoped that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> could work out these problems
                        with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in New York. The
                        Secretary said that he wanted to stress the seriousness with which the US
                        Government is approaching the problem of disarmament. The US Government is
                        very serious with regard to the negotiations on the discontinuance of
                        nuclear tests and hopes that an agreement can be obtained that will be in
                        the interest of all parties concerned and will not affect their security. As
                        far as general disarmament is concerned, the Secretary said that he wanted
                        to be frank on this subject. The American people have never been against
                        disarmament, if given a chance. After World War II <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0132"/>the US demobilized very quickly so that in
                        1946 there was not a single division or Air Force group ready for combat. If
                        our military budget today is four times larger than the one we had in 1946,
                        it is because of the events that have occurred since World War II. The fact
                        is that democracy never likes to bear the burden of armaments in peace-time.
                        The Secretary then observed that the US was now studying intensively the
                        general question of armaments and hoped to be able to exchange views with
                        the Soviet Union on that subject before formal negotiations resumed in a
                        forum that might be established. In this area, much depends on the
                        confidence in the national purposes of nations engaging in such commitments.
                        The American people would welcome it if a basis could be found for arms
                        reduction and if certain political problems were resolved and disappeared
                        from the world scene.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that he believed
                        that the point had been reached where not only the arms race should be
                        stopped, but disarmament should begin as well. The Soviet Union believes
                        that the peoples of the world realize the heavy burden of arms and the need
                        for disarmament. No wise man can be found who could say where the line
                        should be drawn beyond which no one should go. The Soviet Union believes
                        that all problems, including that of armaments, are created by man, and that
                        man can resolve them. The Soviet Union is not fatalistic in this respect. It
                        believes that the question of disarmament, including agreement between the
                        US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, can be resolved. As to the
                        question of nuclear tests, the Soviet Union has made very many concessions
                        but has not seen a similar attitude on the part of its negotiating partners.
                        Frankly speaking, the Soviet Government has gained the impression that its
                        negotiating partners have been trying to be shrewd and to obtain an
                        agreement that would be detrimental to Soviet interests. As the US knows,
                        the Soviet Union has not been testing. Furthermore, there are instruments
                        today which can detect any nuclear explosion in the world. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he did not know whether
                        the Secretary wanted to discuss the details of this particular problem. For
                        his part, he did not insist on such a discussion but would be prepared to
                        discuss these questions if the Secretary desired. In any event, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said, one should realize
                        that if there should be no agreement, the Soviet Union would not be the only
                        one to stand a loss. Such a development would harm everyone and, most of
                        all, peace and the world situation at large. With regard to strictly
                        bilateral US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations, the Soviet
                        Government, in so far as this depends on it, will make every effort to
                        improve them. The Soviet Government believes that the possibilities for such
                        improvement are inexhaustible. Political, economic, cultural and other
                        relations could be improved. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then recalled the conversations Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had had with American business
                        groups while in the US in 1959. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> also had similar conversations with former
                        President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>. <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0133"/>The impression gained at that time was that
                        certain US groups believed that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        would suffer a loss if economic relations between the two countries did not
                        develop. This, however, is not correct; rather, the reverse may be true
                        since the Soviet Union, in the absence of trade with the US, has developed
                        certain branches of industry which would not have been developed had that
                        trade existed. Nevertheless, the Soviet Union is still willing to develop
                        economic relations if the other side is willing to do the same. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he mentioned
                        the question of economic relations only in passing and only for the purpose
                        of giving a well-rounded picture of US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        relations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> went on to say
                        that the Soviet Government did not fail to note that the President and the
                        new Administration had made certain indications of their interest in
                        improving US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations. This interest
                        was evident in particular from the President's message to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, the <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> discussion, today's discussion, and also the
                        talks with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> on
                        disarmament. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then said
                        that on behalf of the Soviet Government he could say that any similar steps
                        on the part of the US Government and the President personally would not only
                        be welcomed and understood by the Soviet Government, but would also meet
                        with the Soviet Government's readiness to accept them. The Soviet Government
                        is not only willing to meet such steps half-way, but is also, as before,
                        proceeding in the direction of improving US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations. The Soviet Government is ready to take every
                        step in that direction that depends on it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that, in all frankness, the Soviet Government
                        and the Soviet people had been greatly displeased (at this point Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that perhaps the
                        w</p>
                    <p>The Secretary observed that he believed the climate was now such as would
                        make it possible to find out whether progress on the international scene
                        could be made. The US Government and the American people are ready to take
                        constructive steps. This should be done against the background of the
                        national purposes of the various countries. The problem is not only of what
                        we believe, but also what we do about what we believe. He then said that he
                        did not see any reason why the two governments could not find constructive
                        solutions of problems standing between our two countries and elsewhere in
                        the world. The US is under no illusion that these problems are simple;
                        obviously hard work will have to be done to resolve the details of these
                        problems and to limit their scope. However, the US, for its part, is willing
                        to do everything in order to bring about <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0134"/>more constructive relations between the two countries.
                        Obviously there are basic differences underlying our relations. As Mr.

                        not convert the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, nor could the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> convert the US. However, in the final
                        analysis, we do not believe that the problems we are confronting are
                        insuperable. We are devoted to peace and to constructive relations and we
                        are prepared to work as prudently as possible to resolve the problems that
                        divide our two countries now or may divide them in the future. Of course,
                        the interests of many other governments and the attitudes of many other
                        peoples are also involved in the situation and neither the US nor the Soviet
                        Union can be indifferent to these interests or attitudes. Yet, if both sides
                        are willing to tackle the problems constructively, they could be resolved.
                        We believe that neither side is interested in creating a crisis. The most
                        important objective is to maintain peace. So both sides should see what can
                        be done to avoid difficulties and to resolve the problems which by frank
                        discussion and statesmanship can be eliminated from our scene.</p>

                        debate to establishing directive on general principles. I said certain we
                        were not going to get ourselves bound to principle one treaty on general and
                        complete disarmament and pointed out they had even exploited <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution to limit debate in previous
                        meetings. On forum I said we were beginning to think no point in making
                        concessions to Soviet point of view. We had reluctantly agreed to parity on
                        disarmament committee and now they were pressing for their thesis of a three
                        bloc world. I said even neutrals opposed to this and we considered committee
                        already too large.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> said they were trying to be
                        considerate of our position to give us time work out policies but pointed
                        out we had many experts already familiar with problem. I replied that in
                        previous meetings and in Pugwash discussion appeared to us they had not
                        seriously studied disarmament problem. Each time we were about to come to
                        grips with real substance they broke up meeting and walked out. I emphasized
                        strongly seriousness with which we approaching problem but said this
                        involved questions which were vital to our survival and no attempt of theirs
                        to manipulate public opinion would cause us to jeopardize our security. If
                        they wanted to exploit this situation they could do so but this would not
                        advance cause of disarmament. <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> expressed suspicion we were merely stalling in
                        order build up our armaments. He referred to increases in US military
                        budget. He also referred number of times during our conversation to
                        statements made by President and others about Eastern Europe and
                        particularly <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>' speech at

                        was seriously studying meaning this phrase and others used by American
                        statesmen. I replied sentence he had quoted did not appear in summary which
                        I had received and basic thesis <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>' speech was endeavor find accommodation between us. I
                        also pointed out that after Declaration 81 parties and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s Jan 6 speech they could
                        scarcely expect us not to reply. They had expressed readiness support
                        so-called wars of liberation. In contrast I cited restraint we had shown
                        during Hungarian affair. Would have been easy for us at that time to have
                        stirred up Poles and East Germans but we had no desire use force or cause
                        useless waste of lives. I said this in sharp contrast to their policy of
                        stirring up trouble wherever they could. When he tried to slide over
                        Communist parties statement I said declaration that US was enemy of peoples
                        of world had made deep impression in US. He tried contend this referred only
                        to certain <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0136"/>circles but I suggested
                        he re-read statement. I said we could never take actions condoning regimes
                        in Eastern Europe unless and until they were supported by people but this
                        did not mean we were going to take any action overthrow them.</p>
                    <p>I raised lend-lease question but got no reaction except his complaint that we
                        were refusing sell them tractors which they could not understand.</p>

                    <p>1457. Joint State-<gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>. According press
                        reports from Moscow, Soviets have lifted censorship on despatches filed from
                        Moscow by foreign correspondents. Dept has issued statement welcoming move
                        as step towards removal barriers to free flow information and expressing
                        hope it will be followed by removal bars to flow of information into <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> (principal bars are selective jamming
                        foreign broadcasts in Soviet languages and non-availability to general
                        Soviet public of representative non-Communist foreign periodicals and
                        publications).</p>
                    <p>In commenting upon this action, US officials and output should take primary
                        guidance from Dept statement (carried in Wireless File). Officials should
                        avoid giving impression we do not regard lifting censorship as welcome
                        advance, should stress hope this step will eventually be followed by removal
                        or attenuation present severe controls on material from outside world
                        available Soviet people and should draw upon following background points in
                        order put move in context.</p>
                    <p>1. Censorship of foreign correspondents' despatches was no longer effective
                        bar to transmission censorable information to outside <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0137"/>world, since present relatively heavy flow
                        foreign visitors ensures many such items in any case become known outside
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> within a few days.</p>
                    <p>2. Consequently existence of censorship apparatus served only as propaganda
                        liability, in removing which Soviets now able create impression further
                        “liberalization”.</p>
                    <p>3. Ultimate sanction against foreign correspondents who seriously offend
                        regime or consistently transmit critical material remains, i.e., Soviet
                        ability either expel them from country or, in less urgent cases, refuse
                        allow them re-enter once they have left <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on leave. (Since 1945, according Dept records, six
                        American correspondents expelled from <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>;
                        nine refused visas.)</p>
                    <p>4. Removal censorship thus reinforces compulsion upon responsible
                        correspondent whose duty to his employer requires him strive maintain
                        representation in Moscow, to exercise self-censorship and avoid offending
                        Soviet Government to point at which it would expel him or refuse let him
                        re-enter. While censorship in operation correspondent could have some
                        assurance it would excise material Soviet Government might regard with
                        disfavor. Correspondent must now be his own judge in questionable cases.</p>
                    <p>5. Censorship has been lifted on outgoing material but situation unaltered
                        with regard material available to Soviet people: latter continues be as
                        tightly controlled as ever by Soviet Government. Most serious controls
                        exercised through continued selective jamming foreign radio broadcasts in
                        Russian (about 30-35% jammed out) and other Soviet languages (a high
                        percentage of which jammed out) and through fact non-Soviet-bloc periodicals
                        and publications (except for Communist Party literature) not available for
                        purchase by Soviet citizens and can be read in libraries only by those who
                        have political clearance. As facts warrant also useful cite situations
                        elsewhere particularly in your host country, which emphasize general
                        accessibility variety of foreign press, radio, television, motion-picture
                        materials, in contrast with thoroughly controlled flow such materials to
                        Soviet citizens.</p>

                        <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SVM1">Sukhodrev</persName>, Interpreter,
                            U.S.S.R. Ministry of Foreign Affairs</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The President opened the conversation by expressing his pleasure in meeting
                        the Foreign Minister and talking with him about matters of mutual
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> thanked the President for
                        this opportunity to meet him and said that he wanted to convey to the
                        President greetings and best wishes from the head of the Soviet Government,
                        N.S. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The President thanked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stated that the Soviet
                        Government knew that the President was very much interested in the Laotian
                        question. It was also familiar with the position of the U.S. Government and
                        the President personally, as expressed in the President's statement, the
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> discussion, and the conversation
                        between Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. Therefore, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said, he wished to set forth the
                        views of the Soviet Government, and of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> personally, on the Laotian problem. The Soviet
                        Government had recently received the U.K. proposal on Laos,<note n="2" xml:id="d50fn2">For text of the British proposal on Laos, March 23, see
                                <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,
                                1961</hi>, pp. 994-995.</note> which was in reply to the proposal of
                        the Soviet Government on the same question, communicated previously to the
                        U.K. Government. The U.K. proposal, as far as the Soviet Government was
                        aware, also reflects the U.S. Government's views.</p>
                    <p>The President confirmed this statement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued by saying that
                        the U.K. proposal was being thoroughly studied by the Soviet Government and
                        that the latter would reply to these proposals very shortly. However, even
                        now the Soviet <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0139"/>Government believes
                        that that proposal could serve as a basis for settlement in Laos, a
                        settlement that would ensure peaceful development for the Laotian people and
                        a policy of true neutrality for that country. Now that real ways for a
                        settlement of the Laotian question are in prospect, it is necessary to
                        manifest patience and restraint and not to do anything that might complicate
                        that problem. The U.S. and the U.S.S.R., as great powers, undoubtedly can
                        and must exert positive influence in the settling of the Laotian question by
                        peaceful means, and undoubtedly can and must take steps to prevent the
                        conflict from spreading. As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had said in his conversation with Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> and as he, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, had said to Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, the policy of the Soviet
                        Government with regard to the Laotian question is to strive for a truly
                        independent and truly neutral Laos. If the U.S. Government is also for a
                        truly independent and truly neutral Laos, as the Soviet Government is,
                        possibilities exist for settling the Laotian question to the satisfaction of
                        the U.S., the U.S.S.R. and all parties concerned. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that these were the views he
                        had been entrusted to convey to the President personally and to stress their
                        significance.</p>
                    <p>The President said he appreciated Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s remarks and expressed hope that this conversation
                        and the Soviet reply to the U.K. proposal would lead to a peaceful
                        settlement of the Laotian question. This is what we want. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> probably understands that the U.S.,
                        as a great power, would be concerned if Laos were taken over by forces
                        hostile to it just as the Soviet Union would probably be concerned if forces
                        hostile to it took over that country. Therefore, it is important to
                        stabilize the situation and prevent its further deterioration. It is for
                        this reason that the U.S. stresses the importance of a cease-fire. The U.S.
                        is concerned that, in the absence of a cease-fire, military activities will
                        continue while the conference is deliberating what form the future Laotian
                        Government should take. Both sides would put in more and more military
                        supplies, which would make the situation all the more difficult. Therefore,
                        the President said, he hoped that the U.K. proposal for a cease-fire would
                        be accepted; what is needed is not only the conference but also a
                        cease-fire. The President then said that he had read the recent Pravda
                        article on the Laotian question and that the article indicated that there
                        might be some ground for understanding. However, a cease-fire is important
                        because, in its absence, Soviet supplies would continue and our supplies
                        would continue, and that would create a more and more intense military
                        situation. Consequently, both sides should do commonly everything to ease
                        the situation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he could
                        reaffirm that, after familiarizing itself with the U.K. proposal, the Soviet
                        Government believed that there was a possibility for settling the Laotian
                        question and that a reply to that proposal would be forthcoming in a short
                        while. He said that he wanted <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0140"/>to
                        note that the fact that the U.S. Government had agreed to the convening of
                        an international conference and the international control commission was a
                        positive step. He recalled that when Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had told him about this he had told the Secretary that
                        this was a positive step in the proper direction and that it eased the
                        situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> observed that
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s statement had been
                        made at the end of their 3-hour long conversation.</p>
                    <p>The President remarked jocularly that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was a very persuasive man. He then inquired when, in
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s judgment, the Soviet
                        reply could be expected, and particularly whether it would be forthcoming
                        this week.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that he could give
                        no fixed date but said that it would be in “the nearest future”.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that the situation was inflammatory and that he was
                        anxious to have the Soviet reply as soon as possible. The sooner an
                        understanding was reached, the better off we would be. The military
                        situation would be behind us and efforts to discuss a settlement could
                        begin. He reiterated his concern that the situation might deteriorate and
                        its military aspects might become more intense.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he wished to
                        reiterate and stress again that it was very important not to do anything
                        that would further complicate the situation. It is particularly important
                        that the U.S. and U.S.S.R. use their influence and prestige so that no
                        action is taken that would complicate the situation and spread the
                        conflict.</p>
                    <p>The President agreed and emphasized once again that if both sides could come
                        to an understanding, they should do so without delay so as not to expand the
                        conflict but rather diminish it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that it was good if
                        the U.S. was taking steps to prevent the situation from deteriorating and to
                        create a more favorable situation in Laos and around it.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that everything should be done to prevent the conflict
                        from escalating and reiterated that the sooner this was done the better off
                        both sides would be. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        observed that it was very good if the U.S. Government was acting in the
                        direction of facilitating the solution of the Laotian problem. He then said
                        that he wanted to ask a specific question relating to the Laotian problem, a
                        question which he had mentioned to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>'s
                        and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>'s presence. The
                        question was that of the presence of <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName>'s troops in Laos. The Soviet Government had
                        expressed hope that those troops, numbering about 3,000, would be disarmed
                        and withdrawn. Unfortunately, to the Soviet Government's great regret,
                        according to information available to the Soviet Government, no such steps
                        had been taken so far. He said that this was a specific <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0141"/>question within the general scope of the
                        Laotian problem, but that he still wanted to mention it.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that the U.S. also believed that those troops should
                        not be there. He recalled that the troops had come from Burma and that when
                        this question had come up, the U.S. had made strong overtures to <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> in order to persuade him to
                        withdraw those troops. The President then turned to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> and asked whether there was any
                        recent information on this subject.</p>
                    <p>The Acting Secretary said that as of a week ago 1,500, or more than one-half
                        of the troops in question had been withdrawn and that the movement was
                        continuing.</p>
                    <p>The President then reiterated that the U.S. shared the view that there was no
                        reason for those troops to be in Laos. They were an incendiary factor and
                        should be removed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> observed that this was a
                        favorable development and said that the sooner those troops were removed,
                        the better. Their withdrawal would facilitate the settlement of the Laotian
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then turned to the general
                        question of US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations. He recalled
                        that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had expressed the
                        U.S. Government's views concerning the development of US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations and the Secretary's statement
                        that the President and the U.S. Government were willing to take steps to
                        improve these relations. In particular, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had mentioned the possibility of bilateral exchanges of
                        views on certain problems in order to develop US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations. This, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said, was in accord with the desires of the Soviet
                        Government, and he wanted to assure the President that the Soviet Government
                        had always striven and would continue to strive for the development of
                            US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations. It would be well if
                        some day the point was reached where genuine friendship were established
                        between the two countries. Then both the American and the Soviet peoples
                        could reap the fruits of improved relations.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that he shared this view and that he hoped that
                            US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations could be developed.
                        The problem was that of different national interests in some areas, such as
                        Laos and certain other areas. What is necessary is to create an atmosphere
                        where these problems could be settled without approaching the brink of a
                        military situation. The President said that it was important to realize that
                        differences existed in the systems and the national policies of the two
                        countries, but that it was equally important to create an atmosphere where
                        these differences could be settled without moves and countermoves by each of
                        the two sides, and where neither side would have to take a strong stand. The
                        areas where such settlements are necessary are particularly Laos, Africa and
                        Cuba.</p>
                    <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0142"/>
                    <p>Therefore, the President said, he was glad to have had this opportunity to
                        discuss the Laotian question with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. It was important to bring about solutions of these
                        problems with due regard to the interests of the two countries and without
                        embarrassing their respective positions or bringing us to the brink of
                        disaster.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the President's
                        remarks were of great interest and that the Soviet Government believed the
                        U.S. and the U.S.S.R., as the two greatest powers, possessing the greatest
                        military potential, should in their relations do nothing that might bring us
                        to the brink or to the point of a choice between war and peace. Problems
                        where possibility for settlement exist must be settled peacefully with due
                        regard to the interests of the two countries and of the interests of other
                        states, if such interests are involved. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then stated that as Foreign Minister of the
                        U.S.S.R., he considered that this attitude was a proper one and that neither
                        side should do anything that might bring them to the brink. He observed that
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> surely shared
                        his view.</p>
                    <p>Responding to the President's invitation to make his observations, Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> referred to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s statement in which he
                        urged that no steps should be taken that would aggravate the situation in
                        Laos. He said that he assumed that this also applied to the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he had stated
                        earlier that both the Soviet Union and the U.S. should do nothing that might
                        complicate the situation in Laos, around Laos, and around the Laotian
                        question.</p>
                    <p>[The President then invited Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to join him for a private talk on the lawn. The
                        President reported that in the course of that conversation, he had
                        reiterated the urgent need for preventing the Laotian situation from coming
                        to a brink. Recalling the 1914 situation, he said that we should avoid a
                        development where both sides would be moving in. He also said that the
                        Soviet Government should not attempt to push the U.S. Government into a
                        position where the latter's prestige is involved. The President also
                        mentioned briefly the Cuban situation and the belligerent attitude of the
                        Cuban government, as well as the Congo situation, which the U.S. hoped could
                        be resolved peacefully. The President stressed the need for leaving
                        communications channels clear in order to make it possible to reach
                        solutions that would recognize the interests of both sides. The President
                        also touched briefly upon the subject of disarmament and said that he hoped
                        that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would be willing to
                        reword his statement in such a way as to indicate that preliminary
                        discussions prior to the resumption of negotiations would also involve
                        countries other than the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. alone. The President said,
                        however, that there would be bilateral discussions with the Soviet Union on
                        that subject. The President said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had agreed with him as to the need for peaceful
                        solutions and had expressed hope that there would be a <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0143"/>chance for a personal exchange of views
                        between the President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. As to his proposed statement on disarmament, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he would
                        discuss this with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> in New York.]<note n="3" xml:id="d50fn3">These and

                        signs of possibility improvement our relations. He expressed particular
                        satisfaction at President's action in stopping our military from making
                        boasting and threatening statements.<note n="3" xml:id="d51fn3">On January
                            27 the White House had introduced stiff controls over speeches and

                        done Soviet military felt obliged reply and this did much to worsen
                        atmosphere. I pointed out President had not only taken steps to prevent
                        statements which did not accurately reflect policy our govt, but was also
                        strengthening civilian control over military policy. K remarked this was
                        important and said they had had problem <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0144"/>with Marshal <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d51fn4"> Georgi K. Zhukov,

                            for “adventurism” and “Bonapartism.”</note> He had been friend of

                        smarter than <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>. When latter
                        became President <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> developed
                        big ideas about his own role. However Soviet system had no place for juntas
                        and when they had thrown <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> out
                        he had himself stated they had been right to do so.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he deplored war
                        propaganda in general and suggested we should conclude agreement, perhaps
                        international one, to prevent publication of war propaganda. This already
                        forbidden in Soviet Union. It might be alleged that this was interference
                        with freedom of press but on contrary it was measure to prevent abuse of
                        press. Press not allowed, for example, to advocate prostitution—why could it
                        not prevent war propaganda. He also started to give example of convention
                        banning chemical warfare but then recalled we had not adhered to this
                        convention—something he had never understood.</p>
                    <p>I said I thought our view was that it was not really practicable to handle
                        this problem by treaty and among other difficulties it was virtually
                        impossible draw line and say what was war propaganda and what not. I thought
                        however much could be done to diminish this type activity particularly if
                        appropriate lead given at top.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then said he had fully
                        agreed with President's position that we must both display restraint and try
                        avoid confrontation of power of our two countries. They had however been
                        very much disturbed by <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>'
                        speech. When I inquired what particular passage he had objected to he could
                        not recall exactly but mentioned problems of Congo, Cuba, and Laos. (I
                        believe Soviets had in mind particularly sentence beginning “Our
                        international interests are not compatible with the global objectives of
                        Soviet long-range strategy.”)</p>
                    <p>With respect to Congo K said what had happened there and particularly murder
                        of Lumumba had helped communism. Lumumba was not Communist and he doubted if
                        he would have become one. He was man with limited outlook who easily became
                        excited. He remarked we had discussed this problem before and Soviet
                        position known.</p>
                    <p>Turning to Cuba he could not agree with our policy there. Each country should
                        be free to choose its social system. They did not agree, for example, with
                        Yugoslav internal policies but this did not prevent them from having good
                        relations with that country. He said President had indicated that financial
                        aid would be given to aid in overthrow of present Cuban Govt. Bands of
                        émigrés had been formed and threats made against Cuban Govt. He said Soviet
                        Govt. would openly support Cuban Govt and would give them economic aid. He
                        pointed out Soviet Union had no base in Cuba and only base there belonged to
                        us. He then went on <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0145"/>to question our
                        policy of having bases all around Soviet Union. He dwelt particularly on
                        question of Iran. He said this was poor country where govt was doing little
                        to help people. He said Shah liked to consider himself Monarch but his
                        ancestry not particularly enviable. We sought special rights for ourselves
                        everywhere. Soviet Union was not threatening Iran. Our trouble was that we
                        were not confident of our own system. We had set up alliances to protect
                        members not only from outside aggression but from subversion. Only
                        subversionists in countries like Iran were students and others who were
                        dissatisfied with conditions. We had military advisors in Iran and although
                        he indicated he was not making a demand he wished to state that it would be
                        most useful to our good relations if these were withdrawn.</p>
                    <p>Reverting again to Cuba he asked why we did not establish diplomatic
                        relations with that country and try to resolve our problems with it
                        peacefully. He made clear Cubans had not put him up to this but he was
                        merely speaking his own mind.</p>
                    <p>I replied that with respect to Congo we had hoped <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would be able deal with this problem and that we could both
                        have remained out of it. However Soviet Union had started furnishing
                        military and other supplies to one faction. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> intervened to state they had furnished medicines
                        and in any event these had been supplied to legal govt. He also said we were
                        aware of his views on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> was US agent and carried out
                        our orders. I denied this and said many of his actions had annoyed us but we
                        considered him objective. I went on to say that I thought what bothered us
                        particularly about Cuba was its use as a base for attempts on overthrow of
                        other Latin American govts. When he disputed this I said I had heard Cuban
                        pilots were being trained in Czechoslovakia in flying jet planes. Cuba would
                        never be able attack us and therefore these presumably were designed for use
                        against other Latin American countries. I said we had been most patient with
                        Castro. In first place we had cut off supply of arms to Batista<note n="5" xml:id="d51fn5">Fulgencio Batista y Zaldivar, President of Cuba until
                            January 1959.</note> and although there had been differences of opinion
                        in US about <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> we had been fully
                        prepared accept his govt. However he had made most violent statements
                        against US and had confiscated our assets there without compensation and
                        finally had insisted on reducing our Embassy to handful of people. We had
                        tried to be patient but he had given us no choice. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> said we were using Embassy to harbor
                        spies and <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> was not Communist. He
                        said he had not heard of any training of jet pilots but if he were <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> he would buy jet planes since these
                        were necessary to prevent arms being dropped to counter-revolutionaries from
                        planes flying from US. He thought that in one case we had even admitted
                        this. I said we had taken strict steps to prevent such activities although
                        there <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0146"/>had I believed been one case
                        in which a plane had gotten through. In concluding <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said we should continue to be
                        patient and should try to improve our relations with Cuba.</p>
                    <p>He said he considered Soviet position in world was good since they were on
                        side of people trying to improve their lot. US was supporting reactionary
                        govts in many places. We often spoke of elections and he inquired what would
                        be result of election in Spain or South Vietnam or South Korea. In latter
                        Syngman Rhee <note n="6" xml:id="d51fn6">President of the Republic of
                            Korea.</note> had disappeared but new man was not much better and people
                        were dissatisfied. He did not think even we knew what went on in <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>'s<note n="7" xml:id="d51fn7">
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName>, President and
                            Secretary of National Defense of the Republic of South Vietnam.</note>
                        govt in Vietnam. I replied that there were cases where we supported
                        reactionary govts and there were two reasons for this. First was that we did
                        not believe we should intervene in internal affairs of these countries and
                        second was we were concerned at these countries being threatened by
                        Communist expansion. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said
                        he welcomed President's idea of our competing in economic field and in such
                        matters as culture and to see who could bring people the most happiness. If
                        our system could demonstrate it could do this better than communism he was
                        ready to embrace our system. I said I could only repeat what I had said to
                        him before, namely that much of our difficulty came from our different
                        points of view and misinformation and misunderstanding. US wanted nothing
                        more than prosperity and happiness of all peoples throughout world but we
                        did not think this should come about by outside intervention. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied Soviet Union was also

                        action. Consequently, we should consider immediately what encouragement and

                        pleased and hopeful at President's initiative. Re <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> speech I believe they are genuinely
                        concerned that we may be saying that accommodation with us means they must
                        renounce any support of govts which come into being by revolution and
                        refrain from adopting attitude which would encourage such revolutions. This
                        they not prepared do. Realistic question is whether they prepared refrain
                        from initiating active subversion. With possible exception Laos they feel
                        they have clear conscience since in Cuba and Iraq they did not take
                        initiative. Khrushchev said he had never heard of Castro until it was
                        announced he had taken Havana. Even in Laos they consider they were
                        responding to our initiative. I am not supporting these contentions but
                        believe they should be taken into consideration in judging <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> intentions. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> pointed out there is no industrial proletariat in
                        country like Congo and he mentioned they had excellent relations with Ghana
                        and Guinea which were <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0148"/>not Communist
                        countries. <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s of course wish to expand
                        their influence and his citing latter two countries not particularly
                        reassuring. My judgment is Sovs will continue give political and propaganda
                        support to movements against what they consider reactionary govts throughout
                        world and that they will extend their influence wherever possible but that
                        they can be brought to refrain from militant subversion by direct action
                        such as heavy infiltration of agents, etc. I believe <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> recognizes that newly developing
                        countries particularly in Africa will not be ripe for communism for long
                        time to come. I consider most discouraging aspect <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s current policy is his attitude

                    <p>The President's Special Assistant, Arthur Schlesinger, expressed his
                        opposition to the planned paramilitary action against Cuba in a memorandum
                        to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, April 5, 1961.
                        He argued that the operation was likely to turn into a protracted civil
                        conflict which would “give the Soviet Union a magnificent opportunity to
                        wage political warfare. Cuba will become our Hungary; and, since our
                        pretensions to international good behavior have been greater than those of
                        the Russians, we would be more damaged by Hungary than they were (and they
                        were considerably damaged).” Schlesinger questioned, however, the view that
                        “this operation would have serious substantive effect on Soviet policy, in
                        Laos or elsewhere. My guess is that the Soviet Union regards Cuba as in our
                        domain and is rather surprised that we have not taken action before this to
                        rid ourselves of Castro.” For text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v10">

                        Soviet restraint in not stimulating other crises. For example, if Laotian
                        situation were still as sensitive as now, or if new crisis had developed in
                        another area, popular reaction in the US would probably be hostile to a
                        meeting and thus prevent it from assisting in the relief of international
                        tensions. Therefore, President would not wish now to have any firm

                    <p>The landings of the Cuban Expeditionary Force at the Bay of Pigs on the
                        southern coast of Cuba began on April 17, 1961. On April 18, the Department
                        of State received telegram 2550 from Moscow conveying a letter to President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> from Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. The letter, which the Soviet
                        Government made public, expressed “indignation” at the invasion of Cuba by
                        armed bands “trained, equipped and armed in the United States” and called on
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> to “put an end to aggression.” The letter
                        also declared that the Soviet Union would “render the Cuban people and their
                        government all necessary help to repel armed attack” and implied that the
                        Soviet Union might retaliate by menacing U.S. interests elsewhere. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> responded the same day in
                        a letter handed to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> and released to the press.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> stated that the “United States intends no
                        military intervention in Cuba” but could not conceal its “admiration for
                        Cuban patriots who wish to see a democratic system in an independent Cuba.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> also warned the Soviets not to use the
                        situation in Cuba as a pretext to inflame other areas of the world. For text

                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied to
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s letter of April 18 in a long letter of
                        April 22 in which he reiterated and expanded upon his charge of aggression
                        against Cuba and again pledged Soviet support for <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Fidel Castro</persName>'s government. For text, see ibid., pages 10-16.
                        The Department of State responded the same day with a statement in effect
                        dismissing <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s letter as
                        unworthy of reply. For text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, May 8, 1961, page 663.</p>
                    <p>In the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs crisis, U.S. policy makers reassessed
                        Soviet involvement in Cuba and the threat posed to the United States and its
                        interests in Latin America. In a memorandum to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, April 21, Deputy Special Assistant
                        for National Security Affairs Rostow raised the issue of “a potential Soviet
                        offensive base in Cuba.” The United States must decide whether to permit
                        Castro to acquire defensive arms, asserted <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>, and “what the touchstones are between defensive arms
                        and the creation of a Communist military base <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0152"/>threatening the U.S. itself. I assume that evidence of the
                        latter we would take virtually as a cause of war.” For text of the
                        memorandum, see <ref target="frus1961-63v10">

                    <p>In an April 26 paper prepared for the National Security Council, the Central
                        Intelligence Agency reviewed Soviet bloc military aid to Cuba, noting that
                        since September 1960 its value was estimated at between $50 million and $100
                        million. A May 2 report prepared jointly by the Department of State and the
                        Central Intelligence Agency stated that “with continuing material and
                        technical assistance from the Bloc and with further military training and
                        political indoctrination, under Bloc tutelage, the combat effectiveness of
                        the Cuban armed forces will substantially increase. The Bloc will probably
                        provide some <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-17's when Cuban pilots
                        training in Czechoslovakia return home. However, the buildup of a sizable
                        jet air force in Cuba will probably be a slow process as compared with the
                        improvement of the army. Nonnuclear air defense missiles may be supplied to
                        Cuba, but the Bloc will not supply offensive type missiles nor nuclear
                        weapons.” A May 4 paper prepared for the National Security Council by an
                        Interagency Task Force on Cuba stated that there was “no danger of effective
                        direct attack against the U.S.” and only a “remote possibility of an attempt
                        to convert Cuba into a Russian base for strategic attack on the United
                        States.” However, Cuba clearly served “as an exporter of physical aids to
                        revolution” and “as an example and stimulus to communist revolution.” For
                        text of the two papers and the report, see ibid., pages 389-390, 417-422,

                    <p>While we clearly have no commitment for release of Powers, one interpretation
                        of Soviet actions described above is that Soviet Government would be

                        betterment relations if we were to have released Melekh unconditionally, and
                        we were at least partially motivated by this interpretation in taking action
                        as we did. You should therefore seek appointment at appropriate level in
                        Foreign Ministry and recall these informal conversations re release of
                        Melekh. You should indicate that, in light of Soviet approach, we took
                        action to free Melekh unconditionally and that we are now hopeful that
                        Soviet Government for its part will release Powers in similar step to help
                        eliminate differences between us. Timing this approach left to your

                    <p>In telegram Supnu 1549, April 21, 1961, the U.S. delegation to the Geneva
                        Disarmament Conference informed the Department of State that since the
                        resumption of negotiations on March 21 the Soviets had “not only stood still
                        on positions they have been maintaining since the summit meeting last
                        spring” but have made it “clear that they are not budging in even the most
                        minute particular from previous positions.” In a memorandum prepared for a
                        National Security Council meeting on April 22, <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">John McCloy</persName> stated that “it now appears clear that the

                        possible inability for wives obtain exit permits (what would students do if

                    <p>Under cover of a memorandum dated May 3, 1961, Deputy Secretary of Defense
                        Gilpatric forwarded to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> for consideration by the National Security Council a
                        paper entitled “A Program of Action To Prevent Communist Domination of South
                        Vietnam,” which had been prepared by an interdepartmental Task Force. Among
                        the paper's proposals was the following: “We should consider joining with
                        the Viet-Namese in a clear cut defensive alliance which might include
                        stationing of U.S. forces on Viet-Namese soil.” Such a move “would place the
                        Sino-Soviet Bloc in the position of risking direct intervention in a
                        situation where U.S. forces were already in place.” For text of the paper,

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Developments in Soviet Foreign Policy</p>
                    <p>Moscow last week expanded its attacks on the US over the events in Cuba to
                        include vituperative criticism of the President personally as well as broad
                        denunciations of US policies—especially in the “Observer” articles in <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> on 28 and 30 April. While the Soviet leaders
                        are determined to exact the maximum propaganda gains from the Cuban
                        developments, their treatment of the May Day activities suggests that they
                        do not plan a long period of bitter hostility toward the US such as followed
                        the U-2 incident. Their statements made no mention of the U-2 affair of last
                        May Day, and the official editorials for this year's celebrations and the
                        address by Marshal <persName corresp="#p_MRY1">Malinovsky</persName> were
                        relatively moderate in comparison with the “Observer” articles and not
                        predominantly anti-American in content.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>'s editorial on 1 May, however, referred to the
                        “criminal intrigues of American imperialism” in Cuba, and Malinovsky in his
                        order <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0157"/>of the day and speech in Red
                        Square repeated this line, stating that “armed intervention” against Cuba
                        was organized by “imperialist circles of the US.” <persName corresp="#p_MRY1">Malinovsky</persName> also warned that the “aggressive
                        circles of the imperialist states … are resorting more and more frequently
                        to military action to put down the growing national liberation movement” in
                        Africa, Asia, and Latin America.</p>
                    <p>The military section of the Moscow parade differed little from those in
                        recent years. No new equipment was shown, and the emphasis was on missiles
                        and armor, a common practice for several years. <persName corresp="#p_MRY1">Malinovsky</persName> claimed at one point that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> now has “perfect weapons which excel
                        anything an army has ever had.” Although this could be taken to refer to
                        weapons as yet unrevealed, it is more likely that he was merely praising the
                        general quality of Soviet military equipment. In Berlin, the East German
                        Army displayed 21 T-54 medium tanks and about 15 armored amphibious tanks,
                        the first seen in its possession.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MRY1">Malinovsky</persName>'s warning that West
                        Germany is the main point of military peril in Europe reflects the
                        increasing attention given to Germany by the bloc. A communiqué issued on 28
                        April at the end of Rumanian leader Gheorghiu-Dej's visit to Warsaw called
                        for the “fastest possible” conclusion of the German peace treaty and
                        transformation of West Berlin into a demilitarized free city. The communiqué
                        also warned that the bloc would sign a separate peace treaty if the Western
                        powers continue to “endlessly delay the conclusion of a treaty with the two
                        German states.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> also took up the German
                        and Berlin issues in his conversation with West German Ambassador Kroll on
                        24 April. He used this talk to offset the impression that he was committed
                        to a showdown on these issues before the Soviet party congress in October.
                        He claimed that originally he planned to call for a settlement of the
                        problem during the first quarter of 1961 but that he had decided to give
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> more time.</p>
                    <p>While strongly emphasizing his determination to settle the issues during
                        1961, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> told Kroll that the
                        bloc had set no precise deadlines and would be willing to wait until the
                        West German elections and “possibly” until after the party congress before
                        convening a bloc peace conference to sign a separate treaty with East
                        Germany. Such restraint, however, would depend on no “unexpected” Western
                        moves, such as a Bundestag meeting in Berlin.</p>
                    <p>As to the consequences of a separate peace treaty, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> stated that the Western powers
                        would have to make arrangements with East Germany to maintain their
                        communications with Berlin and that he would advise <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> to abolish the air corridors. In
                        response to Kroll's statement that this could bring about an international
                        crisis, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he was
                        convinced that the West would not risk a general nuclear war over Berlin. He
                        said that he expected the West to resort to economic sanctions <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0158"/>and possibly a break in diplomatic
                        relations, but that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could cope
                        with such measures.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> assured Kroll that the
                        prospect of a showdown over Berlin “need not affect negotiations already
                        begun with the US,” but added that he was skeptical about the outcome of any
                        such negotiations. Although <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> failed to mention prior East-West negotiations
                        before a bloc peace conference, his willingness to give the President more
                        time suggests that he still expects a further round of negotiations. His
                        readiness to wait until next fall also suggests that he is aware that the
                        process of arranging new talks will take longer than he anticipated last
                        fall and that negotiations could extend beyond the party congress.</p>

                        called me in this afternoon and reading from paper made following statement.
                        NSK would have liked personally to have talked with me and to have set forth
                        certain considerations in connection with confidential letter from President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                        <note n="2" xml:id="d65fn2">See <ref target="#d41">Document 41</ref>.</note>
                        that I had transmitted to him in Novosibirsk. However he is leaving Moscow
                        and expects return only by May 20. Soviet Govt and <gloss target="#t_NSK1">NSK</gloss> deplore fact that discord has occurred of late between our
                        two countries in connection with events regarding Cuba. He would not like to
                        repeat what was said by Soviet Govt and <gloss target="#t_NSK1">NSK</gloss>
                        personally with regard to Cuba and US policies concerning that country.
                        Position of Soviet Govt on this question was repeatedly outlined by <gloss target="#t_NSK1">NSK</gloss> personally including occasion of his talk
                        with me in Novosibirsk. SovGov regrets that the above-mentioned events have
                        taken place and also regrets events in Laos as they have declared to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> in setting forth views of SovGov on Laotian
                        problem. But if Soviet Union and US do not consider that there is an
                        unbridgeable gulf between them, then both should draw appropriate conclusion
                        from this, namely that we live on one planet and therefore ways should be
                        found to settle appropriate questions and to build up our relations. In
                        other words bridges have to be built which would link our countries. This
                        viewpoint <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0159"/>is held by SovGov.
                        Initiative displayed in regard to a meeting by President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> met with favorable attitude on part
                        of SovGov and at present it would like to know whether or not proposal by
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> on meeting and
                        exchange of views remains valid or whether proposal made is being revised.
                            <gloss target="#t_SU1">SU</gloss> still thinks above-mentioned
                        initiative is useful for both countries.</p>
                    <p>Events that took place lately yet again confirm necessity of contacts between
                        US and <gloss target="#t_SU1">SU</gloss> including contacts at highest
                        level. Soviet Union owes debt in sense they have not yet replied by letter
                        to confidential letter of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> in which was formulated proposal on meeting. Before
                        sending reply they naturally would like to know how matters will take shape
                        now. If President as hitherto favors meeting and exchange of views on
                        relevant problems that is one thing. If for some reason he now holds
                        different viewpoint that is quite another matter and Soviet Union would
                        regret if that is so. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he
                        would be grateful if I could inform him on this matter whenever I am in
                        position to do so.</p>

                        Congo, Laos and Cuba President has made clear his firm stance in face of

                    <p>2) On long range, Soviets will be taking major decisions at Party Congress
                        for which preparations now in progress and it is to our interest to
                        influence these decisions;</p>
                    <p>3) Mere fact of meeting will exacerbate Soviet-Chinese relations;</p>
                    <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0160"/>
                    <p>4) Believe Soviets correct in stating that recent events make meeting even
                        more necessary;</p>
                    <p>5) Consider on balance meeting would strengthen position of US before world
                        opinion and put US in better position to take strong stand on Berlin and
                        other questions;</p>
                    <p>6) Despite recent sharp exchanges and Soviet actions do not believe there has
                        been any major change in Soviet policy or <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s intentions. While it has always been clear that
                        Soviets seek communization of world <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> continues advocate peaceful means. Essential
                        point of exercise would be to further President's policy of recognizing
                        basic conflict of interest between us but endeavoring to avoid or minimize
                        confrontation of two great powers in military sense. In this connection at
                        risk being considered apologist suggest we should keep in mind that in
                        recent trouble spots; Iraq, Congo, Cuba and so far as I am informed Laos,
                        Soviets did not initiate crisis but followed their usual policy of taking
                        advantage of opportunities.</p>

                        concerning a meeting. The President remains desirous of meeting <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. He hopes that it will be
                        possible to adhere to the original schedule of early June in Vienna but is
                        not at the moment in a position to make a firm decision on this point.
                        However, he will be able to give a definite reply prior to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s return to Moscow on May

                    <p>FYI—In addition to the problem of the relationship of the meeting with
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to the <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De Gaulle</persName> visit, there are, as you
                        indicated in <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0161"/>your comments, a
                        number of other considerations which the President must have in mind before
                        making a definite commitment. Chief among these is the situation in regard
                        to Laos but we should well before May twentieth have a clearer indication of
                        the probable course of events. If for example the Laos subject is in the
                        process of pacific negotiations at the proposed Geneva Conference, this
                        would be a circumstance which would render the meeting easier from the point
                        of view of public opinion here and abroad. If on the other hand the
                        conference does not take place and the situation is again exacerbated in
                        Laos, it would not be desirable for the President to be meeting with
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The President is taking up in a confidential personal message with <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De Gaulle</persName>

                        the Paris visit to a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> immediately thereafter and this will be an
                        important initial factor in the President's ultimate decision. What you
                        should seek to convey to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> is
                        the President's continued desire to meet <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and leave no impression of any holdback in this
                        respect but merely emphasize that there are a number of considerations which
                        have to be examined before a definite date can be set.</p>
                    <p>For domestic political reasons the President would have to be in a position
                        of indicating certain specific subjects that he was to discuss with
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Obviously one would
                        be the nuclear test talks since according to present plans they will still
                        be in session in early June. Since it would be desirable to have more than
                        one subject, we would appreciate any suggestions that you have concerning
                        other questions which President might discuss with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, with some prospect of progress,
                        to be publicly announced along with test ban topic. The fact of public
                        announcement would obviously exclude a number of questions in particular
                        Berlin, but possible upcoming disarmament talks apart from test ban might be
                            conceivable.<note n="4" xml:id="d67fn4">In telegram 2736, May 6,

                    <p>The opening of the International Conference on Laos in Geneva, scheduled for
                        May 12, 1961, was postponed in order to resolve a dispute between the West
                        and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on the seating of Laotian
                        delegations. In telegram Secto 118 to the Department of State, May 14,
                        Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> reported that
                        Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        continued his insistence that the Pathet Lao delegation be one of the three
                        Laotian delegations seated. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        did agree, however, to a statement that all three were delegations “from”
                        and not “of” Laos. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> recommended
                        that the United States agree to the opening of the conference on that basis,
                        though taking every opportunity to make clear that the U.S. considered the
                        Royal Laotian Government the only government in Laos. The conference
                        convened on May 16. For text of telegram Secto 118, see <ref target="frus1961-63v24">

                    <p>In telegram Secto 164 to the Department of State, May 17, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, expressed concern that events were
                        moving more rapidly in Laos than had been expected “with respect to a
                        coalition government which we will not like.” He noted that the “Commies in
                        Geneva are full of confidence and appear to be utterly relaxed about
                        achieving their goals in Laos.” Their speeches were moderate and their
                        demeanor friendly. “I find it difficult to believe that this is because they
                        want a neutral Laos as we see it.” For text, see ibid., pages 199-200.</p>

                        conference and increasingly active fighting in Laos. “Soviet maneuvers have
                        placed us in exact position we earlier declined to accept, namely, attending

                    <p>At his request, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName>
                        called on the President at 10:00 a.m. today and read to him from an English
                        translation made by the Soviet Embassy the text of a letter dated May 12
                        from Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in reply to
                        the President's letter of February 22,<note n="2" target="d69fn2">See <ref target="#d35">Document 35</ref>.</note> which was delivered to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> by Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> in Novosibirsk on March
                        9.</p>
                    <p>After Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> had
                        finished reading the text, the President commented that the last time the
                        subject had been broached was in the conversation of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and he had indicated a reply would
                        be forthcoming by May 20 when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was expected to return to Moscow. At that time it
                        was not clear when the conference on Laos would begin and when the
                        international atmosphere would be conducive to a meeting or whether it
                        should be put off. Now there have been these press reports about the
                        possibility of a meeting. The President said he would wish to talk to
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> before giving a
                        definite reply but he would expect that in the next two days a reply might
                        be given.</p>
                    <p>The President added that if it is decided to go ahead with the meeting Vienna
                        is a place which appeared to be mutually agreed upon and he would expect to
                        leave late in the afternoon on Friday, June 2, from Paris and would stay in
                        Vienna Saturday and Sunday, leaving Vienna either Sunday night or Monday
                        morning. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> would
                        accompany him.</p>
                    <p>The President continued that if he is going ahead on this meeting, one of the
                        problems would be how this meeting should be described in public statements.
                        It would not be useful to say that we are going to reach <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0164"/>agreement on Laos or a nuclear testing ban
                        because if we could not reach agreement then nothing would come out of the
                        meeting. It would perhaps be best to emphasize that this would provide an
                        opportunity for a general exchange of views.</p>
                    <p>The President remarked that he had only met Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> once before and that was as a member of the
                        Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the occasion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s visit to this country. The
                        President was doubtful that any agreement on Laos or on nuclear testing
                        would be reached by the time of his visit to Europe and it was important
                        that the hopes of the peoples not be disappointed by false expectation of
                        concrete results from a meeting. He wanted to better the present situation
                        and not worsen it. In this connection, the President made a passing
                        reference to reports which had already appeared in the press speculating on
                        the possibility of a meeting between himself and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> slyly remarked
                        that nothing had appeared in the Soviet press, as the President knew. The
                        President responded that he had felt impelled to inform President <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De Gaulle</persName> of the possibility of this
                            meeting<note n="3" xml:id="d69fn3">See <ref target="#d67fn2">Document 67
                                and footnote 2</ref> thereto.</note> in view of his official state
                        visit to France, that inevitably this involved others becoming aware of this
                        possibility, and, moreover, he believed that Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had informed Walter Lippmann
                        during the latter's recent visit to Moscow.<note n="4" xml:id="d69fn4">
                            Walter Lippmann's articles on his April 11 interview with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> appeared in <hi rend="italic">The Washington Post</hi>, April 17-19, 1961. The
                            Embassy in Moscow transmitted a 1-page summary of the conversation in
                            telegram 2472 from Moscow, April 11. (Department of State, Central
                            Files, 961.6122/4-1161)</note> The important thing was that an accurate
                        impression be given in any public statements which will be made as to the
                        purpose of the meeting, which, in his view, would be for a general exchange
                        of opinions on many issues which, of course, involve the interests of other
                        countries and could not be the subject of negotiation or agreement between
                        just the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> quoted from the
                        final paragraphs of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s May
                        12 letter referring to a general exchange of views.</p>
                    <p>The President then went on to remark that if we cannot accomplish anything
                        concrete on a nuclear test ban, it would be doubtful that we could make
                        progress on disarmament; that it was easier to make progress on a nuclear
                        testing treaty and we should try to make progress there. One of the reasons
                        the President desired to talk with Khrushchev was that he believed the
                        nuclear test talks were crucial negotiations and if we failed it could not
                        help affect progress on other matters, particularly disarmament.</p>
                    <p>There was then some discussion as to what Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> should say to the press who were
                        waiting in great numbers outside. It was agreed that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> should merely say that he had <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0165"/>delivered a message from Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in reply to the
                        President's letter of February 22. The White House would confirm this but
                        not add anything until there had been a reply on the subject of a possible
                        meeting with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in
                        Vienna. In this connection, the President pointed out that we would have to
                        talk with the Austrians and that he desired to talk with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> before giving a final reply. If it was
                        decided to meet in Vienna, it would be desirable to discuss the type of
                        public statement which might be issued by the US and Soviet Governments.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> remarked that the
                        President had used the word “if”. The President replied that he remembered
                        that in the last conversation between Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that the Ambassador had said we would communicate
                        our final decision before May 20 when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was expected back in Moscow; that the final
                        decision would depend on the international climate at the time; that a month
                        ago the atmosphere was not as satisfactory as it had been previously or,
                        perhaps, as it was today. However, the President would talk with Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and he would hope that a
                        response could be made within the next day or so.</p>

                    <p>On February 21, 1961, Assistant Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> sent Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> a memorandum asking him to raise at a
                        Cabinet meeting the question of Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName>'s appointments with U.S.
                        officials. In reply <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked whether
                        the U.S. Government might request the Ambassador to make all such
                        appointments through the Department of State and how this practice conformed
                        to Soviet procedures in Moscow. In an April 12 memorandum <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> replied that Soviet practice was to
                        conduct all appointments through either the Foreign Ministry or Ministry of
                        Foreign Trade, but that in recent years direct contacts with Soviet
                        officials had expanded, and the Department of State was “most reluctant to
                        provide any excuse for a reversal of this trend.” To this end he suggested
                        raising at Cabinet level coordination of <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName>'s appointments “in some fashion.” (All in
                        Department of State, Central Files, 601.6111/4-1261)</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>
                        discussed the problem with <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge
                            Bundy</persName> following the Cabinet meeting on April 20 and proposed
                        that the question be handled in a memorandum from the Department of State to
                        the White House suggesting that individual memoranda be sent to each Cabinet
                        member outlining the procedure for making appointments with <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName>. (<gloss target="#t_SS1">S/S</gloss> memorandum, May 3; ibid., 601.6111/5-361) On May 20 the
                        Department of State sent the memorandum to the White House asking that any
                        official having “any discussion” with <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> provide the Department of State with a record of
                        the conversation and offering to make available for such meetings, officers
                        proficient in Russian. (Ibid., 601.6111/5-2061)</p>

                    <p>D. To gain a clearer understanding of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> as a man and of Soviet policy and intentions.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>A. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will probably
                        seek—directly or indirectly— to convey and gain acceptance of the following
                        view of the world situation:</p>
                    <p>1. The world is divided into two power systems, the communist and the
                        capitalist.</p>
                    <p>2. The communist system is firmly established beyond challenge in the bloc
                        countries and the processes of political change can take place only in the
                        non-communist countries.</p>
                    <p>3. The balance of world power has shifted and is shifting toward the
                        communist system, the Sino-Soviet bloc.</p>
                    <p>4. The Soviet Union does not wish to advance that process by war, that is, a
                        major global nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>5. Neither can the capitalist powers afford to inhibit that process by resort
                        to war.</p>
                    <p>6. The capitalist powers must recognize the “realities” of the world
                        situation, i.e., the power shift toward the bloc, and accommodate themselves
                        to changes which accord with the “will of the people,” i.e., Laos, Cuba, the
                        Congo.</p>
                    <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0168"/>
                    <p>7. Part of this “realistic” approach requires the recognition that no
                        significant decision on international questions anywhere in the world or in
                        international bodies can be taken without accommodating the views of the
                        Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>8. The process of contention between the systems can be carried on by all
                        means short of war, i.e., overt war across international borders, without
                        the risk of global war and without serious effect on U.S.-Soviet relations
                        or the prospects of disarmament.</p>
                    <p>9. Those relations should be improved; there are no important bilateral
                        differences impeding them; but the U.S. should remove its discriminatory
                        trade policies and withdraw from foreign bases threatening the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>10. The Soviet Union is seriously interested in disarmament but not control
                        and inspection systems without actual disarmament; its proposals are
                        comprehensive and control provisions could be worked out if the Western
                        powers accepted the Soviet proposals.</p>
                    <p>11. The problems of Berlin and a peace treaty are urgent and should be
                        solved.</p>
                    <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> probably is confident
                        that the communist chances in the long run are good. However, he has a
                        healthy respect and probably a reasonably accurate understanding of the
                        military power and productive capacity of the Western nations, particularly
                        the United States. He, therefore, has little taste for risky adventures.</p>
                    <p>He believes that there is still room for steady communist gains. This belief
                        stems in part from his doubt that the Western powers have the will or
                        resolve to translate their resources into the elements of power sufficient
                        to cope with the bloc and his doubt that they can find the basis for
                        building effective non-communist political institutions in the
                        under-developed countries. He, consequently, is led to the conclusion that
                        by alternating pressure and overtures he can make the gains at the
                        negotiating table and by shielding local Communist advances with Soviet
                        power. He is also constantly conscious of the specter of growing Communist
                        Chinese power and this gives him added reason to maintain his communication
                        with the Western powers and to explore the terms of a possible accommodation
                        with them.</p>
                    <p>There are indications that he is sufficiently concerned over the risks of
                        nuclear war and sufficiently convinced of Soviet political capabilities
                        abroad to be seriously interested in disarmament. However, he finds
                        political capital in playing on the disarmament issue and has apparently not
                        thought through the problems associated with disarmament in any meaningful
                        way. He, therefore, has probably not reached conclusions on the terms under
                        which various disarmament measures would be acceptable.</p>
                    <p>He will undoubtedly press hard his position on Berlin and a peace treaty with
                        East Germany and will try to get some form of commitment to negotiate the
                        Berlin question.</p>

                    <p>This meeting itself gratifies him and he may extend the President an
                        invitation to visit the Soviet Union if the talks go reasonably well from
                        his point of view.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Tactics</p>
                    <p>In an exchange of this type, particularly with so outspoken an leader as
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, it is not practicable
                        to expect that the course of the talks can be charted in advance. However,
                        the total content of the President's remarks to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> should convey the clear impression that
                        essentially two broad alternatives are open to the Soviet Union. It can seek
                        to encroach on the free world. In this event, force will surely be met with
                        counter-force, the costly and dangerous arms race will be continued and
                        probably accelerated and the risk of nuclear war will probably become acute.
                        Alternatively, it can seek an accommodation of legitimate Soviet national
                        interests with ours, reduce the intensity level of our confrontation, open
                        up the prospect of arms limitation with its attendant benefits and broaden
                        the area of mutually profitable cooperative endeavor. It should be borne in
                        mind that current Soviet foreign policy which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will espouse presupposes the charting of a course
                        profitable to the Soviet Union between these two alternatives.</p>
                    <p>The tone of our approach should not be ultimative. It can emerge from the
                        discussion of our approach to the vital problems of U.S.-Soviet relations as
                        the realistic recognition of the logical course of events. We keep well to
                        the forefront of the discussion our earnest desire and our readiness to
                        build a basis for constructive relations and our conviction that this course
                        is in the Soviet as well as our national interest. But we make it clear that
                        our patience has already been severely tested and that we are determined
                        that there be no Soviet illusion concerning our intent and capacity to
                        resist communist encroachments by whatever means are needed.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps one convincing way to make the point is to stress the urgent need and
                        our most serious desire for prompt agreements on disarmament measures and to
                        insist throughout the talks that all other questions, including Berlin and
                        Germany specifically, are secondary to this one. It should be made explicit
                        that this does not mean that disarmament talks can proceed hopefully
                        regardless of the state of political relations. On the contrary, it should
                        be stressed that the acceptance, whether formal or tacit, of reasonably
                        orderly and peaceful procedures for affecting political change and
                        protecting national and human rights is fundamentally necessary to an
                        atmosphere in which disarmament talks could be promising. Exchanges on this
                        point will afford ample opportunity to convey our determination to meet
                        communist incursions and to articulate our concept of a peaceful world
                        community within which legitimate Soviet national interests can continuously
                        be accommodated or negotiated.</p>
                    <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0170"/>
                    <p>The talks might well be opened with a discussion of the nuclear testing
                        talks. This is a subject in which we have an immediate interest and a
                        current tactical advantage; it serves to emphasize our interest in
                        disarmament, and the Soviet tripartite proposals are both a matter of
                        important concern to us and a favorable ground on which to criticize the
                        Soviet world outlook and the dual nature of Soviet foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>The President's exposition and criticism of the Soviet world outlook and the
                        reality of communist rule within individual countries will inevitably call
                        forth a spirited if not heated rejoinder. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s reply will doubtless be lengthy. In order to
                        preserve time during the second day for an exposition of our view of a
                        constructive world order, the discussion of matters more capable of solution
                        and to reserve the possibility of ending the talks on a hopeful note, this
                        sensitive topic should probably be brought up toward the end of the first
                        day's conversation.</p>
                    <p>The second day would proceed from the discussion of divergences in beliefs to
                        more immediate problems of courses of action: disarmament negotiations, the
                        possibility of negotiations on Germany and Berlin, the provision for
                        peaceful transition in the newly independent areas, and, if it is
                        appropriate, cooperative endeavors in the fields of science and
                        exchanges.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Invitation to the Soviet Union</p>
                    <p>The President might say that he appreciates the invitation and would welcome
                        the opportunity to visit the Soviet Union. Both he and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> appear to have heavy schedules
                        for the immediate future. An improved outlook for U.S.-Soviet relations
                        would be a desirable background for such a visit. As <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> visited here in 1959, there
                        would appear to be no need for a reciprocal invitation to him at this
                        time.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p rend="center">Vienna, June 3-4, 1961</p>
                    <p rend="center">Talking Points</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Testing Talks</p>
                    <p>1. The U.S. attaches great importance to the prompt and successful conclusion
                        of a testing agreement not only for itself but as a means of moving to
                        prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons and particularly as providing
                        evidence and precedent of U.S. and Soviet ability to reach agreement on an
                        important issue and in the disarmament field and to create a favorable
                        climate for moving forward in broader fields of disarmament. The
                        consequences of failure are seriously adverse.</p>
                    <p>2. After many months of negotiations, the U.S. undertook thorough and serious
                        review of its position, and the U.S. delegation returned to Geneva with
                        proposals going a considerable way to meet the Soviet position. The
                        President expected that agreement could be promptly reached; he still hopes
                        it can.</p>
                    <p>3. The Soviet response has been disheartening. Not only has there been no
                        Soviet attempt to negotiate seriously but the Soviet Union has withdrawn
                        previous agreement on a single Administrator and has introduced a new
                        political obstruction by its proposal for a tripartite Administrator.</p>
                    <p>4. A tripartite Administrator is not a negotiable proposal. It is totally
                        unacceptable as it would make a control system unworkable by introducing
                        political differences into every administrative and operational measure.</p>
                    <p>5. It is also wholly unnecessary. The political concerns of the parties are
                        fully provided for in the Control Council and the United States went far to
                        accommodate Soviet desires in its composition.</p>
                    <p>6. If the Soviet Union continues to base its position on this principle,
                        there seems little hope for progress in broader disarmament negotiations.
                        The U.S. is not prepared to sign any disarmament agreement with an
                        inoperable administration.</p>
                    <p>7. It is just possible that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        will drop the tripartite administration proposal and propose a broad formula
                        for settling the important <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0172"/>remaining differences. Alternatively, he may ask for the President's
                        suggestion. The President will need to be prepared to use such an opening to
                        discuss the major issues and hopefully to move the talks toward
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>8. If <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s position is rigid
                        and if—but only if—we have made a decision to resume testing in the absence
                        of progress at the talks, the President should convey to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, in whatever terms seem
                        appropriate, the understanding that we regard resumption of testing as our
                        only alternative if no agreement can now be reached.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">World Situation</p>
                    <p>1. We reject the Soviet view of the world and particularly the shift of power
                        to the bloc, and stress that for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        to act on it will mean an intensification of the arms race, a blow to the
                        chances of disarmament and greater risk of the war all should seek to
                        avoid.</p>
                    <p>2. The system of world Communist parties—and the program for action
                        prescribed at the Moscow conference by representatives of the Soviet and
                        eleven other bloc governments—constitute blatant interference in the
                        internal affairs of the 69 other countries from which Communist delegates
                        come, and are a major deterrent to world peace. To make this point we could
                        probe <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s reaction were
                        there a similar system of democratic parties with branches in bloc countries
                        and we might detail the subversive Communist activities in South
                        Viet-Nam.</p>
                    <p>3. We spell out the contradiction between Soviet national interest and the
                        maintenance of the world Communist system, stressing our mutual paramount
                        interest in disarmament and the economic well-being of our peoples and
                        emphasizing in some detail how Communist China will pose this contradiction
                        in more acute and explosive form in the not distant future. We also note the
                        remote connection between Soviet national interest and the engagement of
                        Soviet power in distant areas like Cuba, Laos and the Congo.</p>
                    <p>4. The Soviets can believe Communism will be adopted throughout the world,
                        including the U.S. We believe that democracy will emerge in more and more
                        countries, including the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The
                        important issue is what we each do to bring the objective about and whether
                        we can create the political machinery to accommodate the processes of
                        peaceful change.</p>
                    <p>5. Great restraint is required and we do not consider that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has understood, appreciated or
                        reciprocated the restraint we have shown in Eastern Europe where the
                        political potential for our exploitation is as great as that of the colonial
                        areas is for the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>6. Soviet endorsement of war in colonial areas (Moscow conference) and Soviet
                        efforts to poison and exploit relations between newly independent countries
                        or colonial areas and the Western powers can <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0173"/>only lead to more instances of violence and greater danger
                        the hostilities will expand past control. Past Communist successes should
                        not obscure this truth. In fact, they have made our reaction more
                        certain.</p>
                    <p>7. In our view the national interests of our countries are not directly
                        involved in the character of the regimes in the newly independent
                        countries—so long as the prospect is kept open for expression of the popular
                        will.</p>
                    <p>8. We have no desire to exclude the Soviet Union from normal relations with
                        the newly independent and under-developed countries—but we can not consider
                        those relations fully normal so long as the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> maintains its ties with local Communist parties and
                        groups.</p>
                    <p>9. We detail our concept of a more stable order. Mention could be made of the
                        broad scope for cooperative action—in outer space, in help to
                        under-developed countries, in the fields of science and technology. If the
                        talks have made the moment propitious, cooperative endeavor and expanded
                        exchanges might be discussed in greater detail.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Disarmament</p>
                    <p>1. In the interest of their own security, the well-being of their people and
                        the peace of the world the U.S. and the Soviet Union have a profound common
                        interest in disarmament.</p>
                    <p>2. In the absence of agreements the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the
                        greater rapidity with which delivery systems will operate, still greater
                        risks will become probable.</p>
                    <p>3. The U.S. is prepared to disarm all its forces except for those required
                        for internal security and any forces required to provide authorized security
                        forces for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Disarmament, however, is
                        only one component of a peaceful world community ruled by law and providing
                        for orderly processes of peaceful change and progress in this field must
                        progress in disarmament, particularly in the later stages.</p>
                    <p>4. Given the advanced state of modern arms, disarmament is an extremely
                        complex matter. It involves the most vital questions of national security.
                        It is, therefore, imperative that it be carried out in a way which builds
                        the confidence and trust of the participating parties at all stages. This is
                        equally important for all sides; should serious doubts arise that the system
                        was fulfilling its functions, the prospects for disarmament would be set
                        back for a long time. Some discussion of the common interest in effective
                        control would be in order. Some emphasis might be put on the vital necessity
                        of the control system covering existing as well as surrendered armament and
                        on the incompatibility of the present Soviet concept of military secrecy and
                        a viable control system.</p>
                    <p>5. Consequently, the provisions for implementing and controlling disarmament
                        must be worked out with care and thoroughness. It is not too much to say
                        that the problem of disarmament is virtually the problem <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0174"/>of the provisions for its effective and
                        safeguarded execution. We regard no disarmament proposal as really serious
                        that does not come to grips with the control problem.</p>
                    <p>6. We have suggested that the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> exchange views prior to a resumption of negotiations.
                        Agreement has now been reached to begin the discussion on June 19. We have
                        made this suggestion for the purpose of attempting to arrive at an
                        understanding on the basic framework in which disarmament negotiations
                        should be conducted and on the negotiating forum. At the same time, we would
                        like to discuss actions the two sides could take in order to minimize the
                        dangers inherent in modern weapons systems. For our part, we have been
                        seeking to introduce in our forces safety and precautionary devices aimed at
                        reducing accidents or misinterpretation. However, there is a limit to what
                        we can do unilaterally and we would hope to discuss what can be undertaken
                        of a reciprocal nature.</p>
                    <p>7. We will have proposals to make when disarmament talks are resumed. The
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will also presumably have
                        proposals. We would hope that the negotiations could proceed promptly to a
                        serious consideration of specific disarmament measures without lengthy delay
                        in discussing the merits of the two approaches. Perhaps examination of the
                        means of implementing both Soviet and allied proposals could proceed
                        simultaneously.</p>
                    <p>8. We regard disarmament as a subject too serious to play politics with in
                        the scheduled bilateral talks. We conceded to the Soviet position in order
                        to get talks initiated in the Ten-Nation forum. While we regard disarmament
                        as a concern of all powers, it is a subject for negotiation between the
                        powers directly concerned. The commencement of negotiations should not be
                        delayed by attempts to take them out of that context.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Germany-Berlin</p>
                    <p>1. As <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has pointed out,
                        disarmament is the paramount question of our relations. Questions of Germany
                        and Berlin are second-ary in comparison. They and the question of European
                        security can be approached in a more promising context when progress is made
                        in disarmament.</p>
                    <p>2. Aspects of the situation in Berlin and Germany are unsatisfactory to the
                        Western powers as well as to the Soviet Union but nothing is intolerable to
                        either; the security interests of the Soviet Union are not threatened.</p>
                    <p>3. The wisest course is to leave the situation alone until arms reduction
                        makes solutions easier.</p>
                    <p>4. The association of West Germany in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        and other forms of European integration should alleviate instead of
                        exacerbate Soviet concern. <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0175"/>West
                        Germany has accepted significant limitations on its sovereignty and
                        institutionalized the defensive nature of its armament.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may recall that by his
                        menacing policy Stalin was primarily responsible for creating what he least
                        desired, a coalition of Western European powers and the United States.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might seriously ponder
                        the effect that unilateral Soviet moves in Germany might have. The
                        restraints which Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>
                        has exercised in his conduct of German affairs should not be taken for
                        granted—nor could the Soviet Union assume that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> or his successors would be able to exercise them
                        regardless of Soviet actions. Soviet moves might well make such policies
                        untenable in Germany and might bring about the developments in Germany the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> seeks most to avoid.</p>
                    <p>7. In Berlin the U.S. has undertaken firm commitments and obligations
                        together with its allies. It must and will honor its commitments regardless
                        of the cost.</p>
                    <p>8. If <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> defends the “free
                        city” proposal, the President might state that the U.S. is not prepared to
                        make the fulfillment of its commitments dependent solely on the will of the
                        Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>9. As <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will doubtless press
                        the matter, we should be prepared to say that we will undertake negotiation
                        of the problems of Berlin and Germany at a suitable time, but only as part
                        of a broader discussion of problems of concern to both of us.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Laos</p>
                    <p>1. There are a few reports intimating that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> intends to protract the Geneva Conference on Laos in order
                        that Premier <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may seek to
                        “settle” basic issues bilaterally in his talks with the President, despite
                        the mutual understanding that these talks are only exchanges of views.
                        Whether there is any real basis for such reports is unclear. However, it is
                        probable that (a) a violent, military scuttling of <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0176"/>the cease-fire by the Communists will not
                        occur prior to June 3, (b) Premier <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will raise the problem of Laos in such a manner
                        as to seek some U.S. “agreement” on ways to settle this problem, (c) the
                        present Royal Lao Government under Prime Minister Boun Oum will still be in
                        office, and (d) the Geneva Conference will still be under way.</p>
                    <p>2. The President might welcome both statements that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, like the U.S., seeks a truly neutral
                        Laos and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> moves, in the capacity of
                        co-Chairman, to seek a peaceful settlement through the present Conference.
                        Since that Conference is in session for the expressed purpose of resolving
                        the Laotian problem, it would be inappropriate to attempt to shift
                        negotiations to the Vienna meeting. However, the President might note that
                        the co-Chairmen's instructions to the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>,
                        which led to its recent return to Laos, stated the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>'s basic tasks would be, first, “fixing the cease-fire” and,
                        secondly, exercising control over the execution of an agreement to be
                        negotiated among the belligerent parties on questions related to the
                        cease-fire. Despite these instructions, Pathet Lao represent-atives, in
                        talks convened to discuss “questions connected with the cease-fire,” insist
                        that arrangements for a coalition government must be negotiated before
                        cease-fire questions can be resolved. In the U.S. view, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is in a key position, both by virtue of
                        its contacts with the Pathet Lao and in its capacity as a co-Chairman, to
                        persuade the Pathet Lao and <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                            Phouma</persName>
                        <note n="2" xml:id="d73fn2">Prince <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName>, leader of Laotian neutralists.</note> elements to
                        negotiate agreements on questions related to the cease-fire promptly in
                        order that the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> may properly discharge
                        the co-Chairmen's instructions.</p>
                    <p>3. The U.S. agreed to attend the Geneva Conference on the express
                        understanding that a properly verified cease-fire existed before the
                        Conference was convened, and it was the assumption of the United States that
                        the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> would be able to carry out its
                        continuing verification functions during the Conference in accordance with
                        the instructions of the Geneva co-Chairmen to the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. The attempt of the Pathet Lao and <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna</persName> group negotiators at Ban Namone to
                        introduce substantive discussions into the talks there as a precondition to
                        negotiations on matters pertaining to the cease-fire is preventing the
                            <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> from operating in the manner
                        contemplated.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                    <p>In 1952, the United States retaliated against long-standing Soviet
                        restrictions on the travel of American citizens in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> by requiring that Soviet officials in the
                        United States give advance notification of travel outside the immediate area
                        of New York and Washington. If the Department denied permission, the trip
                        had to be cancelled. In 1955, the requirement was extended to all Soviet
                        citizens other than those who were members of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretariat. Closed zones, modeled on those in existence in
                        the USSR, were also established. This followed adoption by the NSC of NSC

                        “restrictions should be placed upon diplomatic and official representatives
                        of Soviet bloc countries in the United States on the basis of strict
                        reciprocity for restrictions placed upon U.S. representatives in each Soviet
                        bloc country.”</p>
                    <p>On November 11, 1957, the United States proposed to the Soviet Government
                        that closed zones be abolished on the basis of reciprocity.<note n="3" xml:id="d75fn3">For text of this note, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, December 9, 1957, pp. 934-935.</note>
                        Subsequently, we have repeated that proposal several times and have also
                        suggested partial elimination, again on a reciprocal basis. The United
                        States last repeated these offers in a note of January 6, 1961<note n="4" xml:id="d75fn4">For text of this note, see ibid., January 23, 1961, pp.
                            119-120.</note> which made a number of changes in the American closed
                        zones in response to the Soviet changes announced in August 1959.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government has never replied officially to these proposals
                        although there have been unofficial intimations from Soviet officials that
                        the question was being studied. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName>'s statement to you on February 3<note n="5" xml:id="d75fn5">See <ref target="#d21">Document 21</ref>.</note> that

                        the history of the restrictions is attached (Tab B).</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
                    <p>From time to time the Department has been under public pressure to abolish or
                        reduce travel restrictions. The principal thrust of this pressure has been
                        against individual restrictions which have prevented Soviet citizens from
                        traveling to a particular area. The sources of the pressure have usually
                        been American citizens who were inconvenienced by the inability of Soviet
                        citizens to travel to their areas. There has also been a certain amount of
                        pressure from individuals and groups which feel as a matter of principle
                        that travel restrictions are alien to our way of life and should be
                        abolished entirely.</p>
                    <p>The restrictions have on occasion been the source of difficulties for us by
                        complicating the administration of the East-West Exchanges Program. Our
                        attempts to cope with the situation have bred numerous exceptions, some of
                        which we have been able to employ to gain reciprocal exemptions from the
                        Soviet side. With regard to the Soviet restrictions on our Embassy staff in
                        Moscow, however, the restrictions have been of only limited utility as a
                        bargaining tool.</p>
                    <p>It should be noted here that the Soviet authorities sometimes exercise a
                        certain amount of flexibility in permitting American exchange visitors and
                        tourists to visit areas that are formally closed. As a consequence, these
                        American visitors receive the impression that the Soviet restrictions are
                        less onerous than they actually are. Also, the recent abandonment of advance
                        censorship of the dispatches of foreign correspondents in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> indicates some sensitivity to our
                        complaints over this practice and may presage similar steps in the field of
                        travel.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> has previously
                        opposed elimination of travel restrictions for exchange visitors because of
                        his belief that important Soviet visitors are probably those most annoyed by
                        the limitations. Such visitors, he has pointed out, are in all likelihood
                        raising their influential voices against restrictions in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Ambassador has now stated, however,
                        that while up to now he has not advocated an exemption for Soviet exchange
                        visitors, he would not oppose such action and believes it might enhance our
                        overall position on exchanges with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Substantial easing of our travel restrictions at this time may call forth
                        strong protests from some parts of Congress and public opinion which may
                        express concern for its effect on security. The <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> may also oppose any significant lessening of the
                        restrictions on the grounds that this would make their counterintelligence
                        task more difficult.</p>
                    <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0179"/>
                    <p>On balance, it appears that we might gain some advantages if we could advance
                        a sufficiently dramatic proposal for reduction of restrictions that would,
                        simultaneously, protect our security interests. It is even conceivable that
                        such a proposal could prod the Soviet Government into some easing of its
                        restrictions on American travel in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. In any case, it must be admitted that our efforts over the
                        course of the past six years to use our travel restrictions as an instrument
                        with which to exert pressure for a lessening of Soviet restrictions have
                        been largely ineffective. Moreover, the passage of time has resulted in a
                        blurred impression abroad of the responsibility for the initial imposition
                        of travel restrictions. This has tended to remove any incentive the Soviet
                        Government might once have had to consider a reciprocal reduction of
                        restrictions. While we would weaken somewhat our ability to get reciprocal
                        treatment in the negotiation of exchange itineraries, this disadvantage
                        seems outweighed by the advantages.</p>
                    <p>If we should decide to withdraw some or all of our travel restrictions, there
                        are three general possibilities to be considered.</p>
                    <p>1. We could withdraw the restrictions entirely, abolishing the closed zones
                        as well as the notification requirement for Soviet officials. While this
                        would undoubtedly have the greatest advantage from the propaganda
                        standpoint, we do not believe it would succeed in inducing the Soviets
                        reciprocally to lift their restrictions and we would have lost all of our
                        leverage for protecting the ability of our officials to travel in the Soviet
                        Union. Further, we would lose all control over the travel activities of the
                        Soviet Embassy and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mission officials.</p>
                    <p>2. We could abolish closed zones for all but retain the notification
                        requirement for permanently assigned officials. This would have nearly as
                        much propaganda advantage as would lifting the restrictions altogether
                        (since it is the closed zone concept which is the most controversial aspect
                        of our travel regulations) and yet would enable us to retain effective
                        control over Soviet travel through our ability to deny any given travel
                        request under the notification system. While there would be a very slight
                        security disadvantage from the fact that there would no longer be specified
                        closed zones, it should be noted that the closed zone system offers very
                        little real security in any event as the Soviets are able to obtain
                        information through many sources, including other bloc travelers not subject
                        to closed zone regulations and from American Communist agents.</p>
                    <p>3. We could abolish the closed zones for exchange visitors and tourists but
                        retain them for officials, who would, in addition, continue to be subject to
                        the notification procedure. This would also bring some propaganda benefit,
                        and would largely remove the present friction with university and
                        exchange-minded groups. (It is true that some friction may continue in those
                        cases in which the Department decides to control <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0180"/>the itineraries of visiting Soviet nationals for security
                        or other reasons, but this should be manageable.) At the same time, it would
                        enable us to retain our present controls over the most important categories
                        of Soviets, the officials permanently assigned here, and would also probably
                        retain for us some leverage in protecting the travel of our own officials in
                        the Soviet Union. Since exchange groups travel on the basis of mutually
                        agreed itineraries, control of such travel would remain in our hands and
                        access to any part of the country could be denied if this were thought
                        desirable for security reasons. As the itineraries of Soviet tourists in the
                        United States are arranged by American travel agencies, we would also
                        maintain effective control over such travel. Soviet buyers and other
                        “businessmen” would continue to be controlled, as they are now, via the
                        advance itineraries they are required to submit.</p>
                    <p>For travel control purposes we regard Soviet correspondents, Intourist and
                        Amtorg representatives, whether or not permanently assigned, as officials.
                        They are subject to the same notification requirements as Soviet Embassy and
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mission personnel. This category also
                        includes Soviet citizens who apply for visas in order to visit Soviet
                        officials on a “personal” basis. This corresponds to the position in the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> of American correspondents,
                        American Express Company representatives and personal guests of American
                        officials.</p>
                    <p>It has been suggested that, if we decide to reduce our restrictions, we do so
                        only for a stipulated period of perhaps one year, with the understanding
                        that they would be resumed if the Soviet Government failed to respond to our
                        initiative. This appears to us seriously to reduce the impact we might
                        achieve with such an overture by casting doubt on our sincerity. At the same
                        time, it seems unlikely that it would appreciably strengthen our bargaining
                        position. Were the Soviet Government to fail to ease its own restrictions,
                        we should have to reinstitute our own with the negative political effect
                        this would have. It would seem preferable not to lift the restrictions at
                        all rather than to go through this procedure.)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion</p>
                    <p>We believe that the third alternative is the most advantageous of the three
                        and recommend your approval of it. We would retain virtually the same degree
                        of effective control over Soviet travel as we do now, while removing the
                        greatest source of friction with American groups. This alternative also
                        preserves our bargaining position on strictly official travel which may be
                        of assistance in attempting to ensure reciprocity for our officials in the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> while, at the same time, enabling
                        us to gain an important propaganda advantage. We could announce such a
                        decision as another modest but forward-looking step in the direction of more
                        normal relations with the Soviet Government and invite it to respond to our
                        initiative.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will regard the Vienna
                        talks as far more important than a probing of the President's views. In
                        discussing foreign relations in general, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will expound the Soviet line on peaceful
                        coexistence, stressing in particular the need for both sides to avoid
                        actions which could produce nuclear war and the thesis that the US must draw
                        appropriate conclusions from the growth of Soviet power. He will seek
                        specific agreements, and will expect that the conference outcome will set
                        the pattern for Soviet diplomacy for some months to come. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would prefer that the talks end
                        on a note of accord, and may make some conciliatory gestures for this
                        reason. But his attachment to this aim will depend <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0182"/>primarily on the outcome of the talks on
                        major issues. Probably <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        foremost aim will be to obtain some commitment to hold resumed negotiations
                        on Berlin and Germany. Short of a categorical rejection of any further
                        negotiations on Berlin, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        would probably be willing to accept considerably less than his optimum
                        demands on conference arrangements. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s approach to disarmament questions is less
                        predictable, but the possibility of modifications in the present rigid
                        Soviet position on a test ban agreement or general disarmament cannot be
                        excluded.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Introduction</p>
                    <p>The Vienna talks will be the culmination of a procession of Soviet
                        approaches—some made as early as last November—for a meeting between
                        Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>. This record leaves
                        little doubt of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s keen
                        interest in the meeting.</p>
                    <p>The record also contains clear pointers to the topics the Soviet leader will
                        want to discuss. He will stress the need—</p>
                    <p>(a) to arrive at an early, negotiated “interim” settlement of the Berlin
                        question,</p>
                    <p>(b) to reach an understanding on various issues relating to disarmament and
                        security,</p>
                    <p>(c) to “slow down” the arms race,</p>
                    <p>(d) to base US-Soviet relations on the principles of “peaceful coexistence”
                        Soviet style, and</p>
                    <p>(e) to expand US-Soviet trade.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may also invite the
                        President to visit the Soviet Union, and despite his intimations to the
                        contrary, may raise the questions of Cuba and Laos. And, of course, he will
                        wish to sound out President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                        as a leader, to test the man against impressions and hypotheses formed by
                        Soviet diplomats and propagandists.</p>
                    <p>While this much is clear, these matters are of such scope and elasticity that
                        they give Khrushchev considerable leeway in deciding how to play his cards.
                        Before examining these particulars, it is useful to analyze several trends
                        in Soviet policy which will have a bearing on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s approach to the conference.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Trends and Pressures in Soviet Policy</p>
                    <p>Soviet diplomacy over the past year has shown marked inconsistencies. These
                        inconsistencies have been partly the result of immediate circumstances, but
                        in almost every instance they also reflect certain deeper, inherent features
                        of present-day Soviet foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>In the first instance, “flexibility” is the hall-mark of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s style. This flexibility takes
                        shape in several ways. But most pertinent here is the tactic of alternating
                        assertive and détente phases in the expectation that the West can be induced
                        to yield positions peacefully through negotiations <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0183"/>in a period of détente by virtue of the
                        pressures that led up to it. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s handling of the Berlin issue can be explained
                        to an important degree in these terms.</p>
                    <p>Beyond this contrived ambivalence, there is also a true inconsistency in
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s diplomacy which has
                        been increasingly discernible in recent years. The implications of the
                        nuclear age, the political isolation in which Stalin's rigid policies placed
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the communist movement, and
                        internal requirements of the Soviet regime, compelled Stalin's successors to
                        develop a new look in foreign policy—a strategy based on minimizing the
                        risks of nuclear war, consolidation of Soviet holdings in Eastern Europe, a
                        paternalistic alliance (where possible) with the forces of nationalism in
                        the underdeveloped world, a generally gradualist approach to the goal of
                        bringing communist parties to power, and more open and normal state
                        relations between the West and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s acquisition of
                        a growing strategic strike force and increasing economic power have lent a
                        new, assertive impulse to Soviet policies in recent years. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> maintains that the change in the
                        world “correlation of forces” to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
                        advantage should compel the West to recognize the “reality” of irrevocable
                        communist rule in Eastern Europe, to “normalize” such anomalies as West
                        Berlin and the unrecognized status of East Germany, and to refrain from
                        “counter-revolution” (intervention) in the face of communist advances
                        outside the bloc.</p>
                    <p>Both of these trends are compatible with the Soviet understanding of that
                        elastic concept, peaceful coexistence. And <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would like to have the best of each. He seems to
                        hope that by incessant though relatively unprovocative pressures (primarily
                        political) he can consolidate and extend Soviet influence, particularly in
                        the underdeveloped world. At the same time, he seems to hope that when these
                        pressures do arouse adverse reactions, he can minimize the military risks
                        (in relations with the US) and the political liabilities (in relations with
                        nationalist neutral governments). But a harmonious blending of these
                        approaches is not always possible, even in the day-to-day functioning of
                        Soviet diplomacy. Over the long run, these two trends hold profoundly
                        different implications for Soviet relations with the free world.</p>
                    <p>Finally, even deeper contradictions flow from the dual role the Soviet
                        leaders play as rulers of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                        heads of the communist world. In the former role, their primary concerns are
                        the security and the political-economic well-being of the Soviet state. But
                        the impulses these concerns lend to Soviet policy often are circumscribed or
                        nullified by the obligations and loyalties assumed by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as center of the bloc and communist
                        movement. This factor is most conspicuous in Soviet relations with Communist
                        China, not only because of mutual obligations but <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0184"/>because Peiping's challenge from the left
                        to Soviet leadership of the communist world imposes upon the Soviet leaders
                        a need to prove their militancy if they are to hold the support of other
                        communist parties. At the heart of the matter are the conflicting national
                        interests of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China
                        (as defined by the communist rulers) and the difficulty of reconciling the
                        divergent policies and views of these two communist superpowers in a
                        political system based on the proposition that there is a single source of
                        authority and truth.</p>
                    <p>Pressures arising out of the Sino-Soviet dispute have been an important
                        consideration behind the assertiveness characterizing Soviet foreign policy
                        over the past year. They may well influence <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s behavior at Vienna. Still, Communist China by
                        no means has a veto—whether direct or indirect—over Soviet policies. In
                        recent months, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has continued to
                        pursue policies which, in several specific instances, run directly counter
                        to Chinese Communist interests.</p>
                    <p>This ambivalence is nowhere better illustrated than at the Geneva test ban
                        negotiations. There is little doubt that Moscow's desire to inhibit
                        Communist China's acquisition of nuclear weapons has been one important
                        reason why the Soviets have seriously entertained the idea of a supervised
                        nuclear test ban. And there is equally little doubt that Peiping's ambition
                        to become a nuclear power is one important reason why the prospects for a
                        test ban agreement have dimmed during the resumed session of the
                        conference.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">General Approach</p>
                    <p>Despite the agreement to keep the Vienna meeting informal, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will regard these talks as far
                        more important than a mere probing of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s views. His own position convinces him of the
                        importance of having the ear of the man in charge, and he will want to
                        impress upon the President his views as to how US-Soviet relations, and the
                        affairs of the world, should be governed. He probably will seek specific
                        agreements, if only to prove to his own audiences that his summit diplomacy
                        pays off. And he will expect that the conference outcome—both the
                        particulars and the general atmosphere—will set the pattern for the style of
                        Soviet diplomacy for some months to come.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will come to Vienna in a
                        confident mood, his confidence swelled by the events in Laos, in Cuba, and
                        in outer space, and by the general growth of Soviet power. But it would be a
                        mistake to overestimate this confidence. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s vacillation over pressing the Berlin issue
                        during the past year indicates an awareness of the potential dangers
                        involved. He might well feel that a vigorous US response to a sharp Soviet
                        challenge on Berlin would be more likely, not less so, in the wake of Cuba
                        and Laos. There is also convincing evidence of Moscow's concern over its
                        exposed position in Cuba, the growing US-Indian rapprochement, and increased
                        US defense expenditures. In addition, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0185"/>has his own problems within the
                        bloc—with Communist China and Albania—and internal problems as well. During
                        the talks, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might, for
                        effect, strike a note of anger and bluster—particularly in response to
                        strong language on sensitive issues. But it seems likely that he will
                        generally assume an attitude of reasonable firmness, coupled with a pitch
                        for improved US-Soviet relations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would prefer that the
                        talks end on a note of accord, that they convey the beginning of a new
                        period of relaxed international tensions. (However, mindful of the
                        Sino-Soviet polemics of last year, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will not be prepared to go so far in this regard
                        as he did following his talks with President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>.) In addition to other, more general,
                        considerations which are cited below, he probably believes that a détente
                        atmosphere would establish a political deterrent of sorts to forceful US
                        action against Cuba, and against Laos in the event the current negotiations
                        break down. He might also hope that this atmosphere would take some of the
                        steam out of an expanding US arms program. And, while not essential, an
                        atmosphere of US- Soviet accord would harmonize with the type of Party
                        Program Khrushchev evidently plans to present at the <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> Congress next October (which it is
                        anticipated will emphasize consumer welfare, and ultimate communist victory
                        through economic competition and peaceful coexistence).</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might be prepared to make
                        some conciliatory gestures for the sake of outward harmony; he might even
                        have “saved up” some lesser concessions for this purpose. But his attachment
                        to harmony will not be without conditions; it will depend to a large extent
                        on the outcome of the talks on the major substantive issues.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Specific Issues</p>
                    <p>Berlin and Germany. Probably <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s foremost aim will be to obtain some commitment
                        to resume negotiations on Berlin and Germany. To buttress his position, he
                        will probably reaffirm Soviet determination to conclude, if necessary, a
                        separate treaty with the East Germans, and he will not refrain from
                        generalized warnings about the consequences of such action. But he will
                        stress the Soviet Union's desire to “solve” the Berlin question peacefully,
                        through negotiations. Indeed, there is little doubt that negotiations
                        represent <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s preferred
                        approach. In the Soviet view, even a relatively limited negotiated
                        agreement—provided it left the door open for further Soviet action at some
                        future date—would be preferable to the uncertainties and potential dangers
                        of unilateral Soviet action.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will restate the maximum
                        Soviet position; the conclusion of a “two Germanies” peace treaty on the
                        basis of which West Berlin would be converted into a “free city.” If the
                        discussions delve deeper into the substance of the Soviet demands, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will probably outline a <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0186"/>proposal along the lines of the May
                        9, 1960,<note n="2" xml:id="d76fn2">For text of this Soviet proposal, see

                        containing first-step limitations on Allied rights in West Berlin and
                        designed as well to enhance the international status of the East German
                        regime. He might soften some of these provisions in an effort to induce
                        agreement on another round of negotiations.</p>
                    <p>It seems likely that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will
                        table a formal proposal for convening an East-West summit conference on
                        Berlin and Germany. If <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        meets with a categorical rejection of any further talks on Berlin, this will
                        occasion an angry response which might well set the tone for the rest of the
                        talks. Short of this, there would probably be considerable flexibility in
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s position. He would
                        like to get a firm commitment to hold a conference this year; but he would
                        be willing to settle for general agreement on a conference in the late fall
                        of this year, after the Party Congress in October. Also, he would probably
                        agree to expand the conference agenda to include other issues and he might
                        not insist on holding the conference on the summit level. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might even be satisfied with an
                        equivocal US response to the proposal for a conference of this kind.</p>
                    <p>Disarmament and Security Matters. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s approach to disarmament and related questions
                        is less predictable. He will almost certainly dwell on these matters at some
                        length, intending to set the stage for the forthcoming US-Soviet bilateral
                        talks on disarmament. He will maintain that the bilateral talks should deal
                        with matters of substance and not just procedure. He will stress, probably
                        with real conviction, the need for disarmament and for the US and Soviet
                        Union to make every effort to avoid a nuclear war. He will also express what
                        is probably a genuine concern over the possible proliferation of nuclear
                        weapons, and the burdens of the arms race. He may use the occasion of
                        privacy to indicate misgivings about Communist China's emergence as a
                        nuclear power.</p>
                    <p>But the specifics of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        future position are not clear. Regarding Moscow's current tactics at the
                        nuclear test ban talks it is unclear whether they are designed merely to
                        strengthen its bargaining position, or represent a firm decision not to
                        conclude a separate agreement on a test ban. Very likely there is some
                        indecision in the current Soviet attitude. If the Soviets have decided
                        against a test ban treaty, it is doubtful that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will so indicate directly during the Vienna
                        meeting; he would prefer to have the US assume the onus of breaking off the
                        test ban talks. (There are indications, however, that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might argue that a test ban
                        agreement, because of the extensive inspection requirements of the US and
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, will have to be related in some
                        fashion to an agreement or negotiations on broader disarmament issues.) But
                        if this decision has not been made, he may hope to bargain with the
                        President over some of the <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0187"/>remaining unresolved differences. In this case, he might agree to modify
                        the Soviet demand for a three-man directorate; there is some evidence that
                        the Soviet delegation to the test ban talks wishes to do so.</p>
                    <p>In discussing general disarmament, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will try to impress upon the President the
                        virtues of the Soviet single-treaty approach to “general and complete
                        disarmament.” He may stick rigidly to the Soviet position that this approach
                        must be the basis for any resumed negotiations on general disarmament. But
                        he may wish to sound out the President about the possibility of negotiations
                        on what he must realize to be a more realistic disarmament package proposal,
                        particularly one geared to the “Nth country” problem. Such a proposal could
                        take the form of a separately negotiable “first-stage” agreement linked in
                        only a declaratory sense to the goal of general and complete disarmament.
                        Or, the Soviets might propose that negotiations on complete disarmament be
                        conducted parallel with talks on other proposals. In any event, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would probably be interested in
                        hearing whatever new ideas the US may have concerning measures to check the
                        spread of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>Peaceful Coexistence. In this first encounter with the President, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> should be particularly disposed
                        to expound the Soviet philosophy on East-West relations. This will include,
                        at a minimum, the standard line on peaceful coexistence: that the existence
                        of two world systems is an established fact; that these two systems must
                        resolve their differences and prove which is superior through peaceful,
                        economic means, and not by wars between states; that there can be no
                        interference in the affairs of another state (i.e., the West must respect
                        the authority of established communist regimes); but that there can be no
                        cessation of the ideological struggle (i.e., communist subversion), as this
                        is an objective law of history transcending the level of relations between
                        states.</p>
                    <p>But <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will go beyond this
                        familiar dialectical rationalization of imperialist intent and self-survival
                        in the nuclear age. He will wish to establish the thesis that the US must
                        draw appropriate conclusions from the growth of Soviet power. In particular,
                        he will maintain that the West's acceptance of the permanence and legitimacy
                        of the satellite regimes of Eastern Europe is a sina qua non of tranquil
                        East-West relations. He will present parallel arguments for a “solution” of
                        the West Berlin problem.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may not choose to bring up
                        the question of Cuba, but if he does, he will probably raise it in
                        connection with these connotations of peaceful coexistence. If so, he will
                        warn the President of the dangers to peace involved in armed intervention in
                        Cuba. But <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will be careful
                        to avoid any embarrassing, specific commitment to render <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> all-out military support. Instead, he
                        will take the line presented in his letter <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0188"/>of April 22<note n="3" xml:id="d76fn3">For text, see ibid.,
                            1961-1963, vol. VI, pp. 10-16.</note> that US intervention in Cuba could
                        justifiably, and might well, provoke similar action by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> along its periphery. Realizing Soviet
                        inability to give <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>'s Cuba
                        effective military support short of running grave risks of nuclear war
                        (which in the final analysis he would have no intention of doing), <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will concentrate on maximizing
                        the political price for any overt US action.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will probably maintain
                        that as another consequence of the growth of Soviet power, the communist
                        bloc should have a voice equal to that of the West in international
                        councils. The question of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
                        “troika” proposal for administering international organizations will
                        inevitably arise in this connection, or in connection with the test ban
                        talks. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might vociferously
                        voice his determination to press this proposal until it is fully accepted.
                        But it would be a mistake to assume that the Soviet position on this
                        question is immovable. The Soviets almost certainly expect this fight to be
                        lengthy—one that will require compromises along the road if it is to be
                        successful. And they will be prepared in the end to abandon their extreme
                        demand if they become convinced that it will antagonize rather than win the
                        neutralists to their side. To date, the Soviets have been notably
                        unsuccessful in securing neutralist support—which is essential—for this
                        proposal.</p>
                    <p>Laos. Apart from probable cautions concerning the consequences of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> intervention in Laos, any points
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> chooses to raise
                        regarding the Laotian situation will be conditioned by the course of
                        negotiations in Geneva and Ban Namone. For this reason, an estimate now of
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s position on this
                        major issue is particularly imprudent.</p>
                    <p>There is a possibility that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        might concede one or two non-essential points on the Laotian question (the
                        Soviets have a fair amount of leeway) if he were pressed and felt that such
                        concessions would promote an amicable outcome of the Vienna conference.</p>
                    <p>Other Issues. On his own initiative, or in response to US initiatives
                        regarding other US-Soviet bilateral issues, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might well raise the various standing Soviet
                        proposals for expanded economic relations—in particular, the extension of US
                        credits and most-favored-nation treatment to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Unless the talks take an acrimonious turn, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might seek to promote an atmosphere of accord by
                        making some conciliatory gesture on a lesser issue. He might agree to a US
                        initiative on bilateral relations, retool some earlier US proposal on
                        bilateral cooperation in scientific or medical endeavors (though probably
                        not in the exploration of outer space), or invite President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> to visit the Soviet Union (though
                        the <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> Congress and the Berlin question
                        would pose vexing problems of timing to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>).</p>
                    <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0189"/>
                    <p>Finally, with the eyes of the world on Vienna, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might regard the meeting as an appropriate
                        occasion for some dramatic step intended to demonstrate Soviet progress or
                        peaceful intent. This might mean a new space shot; and it is another reason
                        for some Soviet initiative in the field of disarmament.</p>

                        telephone connection between the State Department and the United States
                        Embassy in Moscow if the Soviet Government has no objection. This telephone
                        would permit direct communication between the heads of the United States and
                        Soviet governments without being ostensibly and exclusively designed for
                        this purpose. Such communication might be useful, in a grave crisis, in
                        reducing the risk of war by miscalculation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has in the past indicated
                        that he favored a “white telephone” between the United States President and
                        himself, in order to reduce the risk of war by miscalculation. This
                        telephone connection could serve the same purpose, without creating as many
                        political problems.</p>
                    <p>This discussion might afford you an opportunity to avert to the broader
                        question of the risk of war by miscalculation, and to the fact that this
                        risk may be of some significance during the next few years, when the
                        advantage accruing to a first strike could lead to a pre-emptive strike if
                        one side thought that the other was about to attack.</p>
                    <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0190"/>
                    <p>There is little evidence that this problem has yet figured prominently in
                        Soviet thinking about arms control. It may be useful to get <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to thinking about the problem
                        and about the need for remedial measures. This might possibly increase the
                        chance of progress in any later discussions of such measures with the
                        Soviets. A sober view of this risk might also help him to appreciate the
                        risks that he will be accepting if he initiates further aggressive moves in
                        the period immediately ahead.</p>

                        May 26, 1961, Deputy Special Assistant for National Security Affairs
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> stated that it was his
                        view that “the Viet-Nam situation is extremely dangerous to the peace and
                        that we must push on all fronts to force a deflation of that crisis before
                        it builds to a situation like that in Laos. If it comes to an open battle,
                        the inhibitions on our going in will be less than in Laos; but the challenge
                        to Russia and China will be even greater.” <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> noted that the United States was working on two
                        fronts: “to build <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>'s strength”
                        and “to heighten the awareness of the international community about the
                        border issue and to make the ICC the focus of the Laos conference.” But,
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> continued, “a third front
                        on which we must work is Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> himself. Thus my efforts to get the town to focus

                        have effect of improving atmosphere and relations. I find it extremely
                        difficult however to imagine what this could be. Some change in attitude on
                        Laos problem is possibility since quite possible Soviets consider neutral
                        Laos at this time desirable from their point of view. Slight possibility

                        our bases and activities on Soviet periphery.</p>
                    <p>With respect Laos best agreement we can hope to get will apparently rest on
                        shaky foundations. At appropriate time and possibly during President's talk
                        would be advisable my opinion attempt put on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> responsibility for seeing that Laos in fact
                        remains neutral and that this will be gauge of over-all Soviet intentions.
                        Unless and until there is radical deterioration of our relations believe
                        this could have real value as domination Laos itself not major Soviet
                        interest particularly in view Chinese angle.</p>
                    <p>Believe Soviets will be concerned about moves of administration in arms field

                        this with his action to demobilize substantial number Soviet troops.</p>

                        quote President in order stir up controversy in US. President might take
                        line that flight was major error particularly timing thereof, but that
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> apparently does not
                        realize extent to which Soviet secrecy caused concern over Soviet intentions
                        to those responsible for US security.</p>

                            Air Marshal Constantin A. Vershinin had been under discussion during the
                            spring of 1961 without resolution. While the Department of State favored
                            it, the Department of Defense in a letter of April 5 stressed the
                            negative aspects of such a visit. (Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, July 3; ibid., 033.6111/7-361) On July 9 Secretary

                    </p>
                    <p>This paper seeks to set forth certain lines of approach both general and
                        specific which would offer the best possibility of getting through to <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0193"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and enhancing in his mind
                        the creditability of United States positions. It seeks to eliminate emphasis
                        on aspects of Soviet policy and its relation with the non-communist world,
                        which experience has shown is without value and apt to be detrimental to the
                        purposes we seek in this meeting.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. General</p>
                    <p>The emphasis throughout should be placed upon the Soviet foreign policy in
                        its national aspects and any ideological topics or reference to the general
                        threat of communism in the world should not be dealt with per se but as a
                        function of and in relation to Soviet state policy.</p>
                    <p>The United States and the Soviet Union as chief protagonists in the present
                        world-wide struggle, find themselves in antagonistic confrontation in regard
                        to every international political problem. This is most certainly the Soviet
                        view which treats every issue as a battle in a continuing struggle in which
                        negotiation is not sought by the Soviet Government for the purpose of
                        solution of a given problem, but as a weapon in political warfare to obtain
                        a Soviet or communist victory at the expense of the non-communist world.</p>
                    <p>There is only one major subject on which there would appear to be a
                        coincident of interest between the United States and the Soviet Union, and
                        that is on the assumed common desire of both to avoid nuclear war. Community
                        of interest on this point should be the basic and starting point of the
                        entire approach to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. On the
                        basis of this common desire to avoid nuclear war, the United States and the
                        Soviet Union, as the two leading powers in the world, have an enormous
                        responsibility in the matter of the preservation of peace. While recognizing
                        that we will not find any genuine common ground in regard to most if not all
                        of the international issues in dispute, the manner in which these
                        disagreements are handled in practice should be approached in the light of
                        our common interest in avoiding nuclear war and in our great responsibility
                        as world powers.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. War</p>
                    <p>It should be emphasized to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        that the artificial distinction between the three categories of war,
                        contained in his January sixth speech and the eighty-one Party document, is
                        inherently artificial and dangerous. The thesis that certain kinds of war
                        can be segregated out from others is a most dangerous thesis. In reality,
                        war is war and does not lend itself to such tidy compartmentalization. Any
                        form of armed action supported by a great power carries with it the obvious
                        danger of spreading, and thereby moving from one category to another.
                        Support by the Soviet Union of “wars of national liberalization”—an
                        extremely flexible definition at best—is entirely incompatible with the
                        professed Soviet desire for peaceful co-existence.</p>
                    <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0194"/>
                    <p>While <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will probably not be
                        too receptive to anything to do with the United Nations, nonetheless the
                        only ground rules for co-existence which exist in a jointly agreed document
                        are in the Charter itself, which specifically binds its signatories to
                        refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force,
                        except in individual or collective self-defense, and to settle their
                        international disputes by peaceful means. It should be pointed out that the
                        attempt to advance the communist cause by small internal wars, i.e. wars of
                        national liberation, is a certain path towards world war if consistently
                        followed, in the state of the world today. This is the logic of any such
                        Soviet position and no amount of tactical skill or self-deception could
                        obscure this reality.</p>
                    <p>The United States is a great power, and the Soviet Union is a great power.
                        The United States is very cognizant of this fact and does not and will not
                        seek to confront a great power, i.e. the Soviet Union, with a series of
                        intolerable choices which would involve either the acceptance of
                        international political defeat, or the recourse to war as a means of
                        averting it. The Soviet Union, for its part, should recognize the same
                        reality in regard to the United States. Quite apart from the subjective will
                        of its leaders, it is not realistic to believe that a great power can accept
                        a succession of attempted or actual political defeats without at some point
                        in the process having recourse to its great power. While concentrating on
                        the responsibilities and interests of the Soviet Union as a great power, at
                        some point in the discussion the duality of Soviet operations in the foreign
                        field should be brought out, but only, as indicated above, as the function
                        of or in relation to its national policy. Reference should be made, in this
                        connection, to the incompatibility between the public utterances of
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> as the leader of the
                        Soviet State and the positions taken and the views expressed in his January
                        sixth speech as head of the dominant party in the world communist movement,
                        with particular reference in the latter document to the violent and
                        distorted statements of hostility towards the United States as a country. On
                        specific issues, the following line of approach is suggested:</p>
                    <p>a) Germany and Berlin</p>
                    <p>Stemming from the general considerations outlined above, it could be said to
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that he should not
                        expect that the United States and its allies would accept the political
                        defeat involved in the loss or weakening of their existing position in
                        Berlin. We have firm obligations and solemn commitments in this matter and
                        to give them up or to permit them to be eroded would constitute a political
                        defeat in Europe, which would be quite intolerable and unacceptable to a
                        great power, no matter what the consequences. It should be pointed out that
                        the entire situation in Germany is abnormal, that that of Berlin as a city
                        is abnormal, and that we cannot accept the characterization of one part of
                        an abnormal situation as its sole abnormality. <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0195"/>The situation in Germany has existed since the end of the
                        war, and while unsatisfactory to all concerned, any change would have to be
                        an improvement, or at least no worse, from the point of view of all
                        concerned—the Western allies, the people of West Berlin, as well as the
                        Soviet and East German side. In a situation as delicately balanced as the
                        situation in Germany, the side which seeks to change it to its advantage and
                        to the detriment of the other side is the one that assumes the
                        responsibility for the risks to peace inherent in such a course of
                        action.</p>
                    <p>The standard Soviet argument concerning the necessity of doing away with the
                        “vestiges of the war” is obviously a formalistic statement of the position
                        and cannot be accepted. The real vestige of the war to be corrected is the
                        division of Germany, but since this realistically does not seem to be an
                        immediate possibility, the delicate balance should not be upset. If ways of
                        improving the situation without detriment to any of the parties concerned
                        could be found, we would be prepared to consider any such suggestion. The
                        proposal for a “free West Berlin” does not satisfy these criteria, since it
                        would appear to make very little sense, even from a Soviet point of view,
                        unless it brought them certain advantages with corresponding disadvantages
                        to the Western Powers and the people of West Berlin, which would not be
                        tolerable for the reasons given above.</p>
                    <p>One possibility might be to return to the '44 agreement and to see if the
                        statute then outlined for all Berlin could not be reinstituted with certain
                        agreed modifications. One other course of action would be, if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> feels he must proceed with a
                        peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, to do so leaving
                        unchanged the obligations of the Four Powers in regard to West Berlin. We
                        would not subscribe to such a peace treaty, but its conclusion leaving West
                        Berlin in statu quo might be a possibility.</p>
                    <p>b) Disarmament</p>
                    <p>It would be well to focus the disarmament discussion on the current test ban
                        negotiations since these are the only actual negotiations in progress in
                        this field which, theoretically at least, should offer a prospect for
                        agreement. The chief obstacle for agreement at the present time is the
                        retrogression by the Soviet side in introducing the doctrine of a
                        Three-Power Committee with individual veto power in place of a single
                        administrator selected for his objectivity as an international civil
                        servant.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> should be questioned on
                        this point as to how any such mechanism could possibly operate, since a veto
                        power would render ineffective, and indeed ridiculous, the entire concept of
                        an objective system of international verification and control. He should be
                        pushed hard to justify the workability of any such mechanism. Care, however,
                        should be exercised that this point is not built up to a degree whereby a
                        Soviet retreat from this position might be utilized by them to justify major
                        concessions on our part in other aspects of the test ban talks still in
                        dispute.</p>
                    <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0196"/>
                    <p>If, however, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> sticks firmly
                        to his insistence on the troika and endeavors to transfer it into the
                        general field of disarmament, he should be told that there seems to be
                        little prospect of any fruitful progress in this entire field as long as
                        this position is maintained. However, in all likelihood, he will not seek to
                        extend the troika principle into general disarmament, but is more apt to
                        stress the standard Soviet position that when disarmament is fully or even
                        substantially achieved, the Soviet Government would accept any form of
                        inspection. If he makes this latter point clear, then the discussion of
                        general disarmament should follow along the lines of our position paper
                            (<gloss target="#t_PMK1">PMK</gloss>-B/9).<note n="2" xml:id="d80fn2">Not printed. (Ibid., CF 1905)</note>

                    <p>In general, the impression we would desire to leave on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is first of all one of utmost
                        seriousness in regard to the current world situation; the desire of the
                        United States to find means to handle our disagreements in such a way as to
                        avoid war and that, to this end, realistic and responsible action on the
                        part of the Soviet Union will be matched by equal responsible and realistic
                        action on the part of the United States; that world peace cannot be
                        preserved by an attempt to inflict political defeats upon great powers and
                        our reciprocal actions should be governed by some form of ground rules in
                        order to avoid the type of actions which can set off an automatic chain of
                        events leading to the end that both countries desire to avoid.</p>

                        expectations and hopes with which we are approaching it.</p>
                    <p>I do not share frequently stated view that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> needs to be personally assured at this time of
                        our determination to resist any overt encroachment that would bring into
                        play our obligation under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or existing
                        alliances. He is well acquainted with our situation in these respects and
                        knows that we will not hesitate to react with determination if challenged in
                        this manner. He does not, I am sure, propose to offer us such challenges, if
                        he can help it, particularly such as would threaten to embroil us directly
                        with Soviet forces. Whatever pressures he may be planning to exert on US in
                        Berlin in coming period, they are not likely to be ones which, in his
                        opinion, would present us with an overt and clear challenge of this
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>It would not be useful for me to attempt to enter at this date into
                        discussion of our positions on those great questions, such as Germany,
                        Berlin, Korea-Japan, et cetera, in which Russian interests and our own are
                        both normally involved, which constitute in my view center and source of
                        deepest tensions. On other hand, I am skeptical of usefulness of any
                        detailed discussion with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        of peripheral situations such as Laos, Cuba, and Iran. Soviet responsibility
                        as a rule is not formally involved in these situations; and where Soviet
                        policies have contributed to their exacerbation, these have been only one of
                        many factors.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me evident that decisions of eighty-one parties meeting in Moscow
                        last fall rested on agreed calculation, as between Russians and Chinese,
                        that America's world position and influence could probably be effectively
                        shattered in coming period, and the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        group politically isolated by series of sharp indirect political pressures,
                        ruthless exploitation of colonial issue, and all-out propaganda attack. I
                        think it could usefully be emphasized to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that a political program founded on such
                        calculation is not only wholly inconsistent with any attempt to improve
                        international atmosphere but could scarcely be expected to achieve
                        completion without at some point creating situations where our military
                        obligations would become involved and complications created beyond anyone's
                        control. It could be justly put to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that inflammatory and insulting language in which
                        recent Soviet statements have been cast constitutes alone a grievous
                        disservice to any efforts to improve world situation and plays directly into
                        hands of those who view with disfavor or despair the prospect of any
                        improvement in Soviet-American relations.</p>
                    <p>In light of above, it seems to me general tenor of President's approach could
                        well be that (1) basic political problems dividing us from Russians and
                        Chinese in European and East-Asian areas, outside of disarmament, are of
                        such difficulty that much time and patient preparation of public opinion
                        would be involved before any practical negotiating approach <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0198"/>could be made to their solutions; (2) we
                        would like to start on the long task of cultivating a suitable atmosphere
                        and climate of opinion in which to tackle these questions; but (3) it is
                        idle to attempt this in face of the impressions recently created by violent
                        Russian statements, by obvious attempt to destroy United Nations
                        Secretariat, and by equally obvious effort to exploit colonial and other
                        issues with a view to blackening American image before world public,
                        distorting American action and intentions, and sowing hatred and mistrust of
                        American people.</p>
                    <p>Though aware that my views in this respect are at variance with those of many
                        prominent American students of Soviet scene within and without government, I
                        have still not seen evidence to convince me that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is an absolute dictator of policy within the
                        Communist orbit or that he does not have to take into account views of other
                        people and parties. Do not believe that hints transmitted to us from time to
                        time along this line (most recently to me personally by Soviet Ambassador
                        here, yesterday) are wholly without substance. I think <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has, for various reasons, a
                        greater interest in relaxation of tensions between Russia and the West than
                        have his Chinese allies; that it was not without inner hesitations and
                        conflicts that he was led last fall to accept the aggressive Chinese line on
                        spreading of socialism by means short of all-out war; and that he could well
                        use some help from outside in arguing for a somewhat more moderate and
                        prudent course on part of communist parties. For this reason, I hope his
                        personal position, and possible effects of Vienna talks on it, will not be
                        left out of our consideration as we plan our approach to the meeting.</p>
                    <p>From the particular vantage point of Belgrade, it is evident that
                        noncommitted world now stand at very crucial parting of the ways. If some
                        relaxation of over-all world tensions is not achieved, it seems to me very
                        likely that there will be serious split between that group of unaligned
                        nations which is violently anti-Western and anti-American and that which
                        would like to preserve decent relations with the West. This issue may be at
                        stake in forthcoming Cairo meeting. To extent that Vienna meeting creates
                        impression of improvement of Soviet-Western relations, Yugoslavia, whose
                        influence together with that of Nehru <note n="3" xml:id="d81fn3">
                            Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India.</note> may be decisive in
                        determining trends within the nonaligned group, will be cautioned against
                        association with anti-Western tendencies. If, however, no improvement in
                        East-West relations is achieved at this time, position of Yugoslavia and
                        other neutrals may be expected to become more difficult; and in this case,
                        as things now stand, there would be small hope of drawing this country
                        generally to the pro-Western camp.</p>

                    <p>Following his meetings with President <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> in Paris, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> arrived in Vienna at 10:45 a.m. on June 3, 1961.
                        After a ceremonial meeting with Austrian President Schaerf the President and
                        Secretary of State went to the U.S. Embassy residence for the first meeting
                        with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, who had
                        arrived in Vienna the previous day. This meeting lasted until 1:30 p.m. when
                        the President hosted a luncheon for the Chairman at the residence. Following
                        lunch the President again met with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, while <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                        and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> met
                        separately. These sessions ended shortly before 7 p.m. in order to allow
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and the Chairman to prepare for a State
                        dinner given by the Austrian Government and attended by the First Ladies.
                        Records of the two formal meetings, the luncheon discussion, and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s conversation with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> are printed as <ref target="#d83">Documents 83</ref>-<ref target="#d86">86</ref>.</p>
                    <p>On June 4 the President and the Chairman met at the Soviet Chancery from
                        10:15 to 1 p.m. during which the President was given aide-memoires on
                        disarmament and Germany and Berlin. Following lunch at the Soviet Chancery,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> met again at 3:15 for about 15 minutes. For

                    </list>
                    <p>The President said he wanted to express his pleasure at seeing Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and recalled his
                        earlier meeting in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s visit in the United
                        States. The President said that he had talked to the Soviet Foreign Minister
                        and the Soviet Ambassador and that he was extremely interested in discussing
                        at least to a certain extent matters affecting the relations between the two
                        countries. He said he hoped that during these two days a better
                        understanding of the problems confronting us could be reached, and that the
                        conversations would be useful.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he also
                        wished the conversations to be useful. He remembered the meeting in the
                        Foreign Relations Committee <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0201"/>and
                        said that the President had been late for that meeting, so that there was no
                        opportunity to say much except hello and goodbye. He also recalled that he
                        had told the President that he had heard of him as a young and promising man
                        in politics. He was glad now to meet him as President.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that he also remembered this remark and said that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had told him that he
                        was very youthful in appearance. The President remarked that he must have
                        aged since then.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wondered whether he had
                        really said that. Normally he did not say such things because young people
                        want to look older and older people like to look younger. He said that he
                        had had a similar experience because in his youth he had looked much younger
                        than his age and had regarded it as offensive if someone made a mistake
                        about his age. However, he obtained a kind of mandate of old age by
                        beginning to gray at the age of twenty-two. In any event, if he could he
                        would be happy to share his years with the President or change places with
                        him.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that as President, bearing heavy responsibilities just
                        as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> as leader of his
                        country, he was concerned about how it would be possible for the two
                        countries—allied with other countries, having different political and social
                        systems, and competing with each other in different parts of the world—to
                        find during his Presidency ways and means of not permitting situations where
                        the two countries would be committed to actions involving their security or
                        endangering peace, to secure which is our basic objective.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that the Soviet
                        Union had endeavored for a long time to develop friendly relations with the
                        United States and its allies. Such relations would bring about peace and
                        would be in the interest of the two countries and the world at large. At the
                        same time the Soviet Union did not wish to reach agreement with the U.S. at
                        the expense of other peoples because such agreement would not mean peace.
                        Several basic questions must be resolved. Without their solution sources of
                        tension between the two countries would continue to exist. Such solutions
                        are all the more necessary because the Soviet Union believes that the
                        situations of the two countries do not impel them to clash with each other.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that what he had
                        in mind was primarily the economic field, which was basic. The United States
                        is a rich country and has all the necessary resources. So far, the Soviet
                        Union has been poorer than the United States and it recognizes that fact.
                        However, the Soviet Union will develop—not at U.S. expense, because it has
                        no predatory intentions, but rather by developing its own human and natural
                        resources. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that
                        he did not want to conceal that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        was challenging the United States; it wants to become richer than the United
                        States and this is not just a desire but there is some real foundation for
                            <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0202"/>such a development. The U.S.
                        may not agree with this but then the U.S. can also develop further. In any
                        event, it is necessary to suppress any feeling of envy, if it exists. The
                        Soviet Union does not wish to stand in the way of U.S. economic
                        development.</p>
                    <p>The President remarked that he was impressed with the rate of growth in the
                        Soviet Union and said that this was surely a source of satisfaction to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, as it was to us.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that the West and
                        the U.S. as its leader must recognize one fact: Communism exists and has won
                        its right to develop. Such recognition should be de facto and not de jure.
                        United States policy under Dulles excluded such possibility; Mr. Dulles had
                        based his policy on the premise of liquidation of the Communist system. This
                        struggle against Communism would of course never lead to the establishment
                        of good relations between our two countries. The existence of the Soviet
                        system does not depend on the United States just as the existence of the
                        capitalist system does not depend on the Soviet Union. Relations between our
                        two countries could develop only if this fact is recognized. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he had raised this
                        point not for the purpose of arguing. He would not try to convince the
                        President about the advantages of Communism, just as the President should
                        not waste his time to convert him to capitalism. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> repeated that the recognition he
                        had referred to should be de facto.</p>
                    <p>The President said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s remarks raised a very important problem. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> disagreed with the
                        interpretation of the policy ascribed by him to Dulles, who, according to
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, had sought to
                        eliminate Communist control in areas under such control, and says that this
                        represents failure to recognize Communism as a fact in that area. His own
                        interpretation of the situation was, the President continued, that the
                        Soviet Union was seeking to eliminate free systems in areas that are
                        associated with us. So while objecting to efforts directed at eliminating
                        Communism in areas under the Communist system, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> appears to believe that it is
                        appropriate to exert efforts to eliminate free systems. This is a matter of
                        very serious concern to us.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that this was an
                        incorrect interpretation of Soviet policy. The Soviet Union is against
                        implanting its policy in other states. As a matter of fact, this would be an
                        impossible task. What the Soviet Union says is that Communism will triumph.
                        This is a different proposition because it represents a teaching, a
                        scientific analysis of social development. The United States may not accept
                        this teaching, but the Soviet Union proceeds from one assumption alone,
                        namely, that any change in the social system should depend on the will of
                        the peoples themselves. The Soviet Union is for change. It believes that it
                        is now in the political arena and it is challenging the capitalist system
                        just as that system had challenged feudalism in the past. The French
                        Revolution was <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0203"/>the first instance
                        where such challenge was made. The response to the French Revolution was the
                        creation of the Holy Alliance, which failed, primarily because Russia was
                        its leader. In those days Russia was a feudalist state, but now it is a
                        Communist country. The Soviet Union has proposed general and complete
                        disarmament. This is a manifestation of its intention not to use arms. The
                        Soviet Union believes that human minds will develop and it believes in its
                        system, just as the President believes in its own system. In any event this
                        is not a matter for argument, much less for war.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he believed that the most important problem for the
                        two sides was to have some understanding of their respective views on the
                        differences that exist. Such understanding would explain the actions of the
                        two sides as distinct from what their interpretation might be otherwise. Our
                        position is that people should have free choice. In some cases minorities
                        seize control in areas associated with us, minorities which do not express
                        the will of the people. Such groups associate themselves with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and act against the interests of the
                        United States. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> believes that this
                        is a historical inevitability. This is a matter of concern to us because we
                        do not believe that this is a historical inevitability. This brings in
                        conflict the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as center of Communist
                        power and the US as center of our power. Thus the problem is how to conduct
                        this disagreement in areas where we have interests without direct
                        confrontation of the two countries and thus to serve the interests of our
                        people. The President said that his interest here was to explain our concern
                        about what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> says is an
                        inevitability. We cannot regard this to be an inevitability. We believe in
                        our system just as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        believes in his.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that this was
                        correct but wondered whether the United States wanted to build a dam
                        preventing the development of human mind and conscience. To do such a thing
                        is not in man's power. The Spanish Inquisition burned people who disagreed
                        with it but ideas did not burn and eventually came out as victors. Thus if
                        we start struggling against ideas, conflicts and clashes between the two
                        countries will be inevitable. Once an idea is born it cannot be chained or
                        burned. History should be the judge in the argument between ideas. People
                        will judge capitalism and Communism by the results of their respective
                        efforts. If capitalism insures better living for people it will win.
                        Conversely, if Communism achieves this goal, it will be the winner. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he wanted to
                        emphasize that what he had in mind was victory of ideas, not a military
                        victory. In any event, the military aspect has become unimportant today.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed his belief that his and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s obligation to the peoples of
                        the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> respectively was to
                        have this struggle for ideas, which is part of our times, conducted without
                        affecting <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0204"/>the vital security
                        interests of the two countries. The Soviet Union as a national entity has
                        certain essential interests. The same is true of the United States. The
                        struggle in other areas should be conducted in a way which would not involve
                        the two countries directly and would not affect their national interest or
                        prestige. As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> knows
                        from history—and this, the President said, he had discussed with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>—it is very easy to involve
                        countries in certain actions. We might get involved in a struggle which
                        would affect the peace of the world and the interests of our peoples.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he hoped that
                        he had misunderstood the President's remarks. He wanted to seek
                        clarification of whether the President wanted to place the responsibility
                        for the development of Communist ideas on the Soviet Union. Did the
                        President want to say that Communism should exist only in those countries
                        that are already Communist and that if Communist ideas should develop the
                        U.S. would be in conflict with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>?
                        Such an understanding of the situation is incorrect, and if there really is
                        such an understanding, conflicts will be inevitable. Ideas do not belong to
                        any one nation and they cannot be retracted. Marx and Engels were the
                        originators of Communist ideas; even if the originators of ideas were to
                        reject their own ideas, the ideas once born would continue to develop. There
                        is no immunization against ideas. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> continued by saying that if he should renounce
                        Communism—something he has no intention of doing—his friends would exclude
                        him from their group but the idea would continue developing. De facto
                        recognition of the two main ideas—although some other ideas may develop—is
                        essential for the peaceful development of the world. Ideas should be
                        propagated without the use of arms or interference in the internal affairs
                        of other states. If Communist ideas should spread in other countries, the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be happy, just as the US
                        would be glad if capitalist ideas were to spread. In any event, the spread
                        of ideas should depend on peoples alone. Ideas should not be borne on
                        bayonets or on missile warheads, bayonets now being obsolete. This would
                        mean war and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> does not accept such
                        a situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that
                        he would guarantee that the USSR would not exceed the bounds of this
                        professed policy, namely, that ideas would not be imposed by war.</p>
                    <p>The President interjected that Mao Tse-tung had said that power was at the
                        end of the rifle.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that he did not
                        believe that Mao Tse-tung could have said this. Mao Tse-tung is a Marxist
                        and Marxists have always been against war. A vivid example of this position
                        is the fact that during the Russo-Japanese war Plekhanov, leader of Russian
                        Social Democrats in those days, embraced Kotoyama, leader of the Japanese
                        Socialists, as a sign of friendship between peoples. Kotoyama was a
                        prominent leader <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0205"/>of Japanese
                        Socialists and he died in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in 1935
                        or 1936 as a very old man.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he understood Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s point of view but that he was anxious to give
                        him our views. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        belief in the inevitability of the spread of Communism is well known. The
                        President said that he would try to explain how we view the situation so as
                        to make it easier to understand our actions and motivations. Our basic
                        objective should be preservation of peace and if we fail in that effort both
                        our countries will lose. Our two countries possess modern weapons while
                        other countries do not posses such weapons. West Europe suffered a great
                        deal during the war but now it has risen again and is prospering. However,
                        if our two countries should miscalculate they would lose for a long time to
                        come. Thus, his own views notwithstanding, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> should consider our views on the development of
                        the world so that the chances of peace should be increased and our peoples
                        would not stand a loss. His own main ambition, the President said, is to
                        secure peace.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> responded by saying
                        that he had often seen similar statements in the US press. Miscalculation,
                        he said, was a very vague term. However, it looked to him as if the United
                        States wanted the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to sit like a school
                        boy with his hands on his desk. The Soviet Union supports its ideas and
                        holds them in high esteem. It cannot guarantee that these ideas will stop at
                        its borders. He said that he did not quite understand what kind of
                        conditions, in US view, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should
                        maintain in order to ensure peace. He wondered what the meaning of the term
                        “miscalculation” was. He said the Soviet Union would defend its vital
                        interests and the United States might regard some of such acts as
                        “miscalculation”. However, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        believes in defending its interests. Moreover, the same term could be used
                        by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> with regard to some actions by
                        the other side. In any event, the West has been using this term much too
                        often. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is not a militant country
                        and it does not want war, but it cannot be intimated either. To use this
                        term “miscalculation”, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        said, it would be irresponsible to make a miscalculation, regardless of
                        which of the two sides did it. Both would lose equally and would be punished
                        equally. Modern war would not be like World War I or II. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> appreciates this fact just as the United
                        States does. The term “miscalculation” should be stored away, particularly
                        since its use by the West does not affect the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> at all.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he wanted to explain what he meant by
                        “miscalculation”. He said it was impossible to predict the next move of any
                        country. As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> knows,
                        history shows that it is extremely difficult to make a judgment as to what
                        other countries would do next. The Soviet Union has surely experienced this,
                        just as the United States has. Western Europe has suffered a great deal
                        because of its failure <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0206"/>to foresee
                        with precision what other countries would do. Such failure has not been
                        limited to other countries alone. Just recently, the President continued, he
                        had mentioned certain misjudgments by the United States. An example of such
                        misjudgments were certain actions by the United States in connection with
                        the Korean situation, where the United States had failed to foresee what the
                        Chinese would do. However, misjudgment can be avoided and the purpose of
                        this meeting is to introduce precision in judgments of the two sides and to
                        obtain a clearer understanding of where we are going.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he agreed with
                        this and this was how he too regarded the meeting. The purpose of this
                        conversation was not to worsen but to improve the relations between the two
                        countries and if the President and himself should succeed in this effort,
                        the expenses incurred in connection with the meeting would be well
                        justified. On the other hand, if they should fail, not only the expenses
                        would not be justified, but—what is much more important—the hopes of the
                        peoples would be frustrated.</p>
                    <p>At this point the group moved to the dining room for lunch.</p>

                    <p>During lunch the conversation was mostly of a social nature. The points of
                        significance that emerged were the following:</p>
                    <p>(1) During the discussion of the history of the Laotian Conference, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that the
                        conference had found a good solution for Viet Nam and said that perhaps the
                        same would happen this time.</p>
                    <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0207"/>
                    <p>(2) In discussing agricultural problems in the Soviet Union, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> stressed the need for a great
                        increase in their chemical production so as to ensure sufficient quantities
                        of chemical fertilizers, herbicides, etc. He also mentioned that about 25 to
                        30% of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s population were engaged
                        in agriculture. He also implied that he had direct channels of communication
                        to Mr. Garst, who had denied a statement Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had made to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> about the development of dwarf corn
                        in the United States.</p>
                    <p>(3) With reference to Gagarin's flight,<note n="2" xml:id="d84fn2">A
                            reference to Major Yuri Gagarin's orbital flight of the earth in
                            April.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said
                        that prior to the launching there were many unknown factors, particularly
                        with regard to the psychological effects of such flights on human beings.
                        Prior to the flight there was some fear of entrusting Gagarin with the
                        controls of the space craft. Nevertheless, he was given the controls but the
                        instructions were coded and sealed in an envelope. The code was developed in
                        such a way as to make sure that only a normal person could decode it. Now
                        everything is known: Gagarin has made his flight, and he sang songs while in
                        orbit.</p>
                    <p>(4) With regard to the possibility of launching a man to the moon, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he was
                        cautious because of the military aspect of such flights. In response to the
                        President's inquiry whether the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should go to the moon together, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> first said no, but then said
                        “all right, why not?”</p>
                    <p>(5) In raising his glass to the health of his guest, the President expressed
                        satisfaction that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was
                        here at the American Embassy. He recalled Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s visit to the United States and expressed
                        appreciation that he had come to see us and learn about the way our people
                        live. The President also said that we admired Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s vigor and energy he devotes to
                        the cause in which he believes and to his country. While we may not always
                        agree with his views, we appreciate his influence on the matters affecting
                        the relations between our two countries. The President expressed the hope
                        that during these two days a better understanding of world events could be
                        reached. The President also recalled that his predecessor had welcomed Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to the United States
                        and he said that it was a privilege for him to welcome Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> here on this small piece of the
                        U.S. Finally, he expressed the hope that the conversations would be fruitful
                        and said that it was a matter of personal satisfaction for him to be able to
                        welcome Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> at this
                        time.</p>
                    <p>(6) In response to the toast, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> expressed the hope that wisdom would be found to
                        ensure good relations between the two countries and throughout the world. He
                        said he did not want to exaggerate the role assigned to the two countries by
                        history, but in their pursuit of <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0208"/>peace the two countries could stop, by joint effort, any war that might be
                        started by some other country. The respective views of the two countries
                        were well known and the purpose here was not to persuade each other.
                        However, the Soviet people were also human beings and they wanted their
                        generations to live and prosper. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he had had the pleasure of visiting the
                        United States at former President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>'s invitation. He said he respected <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and expressed regret at the
                        unhappy development of their relations. The <gloss target="#t_U21">U-2</gloss> flight had been the main cause of such a development and he
                        was almost sure that <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had
                        not known about the flight. Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> decided to take the responsibility for this
                        flight in the spirit of chivalry. The flight was an effort on the part of
                        the people who wanted to worsen the relations between the two countries and
                        they achieved their goal. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> expressed his regret that he could not receive
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and said he hoped to receive the
                        President when time was ripe. The road for such a visit was open. The
                        President would be a welcome guest if he should wish to come. However, one
                        note of caution was in order. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had thought that just by showing the Soviet people a
                        dream kitchen, a kitchen that certainly did not exist nor would ever exist
                        in the US, he would convert the Soviet people to capitalism. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> apologized for referring to
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, a citizen of the United
                        States, but said that only <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        could have thought of such nonsense. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> continued by saying the President would be free
                        to see everyone in the Soviet Union and to get the feel of their life. The
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is not afraid for its system. It
                        believes in it and it rests on a sound basis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he had always been an
                        optimist and had always believed in the wisdom of man. However, the
                        commercial language of bargaining is sometimes used in dealings with the
                        Soviet Union. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is told “you give in
                        and we will give in”, but “what can I concede?” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> asked. Concession of even a
                        portion, a lump of peace would mean no peace at all. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is blamed for Communist movements in
                        various countries. But, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said, he did not know even who their leaders
                        were. He is too busy at home. Marx and Engels are the originators of
                        Communism and if anyone is to blame for Communism, it should be the Germans.
                        True, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has adopted Marxism and in
                        that sense perhaps it should share the blame. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said this was just a joke and
                        that, in a more serious vein, he wanted to say that the Soviet people
                        respect the American people. They admire their successes. As a matter of
                        fact, after the Revolution the level of US technology and science was set as
                        a goal for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. American technicians
                        were invited to the Soviet Union, and such people as Colonel Cooper, who had
                        helped build Dneprestroi, and Mr. Morgan, an engineer who participated in
                        the construction of the Moscow subway, were awarded Soviet decorations. Mr.
                        Morgan visited the Soviet Union later and said that he was building housing
                        in Turkey. However, it was known to the Soviet Union that in <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0209"/>fact he was building bases there, but this
                        is a matter for his own conscience. Ideologically, our two countries are at
                        opposite poles but this should not prevent them from ensuring a better
                        future for their peoples. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then raised his glass to the President's health
                        and said that he envied the President because he was so young. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that if he were the
                        President's age, he would devote even more energy to his cause.
                        Nevertheless, even at 67, he was not renouncing the competition. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> concluded by saying
                        that he and the President had met well and that he was sure that they would
                        part even better.</p>

                    <p>After lunch the President invited Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> for a short walk in the garden.<note n="2" xml:id="d85fn2">A memorandum of the luncheon conversation is printed as

                        the President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        how he managed to make himself available for such prolonged conversations
                        as, for example he had had, with Senator Humphrey and Walter Lippmann.<note n="3" xml:id="d85fn3">For a record of the interview with Senator
                            Humphrey in December 1958, see <ref target="frus1958-60v08">

                            VIII</ref>, pp. 148-152. Regarding the interview with Walter Lippmann,
                            see <ref target="#d69fn3">footnote 3, Document 69</ref>.</note> The
                        President said he understood that no one had interrupted the Chairman during
                        those meetings. As far as he was concerned, the President continued, his
                        schedule was very crowded and he was constantly wanted on the telephone, so
                        that it was very difficult for him to have time for lengthy uninterrupted
                        meetings.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that it was
                        true that he had indeed had prolonged uninterrupted meetings with Senator
                        Humphrey and Lippmann. The reason why he had time for such meetings was that
                        the Soviet Government had been decentralized to the extent that
                        administrative functions had been transferred to the governments of the
                        individual republics, while the government of the Union retained the
                        responsibility for over-all planning.</p>
                    <p>The President remarked that our system of several branches of government
                        involved contacts and consultations between the President and the various
                        branches, and that this was a time consuming process.</p>
                    <p>To this, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied:
                        “Well, why don't you switch to our system?”</p>
                    <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0211"/>
                    <p>The President then invited Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> for a private talk inside.</p>
                    <p>The President referred to the conversation before lunch<note n="4" xml:id="d85fn4">See <ref target="#d83">Document 83</ref>.</note> and
                        said that some of the problems faced by the two countries had been
                        discussed. Now he wanted to come back to the general thesis. While Laos was
                        one problem now under discussion, others might come up in the future. Thus,
                        it would be useful to discuss the general problem underlying the situation
                        and consider the specifics perhaps later. In addition to Laos, which had
                        already been discussed, such specifics might include Germany and nuclear
                        tests. The President then recalled Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s earlier reference to the death of feudalism. He
                        said he understood this to mean that capitalism was to be succeeded by
                        Communism. This was a disturbing situation because the French Revolution, as
                        the Chairman well knew, had caused great disturbances and upheavals
                        throughout Europe. Even earlier the struggle between Catholics and
                        Protestants had caused the Hundred Year War. Thus it is obvious that when
                        systems are in transition we should be careful, particularly today when
                        modern weapons are at hand. Whatever the result of the present
                        competition—and no one can be sure what it will be—both sides should act in
                        such a way as to prevent them from coming into direct contact and thus
                        prejudicing the establishment of lasting peace, which, the President said,
                        was his ambition.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> interjected that he
                        fully understood this.</p>
                    <p>Even the Russian Revolution had produced convulsions, even intervention by
                        other countries, the President continued. He then said that he wanted to
                        explain what he meant by “miscalculation”. In Washington, he has to attempt
                        to make judgments of events, judgments which may be accurate or not; he made
                        a misjudgment with regard to the Cuban situation. He has to attempt to make
                        judgments as to what the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will do next,
                        just as he is sure that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has to make judgments as to the moves of the US.
                        The President emphasized that the purpose of this meeting was to introduce
                        greater precision in these judgments so that our two countries could survive
                        this period of competition without endangering their national security.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> responded by saying
                        that this was a good idea and that this was what he called demonstration of
                        patience and understanding. However, judging by some of the President's
                        statements, the Soviet Union understood the situation differently. The US
                        believes that when people want to improve their lot, this is a machination
                        by others. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that
                        he liked the President's statement in his message to Congress to the effect
                        that it was difficult to defend ideas not supporting better standards of
                        living. However, the President drew the wrong conclusion. <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0212"/>He believes that when people rise against
                        tyrants, that is a result of Moscow's activities. This is not so. Failure by
                        the US to understand this generates danger. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> does not foment revolution but the United States always
                        looks for outside forces whenever certain upheavals occur. One example of
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s determination not to interfere
                        in internal affairs of other countries is Iran, an ally of the United
                        States. The Soviet Union does not want a revolution there and does not do
                        anything in that country to promote such a development. However, the people
                        of the country are so poor that the country has become a volcano and changes
                        are bound to occur sooner or later. The Shah will certainly be overthrown.
                        By supporting the Shah, the United States generates adverse feelings toward
                        the United States among the people of Iran and, conversely, favorable
                        feelings toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. This, of course,
                        is to the US's own disadvantage. The Soviet Union does not sympathize with
                        dictators or tyranny. This is the crux of the matter. No agreement seems to
                        be possible on this point, but this fact should be taken into account. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> reiterated that the
                        President's views were correct but that he drew the wrong conclusion.
                        Another example of this situation is Cuba. A mere handful of people, headed
                        by <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Fidel Castro</persName>, overthrew the Batista
                        regime because of its oppressive nature. During <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>'s fight against Batista, US capitalist circles, as
                        they are called in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, supported
                        Batista and this is why the anger of the Cuban people turned against the
                        United States. The President's decision to launch a landing in Cuba only
                        strengthened the revolutionary forces and <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>'s own position, because the people of Cuba were
                        afraid that they would get another Bastista and lose the achievements of the
                        revolution. <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> is not a Communist
                        but US policy can make him one. US policy is grist on the mill of
                        Communists, because US actions prove that Communists are right. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he himself
                        had not been born a Communist and that it was capitalists who had made him a
                        Communist. He continued by saying that the President's concept was a
                        dangerous one. The President had said that the US had attacked Cuba because
                        it was a threat to American security. Can six million people really be a
                        threat to the mighty US? The United States has stated that it is free to
                        act, but what about Turkey and Iran? These two countries are US followers,
                        they march in its wake, and they have US bases and rockets. If the US
                        believes that it is free to act, then what should the US do? The US has set
                        a precedent for intervention in internal affairs of other countries. The
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is stronger than Turkey and Iran,
                        just as the US is stronger than Cuba. This situation may cause
                        miscalculation, to use the President's term. Both sides should agree to rule
                        out miscalculation. This is why, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said, he was happy that the President had said
                        that Cuba was a mistake.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and expressed the belief that unless the present
                        Prime Minister of Iran improved <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0213"/>the
                        lot of his people and ensured better living conditions, there would be
                        important changes in that country. The second point he wanted to make, the
                        President said, was that he held no brief for Batista. The disagreement
                        between the United States and <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>
                        is not over monopolies; this question could be subject to discussion. The
                        main point is that Castro has announced his intention to act in that general
                        area, using Cuba as a base. This could eventually create a peril to the
                        United States. A further point is, the President said, that the United
                        States recognizes that it has bases in Turkey and Iran. However, these two
                        countries are so weak that they could be no threat to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, no more than Cuba to the US. The
                        President reminded Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> of
                        the announced policy of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> that it
                        would not tolerate governments hostile to it in areas which it regards as
                        being of national interest to it. He inquired what the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s reaction would be if a government
                        associated with the West were established in Poland. The United States
                        stands for the right of free choice for all peoples and if <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> had acted in that spirit, he might
                        have obtained endorsement. The United States has never taken any action with
                        regard to such countries as Guinea or Mali, because the governments in those
                        countries were freely elected and their policies are regarded by the United
                        States as the judgment of their leadership. The President concluded by
                        saying that it was critical to have the changes occurring in the world and
                        affecting the balance of power take place in a way that would not involve
                        the prestige or the treaty commitments of our two countries. The changes
                        should be peaceful. Finally, the President said, if certain governments
                        should fail to produce better living for their people, if they failed to
                        give better education, higher standard of living, etc., to their people, and
                        if they worked in the interest of only a small group, their days would be
                        doomed. But in all these developments, the President reiterated, we should
                        avoid direct contact between our two countries so as not to prejudice the
                        interests of their national security.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he agreed with the
                        President's conclusion. Likewise, there were some points of agreement
                        between him and the President with regard to Cuba, although there was still
                        considerable disagreement. For instance, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said, he agreed that the right of free choice
                        should be ensured to all peoples but the question of choice should be solely
                        up to the people themselves. If <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>
                        has not held any elections, this is an internal affair and it grants no one
                        the right to intervene. If Castro fails to give freedom to his people he
                        will detach himself from them and he will be removed just as Batista was. It
                        would be a different situation if our two countries took it upon themselves
                        to decide this question. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then said that he had noted some inconsistency in
                        US policy. He specified that he did not mean the policy of the President
                        personally, because he had been in the White House only since quite
                        recently, but rather US policy in general. He said that the United <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0214"/>States places great emphasis on
                        democracy. However, if one takes Iran as an example, the ruler there is the
                        Shah, who says that his power was given to him by God. Everybody knows how
                        this power was seized by the Shah's father, who had been a Sergeant in the
                        Iranian Army and who had usurped the throne by means of murder, plunder, and
                        violence. Now the United States supports the Shah and the Iranian people
                        transfer, as it were, their anger from the Shah to the United States. The
                        United States is spending vast sums of money in Iran but that money does not
                        go to the people; it is plundered by the Shah's entourage. The situation
                        with regard to Franco<note n="5" xml:id="d85fn5">General Francisco Franco y
                            Bahamonde, Spanish Chief of State.</note> is a similar one. The US knows
                        how he came to power and yet it supports him. The United States supports the
                        most reactionary regimes and this is how the people see US policy. This
                        weakens US policy. The United States knows that Soviet policy is more
                        popular than US policy in many areas where there is no Communism today. The
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> supports the aspirations of the
                        people but it believes that the main thing is to be tolerant and not to
                        interfere. People should be left to decide for themselves which form of
                        government they desire. As to <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Fidel
                            Castro</persName>, he was no Communist but then the US put pressure on
                        him and applied sanctions against him, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> came to his assistance, in the form of trade and technical
                        support. Under the influence of this aid he may turn Communist but, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said, he as a
                        Communist could not see which way Castro would go. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then expressed the hope that the
                        relations between the US and Cuba would improve in such fields as trade,
                        etc. Such a statement, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        observed, might sound strange to the United States, but the USSR believes
                        that such a development would improve relations not only in the Western
                        Hemisphere, but also throughout the world. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then referred to Turkey and said that in the
                        recent change that had occurred in that country, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had remained neutral because it regarded
                        the change as an internal affair of that country. Likewise, there had been a
                        second change in Korea within a relatively short time. Neither the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> nor North Korea had interfered. One can
                        say, however, that the present government will not last very long because it
                        cannot give anything to the people. Of course, if South Korea did something
                        in North Korea, the latter will act and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will support it. However, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s position is that of non-interference and of not creating
                        new points of friction. It is a policy directed at bringing about a stable
                        situation throughout the world. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then addressed himself to the Laotian situation
                        and said that the President knew very well that it had been the US
                        Government which had overthrown <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                            Phouma</persName>. One should be frank and recognize that both the
                        United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are supplying
                        arms in Laos. The side supported by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will be more successful because the arms supplied <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0215"/>by the United States are directed
                        against the people and the people do not want to take them. In China, the
                        arms supplied by the United States to <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang
                            Kai-shek</persName> went to Mao Tse-tung. <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> becamesort of a transfer point for American
                        arms to MaoTse-tung. The reason for that was that Chiang's troops simply
                        would not fight against the people. At that point Mao Tse-tung was weaker
                        militarily than <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>, but
                        he won because his ideas won. In general, the history of revolutions is very
                        instructive. During the Russian Revolutiqn, the revolutionaries were weak
                        and a counter-revolution occurred. The revolutionaries had to fight against
                        the counter-revolutionaries, the British, the Japanese, the French, and
                        others. Even the United States intervened. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> recalled in this connection that he had read a
                        book by an American Colonel entitled “U.S. Adventure in Siberia”.<note n="6" xml:id="d85fn6">William S. Graves, <hi rend="italic">America's Siberian
                                Adventure, 1918-1920</hi>, New York, 1931.</note> Notwithstanding
                        all this, the revolution was victorious because the people were on its side.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then said that we must
                        be patient. If the United States supports old, moribund, reactjonary
                        regimes, then a precedent of internal intervention will be set, which might
                        cause a clash between our two countries. The USSR certainly does not desire
                        such a development.</p>
                    <p>The President rejoined by saying that he wished to explain the logic of what
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> considered to be the
                        illogical point in US position. He said that he wanted to do this not in
                        order to defend any of our actions, but simply to explain things as we saw
                        them. The President stated that we regard the present balance of power
                        between Sino-Soviet forces and the forces of the United States and Western
                        Europe as being more or less in balance. The President said that he did not
                        wish to discuss the details of the respective military postures, but that
                        generally this was how we saw the situation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> interjected that he
                        agreed with this.</p>
                    <p>The President then said that the United States has three interests. The first
                        interest is that the right of free choice be ensured to all peoples and that
                        such right be executed through elections as we understand them. He said that
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may not agree with
                        this but this is what we desire. Such free choice is not possible today in
                        many areas of the world. It is not possible in Cuba, it is not possible in
                        Spain. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had said that
                        he could not understand how the US could object to Cuba while it was
                        supporting Spain. The reason is that our second interest is of a strategic
                        nature. Spain has no allies. It is a power standing alone. It is a
                        dictatorship, but it makes no contribution to our strength.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> interjected that the US
                        had bases in Spain. The President replied that those bases were moving into
                        history. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> observed that
                        they were still there.</p>
                    <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0216"/>
                    <p>The President continued by saying that we also support Yugoslavia, which is
                        not a capitalist country. Thus, the question might arise how the logic of
                        our policy could be justified. The reason for this policy is that if Franco
                        should be replaced and if the new regime were to associate itself with the
                        Soviet Union, the balance of power in Western Europe would radically change
                        and this is, of course, a matter of great concern to us. The third interest
                        of the United States is to see that the next decade—and we cannot predict
                        which way the developments during that time will go—should proceed in a way
                        that would not greatly disturb the balance of power. The President said that
                        he was concerned how this balance of power might be affected as China
                        developed its military potential. This is our general view with which Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will not agree, but
                        this is the logic of our position. Referring to the Laotian question, the
                        President said that this was of particular concern to us. While relatively
                        unimportant from the strategic standpoint, this country was included under
                        the protocol to the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> agreement in the
                        Treaty Area, and thus we have treaty commitments in that area. The President
                        then said that speaking frankly, US policy in that region had not always
                        been wise. He stated that he had not been able to make a final judgment as
                        to what the people's desires in that area are. According to our information,
                        there are about nine or ten thousand Pathet Lao but they have two distinct
                        advantages in our view. One is that they are for change. The President
                        remarked that he himself is for change and that he had been elected on the
                        basis of his advocacy of change. He then said that was not to say that if a
                        change were to occur in Laos it would be the one the people wanted. The
                        second advantage Pathet Lao has is the fact that they received support not
                        only in the form of supplies, but also in the form of Viet Minh manpower,
                        which has made them a stronger force. The problem now from a historical
                        standpoint is to find a solution not involving the prestige or the interests
                        of our two countries. The President recalled that last March<note n="7" xml:id="d85fn7">Reference is to the meeting between the President and
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, March 27; see <ref target="#d50">Document 50</ref>.</note> he had said that the United
                        States wanted a neutral and independent Laos. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had said it wanted the same. The question now is of
                        definition of these two terms, “neutral” and “independent”. The President
                        said that he believed that Cambodia and Burma were neutral and independent
                        countries and inquired what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s view on this was.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he held the
                        same view.</p>
                    <p>The President continued by saying that the problem in Geneva was how to
                        secure a cease-fire in Laos and to establish a mechanism for its
                        verification. The point is that the Soviet side had stated that forces
                        associated with us had taken action against Pathet Lao. For our part, we
                        have information that forces supported by the Soviet Union have violated the
                            <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0217"/>cease-fire, particularly in the
                        Padong area. Therefore, the ICC should undertake to determine the exact
                        situation and if it were to find that the forces supported by the US are at
                        fault, the US would take the responsibility. If we support the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> in making such a determination, then the
                        next step would be to create a neutral and independent Laos.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he wished to
                        revert to the question of regimes which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> calls rotten and anti-popular. He said that he could cite
                        a number of countries where power had been seized by military means. Ayub
                        Khan, an ally of the United States, seized power by force in Pakistan by
                        displacing the then Prime Minister of that country, and the United States
                        immediately recognized him. A similar situation exists in other countries,
                        particularly in Latin America. Such regimes are anti-popular and yet the
                        United States supports them. However, if there is popular upheaval, the US
                        regards this as Communist seizure of power and does not support it. This is
                        dangerous for the future and leads to a deterioration of the situation.
                        There should be no interference and people should decide for themselves.
                        Tolerance and patience are absolutely required. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then said that he wanted to say
                        a few words about the so-called guerilla warfare against regimes that are
                        not to US liking. There has been a lot of talk about this kind of warfare in
                        the United States and this is a dangerous policy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> asked the President to believe
                        him that if guerilla units were to be sent from the outside and were not
                        supported by the people, that would be a hopeless undertaking. He said that
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had had great experience in this
                        kind of warfare throughout its own history. The war against Napoleon in
                        1812, the Civil War, including the struggle against the US in Siberia, and
                        World War II, had been fought with guerilla units. If guerilla troops are
                        local troops, belonging to the country, then every bush is their ally. If
                        they are not, then only bloodshed will occur and such an undertaking will
                        pay no dividends. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then
                        recalled his service in the Red Army and said that the Red Army had British
                        clothing seized from the White Army under Denikin, which was supported by
                        the British and whose units were destroyed by the Reds. In spite of its
                        being very poor, the Red Army won because the people were on its side. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then observed that our
                        two sides differed as to their understanding of what popular or anti-popular
                        movements were. However, both sides should agree not to interfere and let
                        the peoples decide for themselves. This is the only wise course to take.
                        Modern times are not like the past; modern weapons are terrible. He said
                        that he did not know whether the balance of power was exact, but that did
                        not matter anyway. Both sides know very well that they have enough power to
                        destroy each other. This is why there should be no interference. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then referred to
                        Angola and said that the United States supported Portugal in this matter
                        because it was its ally. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> regards
                        this situation as a popular war against <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0218"/>colonialists. The US has no colonies but it supports
                        colonial countries, and this is why the people are against it. There was a
                        time when the United States was a leader in the fight for freedom. As a
                        matter of fact, the Russian Czar refused to recognize the United States for
                        twenty-six years because he regarded the United States as an illegitimate
                        creature. Now the United States refuses to recognize New China—things have
                        changed, haven't they?</p>
                    <p>The President said that he wanted first to refer to Angola and said that he
                        agreed with what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had
                        said. In fact, the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had voted
                        alike in the U.N. General Assembly and Portugal was bitter because of this.
                        We have supported the liberation movement in Africa, and if one should take
                        a look at the map of Africa today, he would see a great number of new
                        countries. We hope that in the next two or three years the number will
                        increase still further.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> inquired with regard to
                        Algeria and the Congo.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the United States had supported U.N. actions directed
                        against Belgian interests in the Congo, particularly in the Katanga area,
                        where the Belgians relied on Tshombe.<note n="8" xml:id="d85fn8"> Moise
                            Tshombe, President of the Katanga Government.</note> The United States
                        supported U.N. actions which sharply curtailed Belgian influence in that
                        area. Belgium was of course disturbed by this.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that this was true
                        but the US voice in these matters was very timid. The Belgians may be
                        displeased but the people are even more displeased. US policy is very uneven
                        and even when the United States supports anti-colonialism for tactical
                        reasons, its voice is very quiet. Basically, US policy is that of support
                        for colonialist powers.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> the US is
                        allied to a number of countries which are colonial powers. Yet in view of
                        the great changes that have occurred in Africa, where some 25 countries have
                        obtained their independence in a very short time, it is quite clear what the
                        trend is.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that this was true
                        but wondered what the reason for this trend was and whose effort had brought
                        about the change. He said that if the two countries could unite their
                        efforts they could do away with the vestiges of colonialism. The liberated
                        peoples should be left alone to take any path they want. Naturally, the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be pleased if they took the
                        Socialist path.</p>
                    <p>The President then stated that what was of concern to the United States was
                        the speech Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had made
                        last January and in which he had advanced the thesis of three types of war.
                        The problem is how this thesis should be interpreted, particularly the point
                        on the so-called national wars of liberation. The fact is that certain
                        groups seize power, frequently by military means. Some of such groups are
                        friendly to <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0219"/>the USSR and some to
                        the United States, and the two countries lend support to them. If one takes
                        the situation in Viet Nam, there are some seven to fifteen thousand
                        guerillas there. We do not believe that they reflect the will of the people,
                        while the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may believe so. The problem
                        is to avoid getting involved in direct contact as we support the respective
                        groups. In Laos, where the two countries are openly supporting the
                        respective local groupings, the question is how to draw fire out of the
                        situation in a way that would be mutually satisfactory to both sides.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that the President
                        and himself had a different understanding of liberation wars. As far as Laos
                        is concerned, the Soviet Union is for an independent and neutral Laos and
                        the Foreign Ministers of the two countries are probably talking about this
                        problem right now. Referring to his January speech,<note n="9" xml:id="d85fn9">See <ref target="#d15">Document 15</ref>.</note> in
                        which he had mentioned three types of war, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that the U.N. had passed a resolution
                        advocating independence for all colonial peoples. Portugal has been flouting
                        that resolution and the question arises as to how long the people should
                        wait. In these circumstances, the people's only recourse is to rise in arms.
                        The Soviet Union believes that this is a sacred war. A similar situation
                        prevails in Algeria. De Gaulle, who is an ally of the United States, is an
                        intelligent man and perhaps he would be doing more if he had no problem with
                        his generals. Of course, this is an internal matter of France, but what
                        should the Algerian people do—wait for France? The fact is that Algeria
                        should belong to Algerians and Algerians are Arabs. The only thing they can
                        do is rise. Such a war is sacred and the Soviet Union supports it. Such wars
                        will go on. The United States itself rose against the British. The Soviet
                        Union has been proud of the United States in this respect. But now the US
                        has changed its position and it is against other peoples following its suit.
                        The Soviet Union is against all wars, both general and local. In this
                        respect it is ahead of the United States, because the United States
                        recognizes local wars. However, the Soviet Union recognizes the freedom of
                        struggle for liberty. Although the Soviet Union does not participate
                        directly, it sympathizes with and supports such wars. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then said that he wanted to say
                        a few words about China. At the same time, he wanted to emphasize that he
                        had not been authorized or requested to speak on China's behalf. He said he
                        simply wanted to set forth his thinking on the problem. He said that US
                        relations with China were very aggravated. Obviously they could not be
                        improved until the United States ended the occupation of Taiwan. The most
                        realistic policy would be that of recognizing China and having China
                        admitted as a member of the United Nations. What kind of United Nations is
                        it when it does not have among its members a nation numbering 600 million
                        people? On the other hand, it should be clear that China would never join
                        the <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0220"/>United Nations if <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> were to be still there.
                        This would be a discrimination against China's rights. There is no question
                        that at some point China will gather its strength and liberate Taiwan. If
                        the Soviet Union were in China's place, it would probably have attacked
                        Taiwan long time ago. The Soviet Union supports the policy of reunification
                        of China's territory. As a matter of fact, the United States itself signed a
                        document recognizing Taiwan as part of China. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he did not know
                        whether the United States was ready for a change in its policy toward China.
                        The relations between <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>
                        and Mao Tse-tung are an internal affair of China, and neither the US nor the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should interfere. This would be a
                        reasonable course and it would promote a peaceful development of the
                        situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that
                        he was glad that there were voices in the United States asking for a change
                        in US policy toward China, but said that he did not know how that policy
                        would develop. He reiterated that he had not been requested by the Chinese
                        to speak on their behalf.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he wanted to make two points. First, with regard to
                        the problem of national independence in Africa, he believed that Africa had
                        made an extraordinary step in that direction and the United States had
                        associated itself with that movement on many occasions. Perhaps more could
                        have been done, but we do have problems with our allies. The President
                        recalled that in 1956 he had spoken in the Senate about the need for
                        national self-determination in Algeria. This movement of self-determination
                        is now going on in Asia and Africa. What concerns us is what will come after
                        these changes. It is here that disagreement exists between our two
                        countries. The President recalled his remark about the balance of power
                        being more or less even today and stated that we were concerned that this
                        balance might be disturbed if some of these countries should associate
                        themselves with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. A glance at the
                        map of the divided world is a sufficient illustration of this point. The
                        second point regards China. The President said that even before he had
                        assumed office China had made strong attacks against the United States and
                        himself personally, and this has been going on like a drumbeat ever since.
                        At the same time the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was cordial and
                        expressed the hope that our relations would improve. The President said that
                        he recognized that China was a forceful nation, that its population was one
                        quarter of the world, and that it might still further increase its strength.
                        He also recognized that bad relations between the United States and China
                        affected world relations in general. However, if the United States were to
                        withdraw from Taiwan, it would have a strategic problem. It would be
                        confined to its shores and its strategic position in Asia would be greatly
                        impaired. This is a problem of security for the United States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that this was an
                        interesting conception with which he could not agree. Now he could
                        understand the President's conception <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0221"/>of neutrality. Apparently the US recognizes neutrality only
                        if countries are its followers. If not, no such recognition is given. The
                        Soviet position is just the opposite. The Soviet Union sympathizes with
                        countries which have embarked upon the Socialist path but it also gives full
                        recognition to capitalist countries and here is the difference. It is true
                        that if some country, e.g., in Africa, were to adopt the Socialist system,
                        that might mean that a few drops would be added to the bucket of Communist
                        power if this balance of power were regarded as consisting of a bucket on
                        each side. But this would be an expression of popular will. If there were to
                        be interference, there would be a chain reaction and ultimately war between
                        our two countries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        then recalled the recent visit to the Soviet Union by the Prime Minister of
                        Somalia. The Prime Minister is a comparatively young man who was educated in
                        the spirit of Italian culture. He said that he wanted his country to develop
                        along Socialist lines. But the question arises as to what is Socialism in
                        the view of all those people. Nasser, Nehru, Nkrumah, Sukarno <note n="10" xml:id="d85fn10"> Kwame Nkrumah, President of the Republic of Ghana, and
                            Akmed Sukarno, President of the Republic of Indonesia.</note>—all of
                        them have said that they want their countries to develop along Socialist
                        lines; but what kind of a Socialist is Nasser when he keeps Communists in
                        jail? Nehru certainly does not favor the Communist party of India either.
                        However, the Soviet Union helps these people and this is a manifestation of
                        its policy of non-interference. If a country embarks on the road of
                        capitalism the Soviet Union is convinced, and sincerely desires, that it
                        will return to the path of Socialism. But it will be the people who will
                        bring about such change. This is why the President's argument regarding
                        Taiwan sounds strange.</p>
                    <p>The President interjected that the situation should be viewed in the light of
                        Chinese hostility. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        replied that the Chinese cannot reconcile themselves with US bases on
                        Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> continued by saying
                        that this policy is unreasonable and might ultimately cause war. He then
                        stated that the United States had surrounded the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> with bases. This is very unwise and aggravates the
                        relations between the two countries. The countries where the bases are
                        located spend money on their military establishments while their people live
                        like paupers. Thus these people have the choice of developing along
                        militarist lines or rising. We must be reasonable and keep our forces within
                        our national boundaries. This is Soviet policy. The President himself has
                        recognized this fact because in his speeches he has stated the need for
                        reviewing the deployment of US bases, in part because of technological
                        developments and also for other reasons. So the people in the countries
                        where the United States has bases will rise and the US will blame the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for that, but it will be its own fault.
                        Thus, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0222"/>continued, the President's argument
                        only fortifies the views of the Chinese. The US will not leave Taiwan and
                        force will have to be used. This is a sad thing indeed. Referring to Chinese
                        statements, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that
                        the Chinese were against US policy, but then the Soviet Union has also
                        criticized US policy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        said that he had not spoken against the President personally and would not
                        wish to do so. He said he wanted to improve relations between the two
                        countries with the President in the White House, but he may turn out to be
                        wrong. In that event he would have to criticize the President too. The best
                        thing for the United States would be to recognize China because diplomatic
                        relations alone impose certain obligations. The United States could continue
                        to support <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>, but of
                        course only morally. The Chinese position is correct and the United States
                        should settle its differences with China. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> certainly hopes that this will take place. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> reiterated that if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had been in China's shoes, it would have
                        acted long time ago. He again referred to the fight against Americans in the
                        Far East and against the French, the British, and Germans in other areas of
                        Russia during the Civil War. He said that this fight had been carried on
                        until its victorious end and that any country would do the same. Such wars
                        are not aggressive, they are holy wars.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he wanted to reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s remark regarding the US's conception of
                        neutrality. He said he believed that our two countries with their different
                        social systems or any other country could pursue an independent policy.
                        Yugoslavia, India, and Burma are extremely satisfactory situations as far as
                        the United States is concerned. The problem is if the Communist cause were
                        to win in certain areas and if those areas were to associate themselves
                        closely with the Soviet Union, that would create strategic problems for the
                        United States. The same would apply to the Soviet Union if in a country like
                        Poland a government were created that associated itself closely with the
                        West. Referring to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        remark that the United States supports certain governments which are not
                        supported by the people, the President said that this may be so. However,
                        the President said, if the people of Poland were given a chance to express
                        their choice, one could not be certain as to what the result would be.
                        Certainly one could think that they might not necessarily support the
                        present government. The President then said that certain problems cannot be
                        successfully settled, at least here. However, he expressed the hope that the
                        Laotian problem could be discussed in more detail as well as the problem of
                        nuclear tests, which is of interest to our two countries and to the world in
                        general. Agreement on this issue would certainly improve the climate
                        throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he wanted to
                        reply on the question of Poland. He said it was not respectful on the
                        President's part to speak in such a manner of a government the US recognizes
                        and with which it maintains <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0223"/>diplomatic relations. After all, Poland could say similar things about the
                        United States. This, he said, is the line of aggravating rather than
                        improving relations. He suggested that the situation be tested, perhaps by
                        having a public debate any place in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or the United States, and then the people will say where
                        the truth lies. Poland has had elections to its parliament, the Sejm, and
                        its election system is more democratic than that in the United States.</p>
                    <p>The President interjected that people in the United States had a choice,
                        whereas in Poland there was only one group. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that parties in the United States were
                        only for the purpose of deluding the people, since there was no difference
                        between the parties. This, he said, was the opinion of the Soviet Union,
                        which, of course, did not commit either the Soviet Union or the United
                        States to anything. In any event, no one should interfere in the Soviet
                        Union's internal affairs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> continued by saying that another test of the
                        situation would be to withdraw the forces of the two sides and have the
                        people decide. The Soviet Union has very few forces in Poland and has
                        already withdrawn its troops from Hungary. If forces were withdrawn, there
                        would not be even a semblance of pressure on the people in those areas.
                        Referring to Taiwan, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        recalled the President's remark that withdrawal of US troops from that area
                        would affect US strategic posture. This, he said, might be true, but what
                        about the Chinese position—how should they regard the occupation of Taiwan?
                        If the United States proceeds from such an assumption, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said, he will be forced to doubt
                        whether the United States really wants peaceful co- existence or is simply
                        seeking a pretext for warlike developments. The Soviet Union sympathizes
                        with the Chinese and this seems to be the only solution. There is no other
                        way out. After all, the United States might even occupy Crimea and say that
                        this would improve its strategic position. This would be true. But it would
                        be the policy of Dulles, a policy of strength. Times have changed and such
                        policy is doomed to failure. If the US wants to dictate its conditions, that
                        is inconceivable today. No improvement of relations would be possible in
                        such circumstances. Reverting to Laos, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that the Conference was in session and that
                        it was there that a solution should be worked out. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will exert efforts to solve the Laotian
                        question and have a government establish control in that country. However,
                        the Soviet Union will not agree to the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>'s
                        becoming a kind of supragovernment administering the country.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he wanted to respond to these remarks without
                        referring to Poland or Taiwan. He said he agreed that the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> should be no government. However, it should
                        determine whether a cease-fire exists. The Soviet side has claimed that
                        there have been breaches on the part of the forces supported by us. Our
                        people have said that the forces supported by the Soviet Union have breached
                        the cease-fire. The President <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0224"/>said
                        he believed it would be a simple matter for the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to examine these charges and to submit its report. This
                        should take only a few days and then the next step would be the creation of
                        an independent and neutral Laos.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> responded by saying
                        that the Soviet Union approached the situation differently. Referring to the
                        President's remark that Viet Minh forces were involved in Laos, he said that
                        he had no such information and that this was inaccurate. What is more
                        accurate, and what is an actual fact, is that military action was started
                        from Thailand by the United States.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that whether he or Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> were right the problem was to have the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> examine the situation with regard to the
                        cease-fire, without action by Viet Minh or any other action. The cease-fire
                        is the main problem now.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he agreed.
                        However, he said that this could not be done without taking into account the
                        forces participating in the struggle. There are three forces in this area
                        and they must agree among themselves. Even if our two countries were to
                        agree, that agreement would serve no useful purpose without agreement among
                        the forces participating in the struggle.</p>
                    <p>The President suggested that the two countries use their influence with the
                        people they are associated with to induce them to support the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and grant the Commission free access to the
                        respective areas, so that the Commission could perform its task effectively.
                        Then the next step would be the creation of an independent and neutral
                        Laos.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> expressed agreement
                        that both countries should use their influence so as to bring about
                        agreement among the forces participating in the Laotian struggle.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he believed that on this point agreement could be
                        reached here. He remarked facetiously that this should be possible even if
                        no agreement could be reached on the merits of the American election
                        system.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that this latter
                        question was an internal affair of the United States.</p>
                    <p>In view of the late hour, the President suggested that perhaps, if there was
                        a chance, the question of nuclear tests could be discussed during the dinner
                        given by the Austrian President, so that tomorrow most of the time could be
                        devoted to the problem of Germany. Otherwise, both problems could be
                        discussed tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that he would
                        like to connect the questions of nuclear tests and disarmament. He said that
                        he would set forth his position on this issue as well as, of course, on
                        Germany. The main problem in this latter matter is that of a peace treaty.
                        The Soviet Union hopes that the US will understand this question so that
                        both countries can sign a <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0225"/>peace
                        treaty together. This would improve relations. But if the United States
                        refuses to sign a peace treaty, the Soviet Union will do so and nothing will
                        stop it.</p>

                    <p>In conversations at the Ambassador's Residence in Vienna following the
                        President's luncheon for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        the Secretary and Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> turned to a discussion on disarmament. The Secretary
                        referred to the so-called bilateral disarmament talks at Washington
                        beginning June 19 to be continued a few weeks later in Moscow. He thought
                        that perhaps an agreement could be reached on proposals regarding
                        particularly the forum for broader disarmament discussions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he had made to
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> a number of
                        reasonable proposals as to composition and the Secretary pointed out that
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> had made some
                        reasonable proposals on our side as well.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> referred to the fact that the
                        US was always talking about control [verification]. He said that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had spoken at length
                        of Soviet willingness to accept control of disarmament in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly session last fall. Not a
                        single other delegation had made any <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0226"/>mention of this proposal. The Secretary said that this question could be
                        discussed endlessly on a purely theoretical basis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> knew as well as he that nobody
                        would disarm during the next few years. He said that perhaps if everybody
                        were really disarmed then the question of controls would be a simple matter.
                        In this connection he wanted to say frankly that the US was very taken aback
                        by the Soviet position in the resumed nuclear test negotiations in Geneva.
                        Without replying directly to the Secretary, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> entered into a history of disarmament discussions
                        and negotiations over the past 15 or 16 years. He said that there had been
                        endless discussions of partial measures of disarmament and they had led to
                        absolutely no results. All Soviet proposals for measures in this field had
                        been rejected on the grounds that they would change the balance of power in
                        favor of the Soviet Union. It was now time to tackle general and complete
                        disarmament instead of starting up a new round of discussions of partial
                        measures which could go on for another 10 years.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then said that in view of the many years that had passed he
                        wanted to ask Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> frankly why
                        the Soviet Union had rejected the Baruch proposals.<note n="2" xml:id="d86fn2">For text of this proposal, June 14, 1946, see <hi rend="italic">A Decade of American Foreign Policy: Basic Documents,
                                1941-1949</hi>, pp. 865-871.</note> After some personal references
                        to Mr. Baruch, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that
                        those proposals were calculated to ensure a continued US monopoly of atomic
                        weapons. The Secretary said he thought this had been one of a number of
                        other mistakes and that the Soviets could have easily accomplished the
                        almost complete disarmament of the United States, instead of prodding us
                        into rearming. Gromyko asked what they should have done and the Secretary
                        replied that they should have left Greece alone, left Berlin alone, and left
                        Korea alone. He then went on to say that when the rest of the world did not
                        know what was going on in the Soviet Union this was a deterrent to
                        disarmament. In fact, he said, the Soviet Union could not maintain its
                        policies of military secrecy and also achieve disarmament. These two
                        policies—and he was willing to grant that the Soviet Union really wanted
                        disarmament—were incompatible. There was some discussion of post-war
                        developments in this field including a reference to Roosevelt's statement at
                        Yalta that American troops would be maintained in Europe only a couple of
                        years after the war. At the end of this discussion the Secretary said he saw
                        only two roads to disarmament. The first would be by the prior settlement of
                        political problems which might create possibilities for a broader
                        disarmament agreement. The second would be disarmament on a step by step
                        basis with full verification and control at each step. Gromyko interjected
                        that one of the United States' principal allies, Chancellor Adenauer, had
                        repeatedly said and even said in a letter to Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that no solution of political
                        problems was possible unless there was first progress <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0227"/>on disarmament. The Secretary resumed
                        saying that he had followed disarmament questions carefully since 1925. For
                        nearly 30 years one disarmament conference after another had taken place.
                        They seemed to him ceremonial like the mating dance of the goonie birds in
                        the Pacific Islands. He felt it was time to be realistic about this problem.
                        The immediate action was the conference in Geneva. He repeated that we were
                        skeptical about the regression in the Soviet position there. In the broad
                        field of disarmament this was a simple matter but it was a vital test. If
                        the Soviets were serious about disarmament they would really try to come to
                        an acceptable agreement in Geneva.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then referred to the US
                        adoption of the Russian word “troika” to describe the new Soviet
                            proposals.<note n="3" xml:id="d86fn3">For text of the Soviet troika
                            proposal, April 28, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament,
                                1961</hi>, pp. 134-142. Extracts are printed in <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1961</hi>, pp.
                            1129-1130.</note> The Secretary interjected that the troika had appeared
                        in twelve different places now. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> resumed, saying troika was a good word and a good
                        idea. The Soviets felt that this proposal was no more than adequate to
                        protect the Soviet Union's natural rights. They were only asking for
                        one-third, not two-thirds. They had a right to one-third. Any decisions
                        adopted under the troika proposals against Soviet interests—or indeed
                        against US interests—would be excluded. He said flatly that they were not
                        going to deviate from this proposal. He did not want to use the word
                        “demand” which was too strong but the Soviets were very firm on this. There
                        was a question of the test ban negotiations, and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or any other international organization. If the troika
                        proposals were adopted the US would be even better off than the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> because the other one-third would side
                        more often with the US than with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
                        The Secretary commented that the real question was whether or not one-third
                        should have a veto. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied
                        that if there were no veto the Soviet proposal would not make sense. The
                        Secretary said that if adequate investigations of seismic events were not
                        agreed on, a nuclear test ban would become improbable. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied—after some uncertainty as
                        to whether he had said two or three—that three investigations would be
                        acceptable, subject of course to the agreed seismic indicators; against this
                        the US was proposing 20 investigations (Mr. Nitze interjected 20 or 30
                        indicating he was matching Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s reference to “2 or 3”).</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the Soviet troika proposals were a real block to any
                        progress in the disarmament field. If they were maintained, it would be a
                        waste of time even to discuss disarmament since no disarmament would be
                        possible if any one country could block any real inspection. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then cited as a precedent,
                        President Roosevelt's proposal of a veto in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council. The Secretary confirmed that the US <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0228"/>continued to accept a veto of the
                        kind contained in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter. However, he
                        pointed out that this was really limited in its original concept to
                        considerations involving the use of force and the possibility of war.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that if the whole
                        world were capitalist perhaps the question of the veto would not arise.
                        However, the Socialist bloc does exist. The Secretary said that even if
                        there were a disarmament agreement the first Soviet veto would bring it to
                        an end since this would be an automatic signal to all the other parties to
                        start to rearm.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then said that in the present
                        circumstances general and complete disarmament was the only way out. The
                        Secretary asked him if he were sure that general and complete disarmament
                        was a real policy of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> which they
                        were ready to put into practical effect. He asked further what the Soviets
                        would do, for example, with the Poles, the Czechs, or Hungarians if they had
                        no arms. (At this point there were some side talks between <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> during which the latter said the Secretary's
                        statement implied Soviet domination of Eastern European countries.)
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that what
                        happened in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and so forth, was a question that they
                        would decide for themselves. Of course there were treaty commitments between
                        some of these countries just as there were between the US and their allies.
                        The Secretary said that he had just been wondering about this question.
                        Certainly, he observed, an early result of disarmament would be the
                        self-determination of peoples. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that the Soviets were always ready for
                        self-determination. However, he believed he saw in the Secretary's remarks
                        the roots of a wrong approach. The Secretary's idea would not help. He then
                        said (rather as an after-thought) that it was possible that the Americans
                        had some doubt about the behavior of its present allies after general and
                        complete disarmament.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then asked when the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had
                        adopted the troika idea. Was it only two years ago? <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that everybody gets wiser
                        in time or should get wiser. He said that the Soviets' experience with the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> operation in the Congo had made them
                        realize the importance of this proposal. He then went on at some length as
                        to the long years of US domination of the United Nations by a mechanical
                        voting majority. Referring to the fact that the composition of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had changed, the Secretary said he would have
                        understood the troika proposal better if it had been made in the late
                        1940's. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that the
                        Soviets had not made it at that time because they thought the United States
                        would behave better in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and operate on
                        a basis of reconciling the views of the wartime allies on all major
                        problems. President Roosevelt's veto proposals for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter represented a very realistic
                        approach. However, the United States since that time has invalidated many
                        provisions of the Charter and emasculated the Security Council.</p>
                    <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0229"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> arrangements had been worked out by
                        compromise so that there would be no direct collision of interests. It was
                        the deviations from UN principles that had caused trouble. The Secretary
                        suggested that it might be helpful to hear the views of each side concerning
                        the course of events since the adoption of the Charter.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the Charter was good,
                        though some provisions were vague. The Soviets did not wish to place
                        themselves in a position where on all matters substantively affecting their
                        interests they were outvoted. Nor would they want to put the US in that
                        position. The US would also be better off under a troika arrangement.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said this arrangement would run against every principle of
                        arbitration and conciliation. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        said they did not want arbitration. Nothing said about the Security Council
                        or in the General Assembly halls would convince them that any arrangement
                        would produce impartial voting. Always, even in the International Court of
                        Justice, voting reflected the state of affairs in the world. Arbitration and
                        conciliation, therefore, were not solutions to the problem and would not
                        help.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary expressed regrets that the preceding Administration had not
                        gotten a test ban agreement before the Soviets invented the troika.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the US should have
                        accepted before the Soviets became wiser.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he was pessimistic regarding the troika and doubted
                        whether the other two-thirds, as the Soviets term them, would see a solution
                        in it. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the
                        two-thirds was the formal side of the question. The substantive side was
                        that any international body would not take decisions that related to the
                        security interests of all countries without unanimity. There were two sides
                        to the troika proposal: the three-sided arrangement plus unanimity of the
                        most powerful countries. The US wants an order by which it could impose its
                        decisions on the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked how he could convince the US that this was not
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> reminded <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that disarmament was a question
                        which affected the vital interests of our countries, and we are thus dealing
                        with the question of whether and how an agreement can be made effective and
                        how its implementation can be insured at each stage.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that one could adopt a
                        paper agreement but not contribute to a solution. You must seek agreement
                        with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; this is the way of solution.
                        We do not want to take decisions against you. You must reconcile your
                        interests with ours. Under President Roosevelt one proceeded from this
                        assumption. If the two powers were not able to reconcile their interests, it
                        was better not to have a decision.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> suggested that
                        there was a vast difference between important political decisions where it
                        might possibly be granted that no great power could let others tell them
                        what to do. Applying <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0230"/>this to
                        disarmament was somewhat like the following analogy: Two men have revolvers
                        and decide to give them up. They must be able to check whether another
                        revolver is not hidden under the vest of the second party.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the Soviets are aiming
                        at this purpose. General and complete disarmament—if a treaty was concluded,
                        then all pockets could be examined. Even trousers could be taken off.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> asked how you get through
                        the intermediate stages. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said
                        they did not propose <gloss target="#t_GCD1">GCD</gloss> like a rocket shot.
                        They had done their best to set out the stages with controls. Until complete
                        disarmament was reached, there naturally would not be complete control. The
                        degree of control would be in accordance with the degree of disarmament.
                        Control would be in accordance with the steps being taken.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said the test ban could be
                        viewed as a first step in which we could see how controls would work out.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MHF1">Matthews</persName> said he concluded
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was pessimistic regarding
                        disarmament. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied he was
                        pessimistic regarding the US position on disarmament. There was a question
                        of the horse and the cart, and the Soviets proposed that the two go
                        together.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he wished to understand how the troika administration
                        would actually work. Suppose we have an agreement regarding the number of
                        inspection posts and the number of on-site inspections. The machines record
                        a seismic event, say in Reno, of a magnitude above the 4.75 threshold. If
                        the inspection teams say that they should go to Reno and this inspection
                        would be within the agreed number, is it the Soviet view that the US
                        Administrator on the troika could say “No, you cannot go to Reno?” <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that if the inspection was in
                        the quota of say three per year, it would be carried out according to the
                        provisions on which understanding had been reached. It would be up to the
                        scientists to agree. There would be a question regarding other
                        inspections.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said for the moment we were talking about the number of agreed
                        inspections. If the scientists have to agree unanimously, then we get the
                        same problem all over at a different level. However, if there was an
                        acknowledged seismic event above the 4.75 threshold, on what question do the
                        Soviets consider it necessary for the country being inspected to have
                        reservations? We would already have agreed to the necessity for the
                        inspections. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that the
                        functions of the administrative body were not precisely determined. As far
                        as the agreement on the quota of inspections, if the scientific instruments
                        agreed on the need for inspection, then it must be examined.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said suppose the US
                        scientists think the event not up to the 4.75 threshold, the Soviets and
                        other (perhaps British) scientists say the event was above the threshold.
                        Can the US Administrator veto inspection teams going to Reno? <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the administrators should <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0231"/>agree; it can't be done
                        automatically. The Secretary wondered whether this was not a formal
                        requirement. We both assume that we would not be testing if the agreement
                        were signed. Can't we be reasonably relaxed regarding inspection? We would
                        not expect anything to be found in Reno, and the Soviets would probably not
                        expect anything to be found in Kiev. Why prevent inspections? <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said if there were disagreement
                        among the scientists, then the administrative body should decide according
                        to the administrative rules, that is, the troika. Why build in advance such
                        an abundance of doubts? He asked the Secretary directly, do you think we are
                        exploding atomic weapons now? The Secretary replied that we have no evidence
                        that the Soviets are testing, but that it is very difficult to prove a
                        negative proposition. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stated
                        vigorously that the Soviets think that the US is sure the Soviets are not
                        testing.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said underground testing is more a problem than atmospheric
                        testing. We could probably work out an atmospheric agreement without much
                        difficulty. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the best
                        solution would be to prohibit all kinds of testing. The Secretary said we
                        would like to work toward it; 4.75 seems to be the practical limit right
                        now. If scientists can reduce this to zero, so much the better. You and we
                        understand that these things go to the heart of our national concerns. It is
                        somewhat easier for the Soviets since they can go all around the US on
                        busses and check up. He remarked in jest that the Soviets have fewer busses.
                        We did not in any case have to have US inspectors, and inspectors of other
                        nationalities, say Swiss, would be checking solely on the presence or
                        absence of an explosion.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said without an agreement it
                        is possible to detect all testing. An agreement would make everybody more
                        confident. Why should the US in advance suspect violations? The Soviets
                        considered such stress on voting and the veto an undue concern.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said one must assume these
                        matters affect the vital interests of our countries, and both countries had
                        an acknowledged interest in having inspections. Then we could invite Soviet
                        inspectors and they invite ours, and both would be serving their national
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said underground testing was not now detectable. The US wanted
                        to be sure the Soviets stop if we stop testing. He made the next aversion
                        just in case it presented a problem for the Soviets. Were there, he asked,
                        particular areas which the Soviets would not want to have examined? If so,
                        we could probably work out some way to handle this problem. He hoped this
                        was not an obstacle to Soviet agreement, but he gathered that this was a
                        far-reaching political issue for them.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the Soviets would resume
                        testing if the US did, and other countries would also. He emphasized that
                        the Soviets would not lose more than we by resumption. Everybody would lose,
                        but he replied the Soviets were not more interested in a testing agreement
                        than was the <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0232"/>US. The Secretary and
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> agreed that each other's
                        scientists would be asking for more money in case of resumption.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said that with
                        regard to the question of suspensions, it was a factor for the US that we
                        had to take the agreement to the Senate, and to successfully defend it, it
                        would have to be an agreement without loopholes. The Secretary said this was
                        the problem expressed in the second degree, the first degree was what we can
                        recommend ourselves to Congress. He did not want to review history, but
                        since 1945 we think there has been a long stretch of agreements that have
                        not been observed. Our problem of mutual trust is not a new one. Neither of
                        us can put its basic interests in the other's hands. We need assurances, and
                        we think that an effective inspection system could contribute to mutual
                        trust.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked where was that other
                        Hammarskjold that could be objective? The Secretary said that here we were
                        talking about a more limited question, regarding the troika applied to
                        inspection administration. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        said the situation was “most complicated.” The Secretary said <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> understood our political system and
                        would understand that a signature of a treaty would absorb the energies of
                        the Administration in getting passage of the agreement. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that especially regarding
                        foreign affairs matters the Administration could convince Senators.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we regretted the prospect that this issue might turn
                        up as a major problem in the field of general disarmament, even should we
                        all agree to go far down the road toward disarmament. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said we should proceed on
                        disarmament even without a testing agreement. Disarmament discussions should
                        not be conditional on this question of testing, although the situation would
                        be quite different if a testing agreement were signed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> asked how one could be
                        optimistic concerning the outlook for broader disarmament if we could not
                        solve the easier problems? <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        agreed that we should solve the testing agreement, but if we could not, it
                        was the Soviet position that general disarmament discussions should go
                        forward. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> asked whether the
                        troika proposal would not cut across other disarmament proposals. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that they had formulated
                        proposals for our examination. He again stressed that if tests were resumed,
                        the Soviets would not lose more than the US. Everybody would lose, but he
                        repeated that the Soviets would not lose more.</p>
                    <p>Later in the conversation, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        said the time might come when the US would regret it did not accept the
                        troika. The Secretary expressed his doubt, but said he had become reluctant
                        to become categorical as he had gotten older.</p>
                    <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0233"/>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he took it that we were on dead center regarding
                        nuclear testing. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> nodded and
                        said that “It is a very complicated situation.” The Secretary said that we
                        had gone quite a way to meet the Soviet points of view and up popped the
                        troika. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said they wanted to
                        correct their mistakes. Maybe they should have raised the troika before. He
                        said it would not damage the US but would protect their own interests. They
                        could not have agreements that permitted arbitrary decisions, and he thought
                        that the US had too great suspicions of the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said our distrust did not begin to match Soviet distrust for an
                        impartial administration. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        retorted that there was no such being. Was Hammarskjold one? He had been
                        pushed by the US and Western powers to demonstrate his lack of impartiality.
                        The Soviets think the two powers should try to reach agreement together. It
                        was more important for the US to agree with the Soviet Union than with
                        Hammarskjold. Now the US has an agreement with Hammarskjold but not with the
                        Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> expressed the
                        opinion that the Soviets had made a real misjudgment regarding Hammarskjold.
                        They think Hammarskjold made judgments for the sake of the US, when he
                        actually made them for what he believed to be the purposes of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. This did not really affect the proposition
                        that no great power would allow the imposition of a decision affecting its
                        vital interests.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the Security Council
                        took good decisions on the Congo. It would have been better if they had been
                        carried out. Lumumba would not have been killed, he was not a Communist. Who
                        did not let the decisions be carried out? Without the backing of the Western
                        powers Hammarskjold could not have acted as he did. The US may consider that
                        some matters can be solved without the understanding of the Soviet Union.
                        The Soviet Union does not think so. Perhaps some problems could be
                        postponed. Such a situation is not normal. One cannot rely only on a
                        majority. This might change to the US disadvantage. The troika is not so bad
                        as the US considers.<note n="4" xml:id="d86fn4">During a lull in the

                    <p>During the exchange of amenities, the President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> what part of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> he was from. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that he had been born in
                        Russia, in a village in the vicinity of Kursk, 7 to 10 kilometers from the
                        Ukrainian border, but that he had spent the early part of his life in the
                        Ukraine. In this connection, he mentioned that recently very large deposits
                        of iron ore had been found near Kursk. The deposits already prospected are
                        estimated at 30 billion tons. The general estimate of these particular
                        deposits is about 300 billion tons. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that according to US official statistics
                        total deposits of iron ore in the US are estimated at 5 billion tons. Thus,
                        he said, Soviet deposits will be sufficient to cover the needs of the entire
                        world for a long time to come.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that he wondered why then the Soviet Union was
                        interested in Laos.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that the Soviet
                        Union was not interested in Laos, but that it was the US which had created
                        the Laotian situation.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he was not sure whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and himself could reach
                        agreement on all the items under discussion, but he appreciated the
                        frankness and precision with which the positions had been stated. Yet he
                        believed that agreement could be reached on the question of Laos. Yesterday,
                        both sides had agreed that Laos was of no strategic <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0235"/>importance and was not vital to either
                            side.<note n="2" xml:id="d87fn2">See <ref target="#d86">Document
                                86</ref>.</note> However, the United States became involved in Laos
                        by treaty and other commitments. The President said that his interest was to
                        secure a cease-fire and to stop the fighting. This, he thought, would be in
                        the interest of both sides. Then a government could be secured which would
                        not be weighted in either direction. The President referred to the remarks
                        made yesterday regarding the situation in Burma and Cambodia, which appeared
                        to be satisfactory to both sides, and said that agreement on Laos should be
                        possible along the same lines. However, the first problem is to stop the
                        fighting. In our view military activities are still going on in some areas
                        of Laos. We have information that Viet Minh forces are involved, while Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that Thais were
                        involved. If the Co-Chairmen of the Conference were to instruct jointly the
                            <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to make a determination as to the
                        actual situation, the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> should go to both
                        sides and make its investigation. The President then referred to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s statement yesterday
                        in which he took issue with what he called the Dulles policy of strength.
                        The President said he wanted to change US policy in this area because Laos
                        was of no strategic importance. In the eyes of the world, both sides are
                        involved in the Laotian situation; the United States wishes to reduce its
                        involvement and hopes that the Soviet Union wishes the same. However, the
                        President continued, as President he has certain responsibilities and if he
                        changes US policy he must see that it works. The United States also wants to
                        secure a government which both sides could support. If the situation can be
                        changed, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said
                        yesterday that it should be changed, then we could proceed with other
                        matters. Laos is not so important as to get us as involved as we are.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he agreed
                        with the President's concluding remark. The Soviet Union has no commitment
                        in Laos, has never undertaken any obligations in that area, and will not do
                        so in the future. If the Soviet Union has helped Laos it has been only at
                        the request of Souvanna Phouma, who represents the only legitimate Laotian
                        Government. That Government was ousted by external forces supported by the
                        US. This is why the Soviet Union cannot recognize any other government. The
                        Soviet Union has no vested interest in Laos, either political or economic,
                        or of any other nature. That country is far from Soviet borders. In general
                        the Soviet Union has no desire of committing itself or assuming
                        responsibilities in the various geographic areas. So when the President says
                        that the United States has commitments, this makes a bad impression upon the
                        USSR. The US has no right to distribute indulgences, as it were, and to
                        interfere in the various areas of the world. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he liked the concluding part of the
                        President's remarks to the effect that the two countries should not get
                        involved. This is a correct approach but it would <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0236"/>be bad if the United States were to attempt
                        to claim special rights on the grounds that it had vested interests. If the
                        President would pardon the blunt expression, such policy stems from
                        megalomania, from delusions of grandeur. The United States is so rich and
                        powerful that it believes it has special rights and can afford not to
                        recognize the rights of others. The Soviet Union cannot reconcile itself
                        with such a situation and will not concede its own rights. The Soviet Union
                        will also help other peoples obtain their independence. This is a correct
                        policy. If we want to normalize the situation and prevent conflicts between
                        our two countries anywhere in the world, the US should not seek any special
                        rights. The Soviet Union cannot accept the thesis of “don't poke your nose”
                        because wherever the rights of the people are infringed upon, the Soviet
                        Union will render assistance to the people. This, of course, aggravates the
                        situation and the Soviet Union does not wish such a development. The
                        situation should be normalized. The US should respect the rights of other
                        peoples, the Soviet people as well as other peoples. The Soviet Union does
                        not wish to divide the world. It has no commitment anywhere other than
                        toward the Socialist countries. On the other hand, the United States has
                        spread its forces all over. But time has changed. As the President has
                        stated, the forces of the two sides are not in balance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he was making this
                        statement not for the purpose of argument but only to recognize this fact. A
                        great deal of restraint is required because the factors of prestige and
                        national interests are involved here. We should not step on each other's
                        toes and should not infringe upon the rights of other nations, small or
                        big.</p>
                    <p>The President said that, frankly speaking, he had assumed office on January
                        20th and that the obligations and commitments had been undertaken before
                        that time. Why these obligations and commitments were undertaken and what
                        factors were involved at that time is not an issue here. The United States
                        and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should adopt the policy of
                        creating a neutral and independent Laos. This is what the United States
                        wants to do. The President reiterated that he did not want to increase US
                        commitments but rather decrease them. There is no point in raking over past
                        history to which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        objects. There are some facts in past history to which the United States
                        also objects. But this is not an issue here. What is an issue here, is how
                        to secure a cease-fire and to have the fighting stop. The United States
                        wishes a government in Laos which would not be involved either with the
                        United States or with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, but would
                        rather be genuinely neutral. The US went to the Conference with the genuine
                        expectation that arrangements could be made to ensure an effective
                        verification of the cease-fire and that the next step would be the creation
                        of a truly neutral Laos. The United States does not believe that there is an
                        effective cease-fire in Laos. But whatever the facts of past history we
                        should now act in such a way as to pursue the policy of ensuring <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0237"/>a truly neutral and independent Laos, which
                        we believe is also Soviet policy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that he could
                        subscribe to everything the President had said and that he fully associated
                        himself with the President's remarks, which he liked very much. However,
                        there was one point he wanted to make. The President had said that the
                        Laotian situation was a legacy, but one could see in that situation the
                        President's own hand as well. The President had ordered that US military
                        advisers in Laos should wear US military uniforms; he had also ordered a
                        landing of Marines in Laos but the order had been rescinded.</p>
                    <p>The President interjected that there had been no order for a landing of
                        Marines. True, there had been some speculation as to what action the US
                        would take, but such an order had never been issued. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> responded by saying that he was
                        referring to press reports.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> went on to say that the
                        President's argument would be that all these commitments had been made by
                        the previous administration. However, the Soviet Government has rescinded
                        all the unreasonable decisions made by the previous governments under
                        Malenkov and Bulganin.<note n="3" xml:id="d87fn3"> Georgi M. Malenkov,

                            1958.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        recalled the argument he had had with Molotov<note n="4" xml:id="d87fn4">
                            Vyacheslav M. Molotov, Soviet Foreign Minister until May 1956.</note> on
                        the Austrian problem. As a result of his having overruled Molotov, a
                        satisfactory solution of the problem was found and the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> signed the Austrian Treaty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he was sensitive with
                        regard to US commitments. He said that the Westerners were much better than
                        the Easterners at making threats in a refined way. Every once in a while it
                        is intimated that Marines might be used. But as engineers know the law of
                        physics says that every action causes counter-action. So if the United
                        States were to send Marines, other countries might respond with their
                        Marines or with some other forces. Thus another Korea or an even worse
                        situation might result. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> repeated that he liked the President's statement
                        because it reflected the Soviet policy; in fact, the President seemed to
                        have stated the Soviet policy and called it his own. The Soviet Union could
                        guarantee that it would exert every effort to achieve a settlement. But this
                        depends not merely on our two countries but on the three forces in Laos as
                        well. Agreement between our two countries would be insufficient. However, we
                        should influence the Laotian forces so that a truly neutral government could
                        be established. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said
                        that he believed that the United States had no economic interest in Laos.
                        The President had mentioned yesterday US strategic interests in connection
                        with Taiwan. But this, as was mentioned yesterday, could mean that the
                        United States could also take <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0238"/>over
                        Crimea because that would of course improve its strategic position too. Here
                        the policies of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the US are not
                        only in contrast but even in direct conflict. Such policy should be cast
                        away and a reasonable policy should be adopted. In any event, the two
                        Foreign Ministers could discuss the details of the Laotian question. They
                        should be locked in a room and told to find a solution.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> interjected that the
                        Palais des Nations in Geneva was a big place with a lot of rooms.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he wanted to make a comment on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s statement regarding uniformed
                        US personnel in Laos. He said that this action was taken when
                        representatives of the Soviet Union and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> were discussing in Moscow the question of effecting a
                        cease-fire in Laos. When it became evident that no progress had been made
                        the action was taken in order to prevent the situation from deteriorating
                        further and to ensure a more favorable situation in which the conference
                        could proceed. This is the kind of thing that happens when both sides are
                        involved, and the United States would wish to avoid such developments.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then suggested that the
                        questions of disarmament, nuclear tests and Germany be discussed now because
                        otherwise there would not be enough time to do it.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that he wanted to make a final comment on the Laotian
                        situation. He said that he was anxious to get the US military out of Laos.
                        He had not supported and had been even reluctant to consider a landing of
                        Marines, because he recognized that such action would entail retaliation and
                        counteraction and thus peace in that area might be endangered. What he
                        wanted to see in that area was an effective cease-fire and peaceful
                        settlement. He said perhaps Mr. Khrushchev could use his influence on
                        Gromyko to persuade him to cooperate in bringing about an effective
                        cease-fire in Laos and let the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> verify
                        the cease-fire in an effective manner. That was the basis on which the
                        United States had agreed to come to the conference. The President then
                        suggested that perhaps the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> could discuss this question during lunch.<note n="5" xml:id="d87fn5">For a brief discussion of Laos at lunch, see <ref target="#d88">Document 88</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he could add
                        little to what had already been said. He agreed that a cease-fire should be
                        sought. However, other questions should not be delayed by lack of a
                        cease-fire. The point is that the situation at front lines is always
                        unstable and even a shot fired accidentally by a soldier could be regarded
                        by the other side as a violation of the cease-fire. Therefore, other
                        questions should not be made contingent upon a cease-fire. However, the
                        President should not misunderstand <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0239"/>this position. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> believes that the
                        question of a cease-fire should be handled on a priority basis, but the
                        basic question is to bring about agreement among the three forces in Laos,
                        so that the formation of a truly neutral government could be secured. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> agreed that no normal
                        conditions for settlement would exist in the absence of a cease-fire.
                        However, he was not aware of any fighting going on; if the United States had
                        contrary information, it should be verified.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> remarked that the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> was already in Laos and that it could act
                        by agreement of both sides. In response to an inquiry by the Secretary, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> clarified that what he
                        meant by both sides were the two sides fighting in Laos. The <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> should not be granted the rights of a
                        supragovernment.</p>
                    <p>The President reiterated his hope that the Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> could discuss this problem briefly
                        during lunch.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then addressed himself
                        to the question of nuclear weapon tests. He said he would not go into any
                        details because the positions of the two sides were well known. Furthermore,
                        he was not familiar with all the details of this intricate problem. However,
                        there were two basic questions: (1) the number of suspicious events to be
                        inspected and (2) organization of control. The Soviet Union cannot accept
                        such controls as have been suggested so far. The events in the Congo taught
                        the Soviet Union a lesson. Before those events the Soviet Union might have
                        signed a treaty like the one suggested. However, the events in the Congo
                        indicated that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> appears to be able to
                        act against the interests of individual states. The Congo had invited <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops and those troops acted against the
                        interests of the Congolese Government. So if there is a single chairman of
                        the control commission (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was obviously referring to the administrator) he
                        will be able to set the policy. The US would not agree to having a Communist
                        chairman and that is understandable. If it did then the Soviet Union could
                        accept a single chairman (administrator). But the Soviet Union cannot accept
                        a neutral chairman; after all, Hammarskjold is also a neutral and an
                        intelligent one at that. He is not the worst neutral possible. One should
                        try to imagine a situation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said, where he, as Prime Minister of the Soviet
                        Union, would have to subject his actions to such a commission
                        (administrator). The people of the Soviet Union would never accept such a
                        situation and if the United States wants him to be fired then it should
                        pursue this line. The Soviet Union does not seek control over the control
                        organization but it does not wish the United States to have such control
                        either. This is why the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has proposed a
                        three-man body. Such an arrangement would not be prejudicial to any of the
                        sides. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he
                        believed that the work of other international organizations should be
                        organized along the same lines. He said that the United States was now in
                        the majority in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, but times may
                        change—one cannot say when—<pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0240"/>and the
                        US may find itself in a minority. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is
                        not a parliament, it is an international organization and the majority rule
                        has no place there. Each group of countries should be equally represented,
                        so that a balance of forces be established and that no one be able to pursue
                        a policy prejudicial to any other side. Referring to the number of
                        inspections, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that
                        three inspections a year would be sufficient. A larger number would be
                        tantamount to intelligence, something the Soviet Union cannot accept. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then said that he
                        wanted to link the question of nuclear tests with disarmament. If agreement
                        could be reached on disarmament, then the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could agree to any controls and it would then drop the
                        troika arrangement and the requirement for unanimity. The Soviet position on
                        disarmament is well known; it was stated at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> still proceeds
                        on that basis. Under the conditions of general and complete disarmament
                        control must be most extensive so that no country could arm itself
                        clandestinely. If there were general and complete disarmament there would be
                        no question of espionage because there would be no armaments. Then there
                        would be no secrets and all doors must be open so that complete verification
                        could be ensured. This would include nuclear plants. In view of the fact
                        that apparently no agreement can be reached on the question of nuclear
                        tests, this question should be linked to disarmament. The disarmament group
                        should combine the two questions and work out a general plan. Given good
                        will, two years should be sufficient to develop an agreement on general and
                        complete disarmament. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        said that he could give the President an aide-memoire setting forth the
                        Soviet position on this question. (The aide-memoire was received from the
                        Soviets after the meeting.)</p>
                    <p>6 For the text of this aide-memoire, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, July 3, 1961, pp. 22-24.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he wanted to ask Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> whether he believed it to be impossible to find
                        any person that would be neutral both to the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied in the
                        affirmative.</p>
                    <p>The President then said that the result of the Soviet proposal could be
                        compared to a situation where if he were living in this room and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in the adjacent room,
                        they could not go to each other's rooms without the consent of the occupant.
                        Under such conditions, how could any of the two be certain that nothing
                        suspicious is going on in his neighbor's room. The President then said that
                        a treaty along such lines could not be confirmed by the Senate. In sending
                        any treaty to the Senate the President would have to give assurance that the
                        treaty provides if not for a fool-proof control system, at least for a
                        reasonable deterrent against violations. However, if the Soviet proposal
                        were accepted, no such assurance <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0241"/>could be given. Likewise, how could Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> give such assurance to those people in his
                        country who may think that the United States is testing clandestinely. True,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is in an advantageous
                        position because of the open way in which the United States acts.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> smiled and said: “But
                        what about Allen Dulles?<note n="7" xml:id="d87fn7"> Allen W. Dulles,
                            Director of Central Intelligence.</note> Isn't that secret?” The
                        President replied he wished it were. Furthermore, the President continued,
                        how can we inspect events in the Soviet Union if any such inspection would
                        be subject to Soviet approval? Under such an agreement any party that might
                        have tested clandestinely would simply refuse to accept inspection in the
                        area where the test had occurred.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> referred to his
                        statement about three inspections a year to verify suspicious events and
                        also noted that the President had failed to address himself to his statement
                        regarding the dropping of the troika proposal if nuclear tests were linked
                        with disarmament. If this arrangement were adopted, then full control could
                        be exercised any time and at any place. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> went on to say that a nuclear test ban alone
                        would not be very important to the national security of the people. The
                        danger of war would remain, because the production of nuclear energy,
                        rockets, and bombs would continue full blast. What people want is peace.
                        Therefore, agreement should be reached on general and complete disarmament.
                        Then the troika would be dropped and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would subscribe to any controls developed by the US, even
                        without looking at the document.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he agreed that a nuclear test ban would not of itself
                        lessen the number of nuclear weapons possessed by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the US. Nor would it reduce the
                        production of such weapons. However, a test ban would make development of
                        nuclear weapons by other countries less likely, although, of course, no one
                        can guess what will happen in the future. At this time, the United States
                        and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> possess great stocks of
                        nuclear weapons; Great Britain possesses certain quantities of such weapons
                        and France is also getting some capability. If we fail to reach agreement on
                        a nuclear test ban then other countries will undoubtedly launch a nuclear
                        weapons program. While a nuclear test ban would be no certain guarantee
                        against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, it would certainly impede such
                        proliferation. If no agreement is reached, then in a few years there might
                        be ten or even fifteen nuclear powers. So in considering this question of
                        what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> calls espionage
                        one should balance its risks against the risks involved in the proliferation
                        of nuclear weapons. If we are successful in reaching agreement on a nuclear
                        test ban then it will certainly at least put a brake on the spread of
                        nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0242"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> agreed that there was
                        some logic in the President's position and said that this was why the Soviet
                        Union had entered the negotiations. However, practice has demonstrated that
                        this logic is not quite correct because while the three powers are
                        negotiating in Geneva, France simply spits at them and goes on testing. Thus
                        if there is no link between a nuclear test ban and disarmament other
                        countries may say that they are in an unequal position and might act like
                        France. Other countries may say that if the great powers possess stockpiles
                        of nuclear weapons they should also acquire such stockpiles. On the other
                        hand, if there were disarmament, then nuclear weapons would be eliminated
                        and other countries would be in an equal position and would not have to
                        spend money on the development of nuclear weapons. General and complete
                        disarmament is the most radical means of preventing war. The Soviet Union
                        has always regarded the question of a nuclear test ban merely as a small
                        step toward general and complete disarmament. But let us now begin with the
                        main issue and include the test ban in it.</p>
                    <p>The President said he agreed that a test ban would not be a basic part, but
                        it would be a most important part. He said that the treaty as drafted now
                        provides for abrogation of the treaty if any country associated with any
                        party to the treaty should conduct tests. The United States does not support
                        French testing. We hope that once a treaty has been concluded most other
                        countries will join in it. The question of a nuclear test ban is a
                        relatively easy problem to resolve because the controls required are based
                        on scientific instrumentation, such as seismographs, etc. So why not start
                        with this relatively easy question. The President then inquired whether the
                        Soviet conception was that if we used the term general and complete
                        disarmament—or general and comprehensive disarmament as used by us last
                        year—the process would be carried out step by step with the necessary
                        parallel inspection. Or is it the Soviet view that we would simply announce
                        that goal as an objective of national policy and countries would carry out
                        inspection on their own.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied he wanted to
                        make a complaint: The President apparently had not read the Soviet proposals
                        with sufficient attention. Otherwise, he would know that the Soviet
                        proposals provide for disarmament in stages and for control in stages.</p>
                    <p>The President then inquired whether this was to be understood that, if both
                        sides accepted general and complete disarmament and agreed to reduce their
                        armed forces, the number of their aircraft or submarines, or to disarm outer
                        space, the Soviet Union would accept inspection any place in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied in the
                        affirmative, using the word “absolutely”.</p>
                    <p>In other words, the President inquired further, if general and complete
                        disarmament were accepted as a commitment of national policy <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0243"/>and a nuclear test ban were included in the
                        first stage, would that mean that the test ban would be subject to
                        inspection without a veto?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that in that
                        event he would try to persuade the President not to start with this measure
                        because it is not the most important one.</p>
                    <p>In response to the President's question what should come first, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that any other measure
                        would be acceptable, such as, for instance, prohibition of nuclear weapons,
                        prohibition of the manufacture of such weapons, or elimination of military
                        and missile bases. (At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> corrected the interpreter saying that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had not mentioned prohibition of
                        the manufacture of nuclear weapons. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> confirmed that he had mentioned this item.) The
                        Soviet proposals on disarmament contain all the details and there is logic
                        in those proposals. The proposals also provide for complete control. In any
                        event, both sides should try to reach agreement on the priority of
                        individual measures so that neither side would have its interests prejudiced
                        by the other.</p>
                    <p>The President said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        appeared to feel that a link should be established between a nuclear test
                        ban and disarmament and that these two questions are inter-related and
                        should be discussed together. We, on the other hand, believe that a nuclear
                        test ban would be if not the most important step, at least a very
                        significant step and would facilitate a disarmament agreement. There is a
                        Chinese proverb saying that a thousand-mile journey begins with one step. So
                        let us make that step.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> rejoined by saying that
                        the President apparently knew the Chinese very well but that he too knew
                        them quite well. To this the President replied that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might get to know them even
                        better. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> retorted that
                        he already knew them very well.</p>
                    <p>Referring to the President's statement about the significance of a nuclear
                        test ban, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could agree to a nuclear test ban
                        provided it was subject to the troika arrangement.</p>
                    <p>The President then said that it appeared to him that the conversation was
                        back where it had started. Therefore, he wanted to conclude this discussion
                        by saying that the United States is greatly concerned by the uninspected
                        moratorium that has been going on for three years in connection with the
                        negotiations. This indicates how long it takes to reach agreements. The
                        prospect of an indefinite continuance of a moratorium without controls is a
                        matter of great concern to the United States. Therefore, it is difficult to
                        envisage how the question of nuclear tests could be included in disarmament
                        negotiations, which we hope will be successful but which will probably
                        require a long time. Perhaps it would be best to go back to Geneva to make
                        another effort and to see what each of us should do in this matter. Perhaps
                        then the conference might be recessed <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0244"/>or some other action taken. Whether or not there is
                        agreement on nuclear tests we would start our discussions on disarmament on
                        June 19.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that he was
                        agreeable to conducting negotiations in Geneva and said that there was a
                        Soviet representative there. However, the Soviet Union could not accept such
                        controls as would be tantamount to espionage if weapons themselves were not
                        eliminated. This, in effect, is what the Pentagon has wanted all along.
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>'s open skies proposal
                        in 1955<note n="8" xml:id="d87fn8">For text of this proposal, July 21, 1955,
                            see <ref target="frus1955-57v05">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1955-1957, vol. V</ref>,
                            pp. 450-453.</note> was a part of that scheme. Now ground posts are
                        envisaged and this is also reconnaissance. The Soviet Union has agreed to
                        negotiate on a nuclear test ban in the hope of reaching agreement and
                        proceeding to general and complete disarmament. If the US refuses to accept
                        general and complete disarmament then the Soviet Union cannot agree to
                        accept such an arrangement. The Soviet Union cannot accept a situation where
                        controls would prejudice its national security and where the Soviet
                        Government would be subject to the will of a third party and would not be
                        free to act on its own.</p>
                    <p>The President said that it was obvious that if controls should turn out to be
                        prejudicial to the national interest of any of the parties to an
                        unreasonable degree, the treaty could be abrogated. The President reiterated
                        that we would begin our discussions on disarmament on June 19, which will be
                        in effect a continuation of the discussion Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> had had in New York.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> inquired whether the
                        President would agree to tie together the question of the test ban and
                        disarmament.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that he would not unless there was assurance that
                        agreement on disarmament could be reached speedily. He referred to the fact
                        that negotiations on a nuclear test ban had been in process for three years.
                        The President emphasized that the problem of espionage mentioned by Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> paled if compared with
                        the problems which would result from the development of nuclear capabilities
                        by other countries. This is bound to affect the national security of our two
                        countries, and increase the danger of major conflicts.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that if we agreed
                        on general and complete disarmament that problem would not only pale but
                        would completely disappear.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the question of Germany, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he wanted to set forth his position. He
                        said that he understands that this will affect the relations between our two
                        countries to a great extent and even more so if the US were to misunderstand
                        the Soviet position. Conversely, if the US understood the Soviet position
                        correctly our two countries <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0245"/>would
                        be brought closer together rather than be divided. Sixteen years have passed
                        since World War II. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> lost 20
                        million people in that War and many of its areas were devastated. Now
                        Germany, the country which unleased World War II, has again acquired
                        military power and has assumed a predominant position in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Its generals hold high offices in that
                        organization. This constitutes a threat of World War III which would be even
                        more devastating than World War II. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> believes that a line should be drawn under World War II.
                        There is no explanation why there is no peace treaty 16 years after the war.
                        This is why the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has suggested that a
                        peace conference be convened. In this connection, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> proceeds from the actual state of
                        affairs, namely, that two German States exist. Our own wishes or efforts
                        notwithstanding, a united Germany is not practical because the Germans
                        themselves do not want it. No delay in the matter of signing a peace treaty
                        is justifiable and only West German militarists gain from such a delay. A
                        peace treaty would not prejudice the interests of the US, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, or France; on the contrary, these interests
                        would be best served by a peace treaty. The present situation looks as if
                        the US opposes a peace treaty while the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> wants it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he wanted the President to understand
                        him correctly. He would like to reach agreement with the President—and he
                        said he wanted to emphasize the words “with you”—on this question. If the US
                        should fail to understand this desire the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will sign a peace treaty alone. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will sign a peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> if the latter so desires. If not, a peace treaty will be
                        signed with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> alone. Then the state of
                        war will cease and all commitments stemming from Germany's surrender will
                        become invalid. This would include all institutions, occupation rights, and
                        access to Berlin, including the corridors. A free city of West Berlin will
                        be established and there will be no blockade or interference in the internal
                        affairs of the city. West Berlin should have a clearly defined status. If
                        the US desires, guarantees could be given to ensure non-interference and the
                        city's ties with the outside world. If the US wants to leave its troops in
                        West Berlin, that would be acceptable under certain conditions; however, the
                        Soviet Union believes that in that case Soviet troops should be there too.
                        Likewise, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be agreeable to
                        having neutral troops stationed in Berlin. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        guarantees would be acceptable as well. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be prepared to join the US in ensuring all the
                        conditions necessary for preserving what the West calls West Berlin's
                        freedom. However, if the US rejects this proposal—and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will regard such an action as having been
                        made under the pressure of <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>—the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will sign a
                        peace treaty unilaterally and all rights of access to Berlin will expire
                        because the state of war will cease to exist.</p>
                    <p>The President said that first of all he wanted to express his appreciation of
                        the fact that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had set
                        forth his views in such a frank <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0246"/>manner. At the same time the discussion here is not only about the legal
                        situation but also about the practical facts which affect very much our
                        national security. Here, we are not talking about Laos. This matter is of
                        greatest concern to the US. We are in Berlin not because of someone's
                        sufferance. We fought our way there, although our casualties may have been
                        not as high as the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s. We are in Berlin
                        not by agreement of East Germans but by contractual rights. This is an area
                        where every President of the US since World War II had been committed by
                        treaty and other contractual rights and where every President has reaffirmed
                        his faithfulness to his obligations. If we were expelled from that area and
                        if we accepted the loss of our rights no one would have any confidence in US
                        commitments and pledges. US national security is involved in this matter
                        because if we were to accept the Soviet proposal US commitments would be
                        regarded as a mere scrap of paper. West Europe is vital to our national
                        security and we have supported it in two wars. If we were to leave West
                        Berlin Europe would be abandoned as well. So when we are talking about West
                        Berlin we are also talking about West Europe. The President said he would
                        like to see the relations between our two countries develop in a favorable
                        direction so that some arrangement could be found. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> seems to agree that the ratios
                        of power today are equal. Therefore, it is difficult to understand why a
                        country with high achievements in such areas as outer space and economic
                        progress should now suggest that we leave an area where we have vital
                        interests. How can the US agree to East Germany's preventing it from
                        exercising our rights we had won by war? The United States cannot accept an
                        ultimatum. Our leaving West Berlin would result in the US becoming isolated.
                        The President emphasized that he is not President of the US to preside over
                        isolation of his country just as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, as leader of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, would not want to see his own country isolated.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> interjected that he
                        understood this to mean that the President did not want a peace treaty. He
                        said that the President's statement about US national security could mean
                        that the US might wish to go to Moscow because that too would, of course,
                        improve its position.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that the US was not asking to go anywhere; we were not
                        talking about the US going to Moscow or of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> going to New York. What we are talking about is that we
                        are in Berlin and have been there for 15 years. We suggest that we stay
                        there.</p>
                    <p>The President continued by saying that the US was interested in maintaining
                        its position in Berlin and its rights of access to that city. He said he
                        recognized that the situation there is not a satisfactory one; he also
                        recognized that in the conversations Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had had with former President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> the term “abnormal” had been
                        used to describe that situation. However, because conditions in many areas
                        of the world are not satisfactory today it is not the right time now to
                        change the <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0247"/>situation in Berlin and
                        the balance in general. The United States does not wish to effect such a
                        change. The US is not asking the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                        change its position but it is simply saying that it should not seek to
                        change our position and thus disturb the balance of power. If this balance
                        should change the situation in West Europe as a whole would change and this
                        would be a most serious blow to the US. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would not accept similar loss and we cannot
                        accept it either. The question is not that of a peace treaty with East
                        Germany but rather of other aspects of this proposal which would affect our
                        access to Berlin and our rights there.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he was sorry
                        that he had met with no understanding of the Soviet position. The US is
                        unwilling to normalize the situation in the most dangerous spot in the
                        world. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> wants to perform an
                        operation on this sore spot—to eliminate this thorn, this ulcer—without
                        prejudicing the interests of any side, but rather to the satisfaction of all
                        peoples of the world. It wants to do that not by intrigue or threat but by
                        solemnly signing a peace treaty. Now the President says that this action is
                        directed against the interests of the US. Such statement is difficult to
                        understand indeed. No change in existing boundaries is proposed; a peace
                        treaty would only formalize them. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        wants a peace treaty because such a treaty would impede those people who
                        want a new war. Revanchists in West Germany will find in a peace treaty a
                        barrier impeding their activities. Today they say that boundaries should be
                        changed. But if a peace treaty is signed there will be no ground for
                        revision of the boundaries. Hitler spoke of Germany's need for Lebensraum to
                        the Urals. Now Hitler's generals, who had helped him in his designs to
                        execute his plans, are high commanders in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. This logic cannot be understood and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> cannot accept it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he was very sorry but he
                        had to assure the President that no force in the world would prevent the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> from signing a peace treaty. 16
                        years have passed since World War II and how long should the signing of a
                        peace treaty be delayed? Another 16 years, another 30 years? No further
                        delay is possible or necessary. As far as US losses in the last war are
                        concerned, losses are difficult to measure. Loss of a drop of blood equals
                        the loss of a pint of blood in the minds of those who shed that blood. The
                        US lost thousands and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> lost
                        millions, but American mothers mourn their sons just as deeply as Soviet
                        mothers shed tears over the loss of their beloved ones. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he himself had lost a
                        son in the last war; Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> lost
                        two brothers, and <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> a son.
                        There is not a single family in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or
                        the leadership of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> that did not
                        lose at least one of its members in the war. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> continued by saying that he wanted the US to
                        understand correctly the Soviet position. This position is advanced not for
                        the purpose of kindling passions or increasing tensions. The objective is
                        just the opposite—to remove the obstacles that stand in the way of
                        development of our relations and to <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0248"/>normalize relations throughout the world. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will sign a peace treaty and the sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> will be observed. Any violation of that
                        sovereignty will be regarded by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as
                        an act of open aggression against a peace-loving country, with all the
                        consequences ensuing therefrom.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired whether such a peace treaty would block access to
                        Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that it
                        would.</p>
                    <p>The President then said that the US is opposed to a buildup in West Germany
                        that would constitute a threat to the Soviet Union. The decision to sign a
                        peace treaty is a serious one and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        should consider it in the light of its national interests. Referring to the
                        question of boundaries, the President said that General <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had made a statement on this
                            question.<note n="9" xml:id="d87fn9">For a transcript of <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s press conference on March
                            25, 1959, when he discussed German boundaries, and his reiteration of
                            the French view on November 10, 1959, see Major Addresses, Statements
                            and Press Conferences of General Charles de Gaulle, May 19, 1958-January
                            31, 1964, pp. 41-51 and 57-70.</note> This problem has been discussed in
                        the Western world and there is some division of opinion on this matter.
                        However, the US is committed to the defense of Western Europe and has
                        assisted Western Europe in the past. The President said that one of his
                        brothers had been killed in the last war, when the US came to Western
                        Europe's assistance. If the US were driven out of West Berlin by unilateral
                        action, and if we were deprived of our contractual rights by East Germany,
                        then no one would believe the US now or in the future. US commitments would
                        be regarded as a mere scrap of paper. The world situation today is that of
                        change and no one can predict what the evolution will be in such areas as
                        Asia or Africa. Yet what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> suggests is to bring about a basic change in the
                        situation overnight and deny us our rights which we share with the other two
                        Western countries. This presents us with a most serious challenge and no one
                        can foresee how serious the consequences might be. The President said it had
                        not been his wish to come here to Vienna to find out not only that a peace
                        treaty would be signed but also that we would be denied our position in West
                        Berlin and our access to that city. In fact, the President said, he had come
                        here in the hope that relations between our two countries could be improved.
                        The President stressed he hoped that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would consider his responsibility toward his
                        country and also consider the responsibility the President of the United
                        States has toward his people. What is discussed here is not only West
                        Berlin; we are talking here about Western Europe and the United States as
                        well.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that he could
                        not understand the President's reference to Western Europe. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> does not wish any change; it merely wants
                        to formalize the situation which has resulted from World War II. The fact is
                        that West Germany is in the Western group of nations <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0249"/>and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> recognizes this. East Germany is an ally of the socialist
                        countries and this should be recognized as a fait accompli. East Germany has
                        now demarcation lines and these lines should become borders. The Polish and
                        Czech borders should be formalized. The position of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> should be normalized and her sovereignty
                        ensured. To do all this it is necessary to eliminate the occupation rights
                        in West Berlin. No such rights should exist there. It would be impossible to
                        imagine a situation where the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would
                        have signed a peace treaty with the US retaining occupation rights, which
                        are based on the state of war. The US may say that its blood was shed, but
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> shed blood too and not water.</p>
                    <p>The President interjected that our rights were based on a four-power
                        agreement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied
                        that this was so in the absence of a peace treaty, but said that a peace
                        treaty would end the state of war and those rights would therefore
                        expire.</p>
                    <p>The President said this meant unilateral abrogation of the four-power
                        agreement by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and emphasized that
                        the US could not accept such an act. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that this was not so because the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would invite the US to sign a peace
                        treaty and would sign it alone only if the US should refuse to do so. In
                        that event the US could not maintain its rights on the territory of the
                            <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The President again referred to the
                        four-power agreement, but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> considered all of Berlin to be <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> territory. The President stated this may be Soviet view but
                        not ours. If the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> transfers its rights,
                        that is a matter for its own decision; however, it is an altogether
                        different matter for the USSR to give our rights which we have on
                        contractual basis. He said that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        could not break the agreement and give US rights to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> rejoined by saying that this was a familiar point
                        of view but had no juridical foundation, since the war had ended 17 years
                        ago. In fact, President Roosevelt indicated that troops could be withdrawn
                        after two or two and a half years.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> continued by saying
                        that all the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> wants is a peace treaty.
                        He could not understand why the US wants Berlin. Does the US want to unleash
                        a war from there? The President as a naval officer and he himself, a
                        civilian although he participated in two wars, know very well that Berlin
                        has no military significance. The President speaks of rights, but what are
                        those rights? They stem from war. If the state of war ends, the rights end
                        too. If a peace treaty is signed US prestige will not be involved, and
                        everybody will understand this. But if the US should maintain its rights
                        after the signing of a peace treaty, that would be a violation of East
                        Germany's sovereignty and of the sovereignty of the socialist camp as a
                        whole. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> recalled that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had agreed that
                        the situation in Germany was abnormal. <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had said that US prestige was involved. Then the
                        possibility of an interim agreement was discussed, an arrangement that would
                        not involve the <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0250"/>prestige of our two
                        countries. Perhaps this could serve as a basis for agreement. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is prepared to accept such an arrangement
                        even now. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> says that he wants
                        unification but this is not so. As far as unification is concerned, we
                        should say that the two German governments should meet and decide the
                        question of reunification. A time limit of say 6 months should be set and if
                        there is no agreement we can disavow our responsibilities and then anyone
                        would be free to conclude a peace treaty. This would be a way out and it
                        would resolve this question of prestige, which, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said, he did not really
                        understand. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that
                        he had hoped that <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> would
                        agree subsequently at the Summit, but the forces which are against
                        improvement of relations between the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> sent the <gloss target="#t_U21">U-2</gloss> plane and the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> decided that in view of the
                        tensions prevailing as a result of that flight this question should not be
                        raised. However, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> believes that
                        time for such action is ripe now. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> expressed regret on his own behalf and on behalf
                        of his colleagues and allies at not having found understanding on the
                        President's part of the Soviet Union's good intentions and motivations. If
                        only the German question were resolved the road would be clear for the
                        development of our mutual relations. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> does not want to infringe upon anybody's interests, but
                        neither would it concede its own interests. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he believed that the US does not want
                        territorial gains although there is ideological disagreement between the US
                        and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. However, ideological
                        disagreements should not be transferred onto the plane of a devastating war.
                        He said that he was confident that people would be reasonable enough not to
                        act like crusaders in the Middle Ages and would not start cutting each
                        other's throats for ideological reasons. If the United States disagreed with
                        the Soviet proposal it should at least understand the Soviet position. The
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> can no longer delay. It will
                        probably sign a peace treaty at the end of the year, with all the ensuing
                        consequences, i.e., all obligations will come to an end. The status of West
                        Berlin as a free city will be guaranteed and complete non-interference will
                        be ensured. West Berlin will be accessible to all countries with which it
                        will want to maintain ties. However, access will be subject to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>'s control, since communication lines go
                        through its territory. If the US is concerned about what it calls freedom of
                        West Berlin, let us develop guarantees jointly or invite the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. No nation will understand the US position of
                        perpetuating the state of war with Germany. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will explain its position to the world. It wants to
                        prevent the possibility of war. If the US refuses to sign a peace treaty,
                        the USSR will have no way out other than to sign such a treaty alone. The
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> lost 20 million people in the last
                        war while the US lost 350 thousand.</p>
                    <p>The President interjected that this was why the US wanted to prevent another
                        war.</p>
                    <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0251"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> continued by saying
                        that if the US should start a war over Berlin there was nothing the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could do about it. However, it would have
                        to be the US to start the war, while the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will be defending peace. History will be the judge of our
                        actions. The West has been saying that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might miscalculate. But ours is a joint account
                        and each of us must see that there is no miscalculation. If the US wants to
                        start a war over Germany let it be so; perhaps the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should sign a peace treaty right away and get over with
                        it. This is what the Pentagon has been wanting. However, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> know very well what war means. If there is any
                        madman who wants war, he should be put in a straight jacket. Nations close
                        to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> territory know what war will mean
                        for them. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> thinks of peace, of
                        friendship, and it is happy with its trade relations with West Germany,
                        France, Great Britain and Italy. It is not by accident that trade between
                        the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is still frozen but
                        that is a problem for the US. So this is the Soviet position. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will sign a peace treaty at the end of
                        this year. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> concluded
                        by saying that he was confident that common sense would win and peace will
                        prevail.</p>
                    <p>The President said he recognized that the situation in Germany was abnormal.
                        Germany is divided today. When President Roosevelt talked about the
                        withdrawal of troops he was not able to foresee this situation or the fact
                        that our two countries would be on different sides. The US does not want to
                        precipitate a crisis; it is Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> who wants to do so by seeking a change in the
                        existing situation. The President then said the US was committed to this
                        area long before he had assumed a position of high government
                        responsibility. Now Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        suggests a peace treaty at the end of the year, which would deny our rights
                        in that city and our rights of access. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> knows very well that Berlin is much more than a
                        city and yet he makes such a suggestion. Is that a way to secure peace?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied he did not
                        understand how the signing of a peace treaty could worsen the world
                        situation. Peace is always regarded as something beneficial while the state
                        of war is regarded as something evil.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the signing of a peace treaty is not a belligerent
                        act. He had not indicated this at all. However, a peace treaty denying us
                        our contractual rights is a belligerent act. The matter of a peace treaty
                        with East Germany is a matter for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s judgment and is not a belligerent act. What is
                        a belligerent act is transfer of our rights to East Germany. West Berlin is
                        not important as a springboard. However, the US is committed to that area
                        and it is so regarded by all the world. If we accepted Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s suggestion the world would
                        lose confidence in the US and would not regard it as a serious country. It
                        is an important strategic matter that the world believe the US is a serious
                        country.</p>
                    <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0252"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wondered what he should
                        do in these circumstances. He said he believed that US intentions led to
                        nothing good. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would never, under
                        any conditions, accept US rights in West Berlin after a peace treaty had
                        been signed. He said he was absolutely convinced that the peoples of the
                        world would understand such a position. Moreover, the US had deprived the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> unilaterally of its rights and
                        interests in West Germany, it had deprived the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> of reparations in West Germany, and it had signed a
                        unilateral peace treaty with Japan. As a result of this latter action the
                        Soviet Union still has no peace treaty with Japan.</p>
                    <p>The President interjected that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had said to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> that he would have signed the treaty. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> confirmed this, while
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the fact
                        remained that the US had signed the Japanese peace treaty without the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> went on to say that the
                        US regarded all this as appropriate, but now it says what the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> wants to do is immoral. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would like to do it together with the US
                        but if the US refuses to sign a peace treaty the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will do it alone. East Germany will obtain complete
                        sovereignty and all obligations resulting from German surrender will be
                        annulled. The factor of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s prestige
                        should be taken into account. What the US wants is to retain the rights
                        gained after World War II even after a peace treaty has been signed. This is
                        a policy of “I do what I want”. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        regards East Germany as a completely sovereign state and it will sign a
                        peace treaty with it. Responsibility for violation of that sovereignty will
                        be heavy.</p>
                    <p>The President said that there is every evidence that our position in Berlin
                        is strongly supported by the people there, and we are committed to that
                        area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> says that we are
                        for a state of war. This is incorrect. It would be well if relations between
                        East Germany and West Germany improved and if the development of US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations were such as to permit solution
                        of the whole German problem. During his stay in office, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has seen many changes, and
                        changes will go on. But now he wants a peace treaty in six months, an action
                        which would drive us out of Berlin. If we accepted such a proposition we
                        would lose our ties in West Europe and would lose all our friends there. We
                        do not wish to act in a way that would deprive the Soviet Union of its ties
                        in Eastern Europe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had
                        said that the President was a young man, but, the President continued, he
                        had not assumed office to accept arrangements totally inimical to US
                        interests. The President said he was prepared to discuss any problem but Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> should take into
                        account our interests just as he says we should take into account his
                        views.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that then an
                        interim agreement should be concluded. However, no matter how long a time
                        limit such an agreement <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0253"/>were to
                        provide for, the Germans would not agree because no one wishes
                        reunification. An interim agreement would be a formal factor, it would give
                        the semblance of the responsibility for the problem having been turned over
                        to the Germans themselves. If the US does not wish such an arrangement there
                        is no other way but to sign a peace treaty unilaterally. No one can force
                        the US to sign a peace treaty but neither can the US make the Soviet Union
                        accept its claims. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        then said that an aide-memoire on the Berlin question<note n="10" xml:id="d87fn10">For text of this aide-memoire, see Department of State
                                <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, August 7, 1961, pp. 231-233.</note>
                        had been prepared so that the US could study the Soviet position and perhaps
                        return to this question at a later date, if it wished to do so.</p>
                    <p>The group then moved to the dining room for lunch.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>During lunch the following points of interest emerged:</p>
                    <p>1. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he had not had
                        the good fortune of meeting Lenin.</p>
                    <p>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> referred to the
                        obsolescence of naval surface ships such as cruisers and carriers. He said
                        that the Soviet Union had switched to the production of submarines,
                        particularly of submarines designed to combat other vessels. On the other
                        hand, US submarines are designed to attack land masses. Of course, the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has such submarines too. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then expressed the
                        view that missiles are the <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0254"/>God of
                        War today and said that they had three types of missiles in production:
                        short-range, medium-range, and inter-continental.</p>
                    <p>3. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he had heard
                        that pressure was being brought to bear on the President to resume nuclear
                        weapon tests. He said that he was under a similar pressure; however, the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will wait for the US to resume
                        testing and if the US does resume the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        will follow suit.</p>
                    <p>4. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he was placing
                        certain restraints on projects for a flight to the moon. Such an operation
                        is very expensive and this may weaken Soviet defenses. Of course, Soviet
                        scientists want to go to the moon, but the US should go first because it is
                        rich and then the Soviet Union will follow.</p>
                    <p>5. In response to the President's inquiry whether perhaps a cooperative
                        effort could be made in that direction, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that cooperation in outer space would be
                        impossible as long as there was no disarmament. The reason for this is that
                        rockets are used for both military and scientific purposes. The President
                        said that perhaps coordination in timing of such efforts could be achieved
                        in order to save money. This would not involve Soviet rockets. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that this might be
                        possible but noted that so far there had been few practical uses of outer
                        space launchings. The race was costly and was primarily for prestige
                        purposes.</p>
                    <p>6. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he had
                        read the President's defense message<note n="2" xml:id="d88fn2">For text of
                            the President's special message to Congress on the defense budget, March
                            28, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United
                                States: <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">John F. Kennedy</persName>,
                                1961</hi>, pp. 229-240.</note> and that in reading it he had thought
                        that perhaps the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should also increase
                        its land forces and artillery. The President observed that the US was not
                        planning to increase its armed forces except for 10,000 Marines to bring
                        three Marine Corps divisions up to full strength.</p>
                    <p>7. During a brief discussion of the Laotian situation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the difference between
                        the Secretary and himself was that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> wanted the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to be
                        free to go to any point in the country. On the other hand, the Soviet view
                        is that the purpose of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> is to verify
                        the cease-fire and that, therefore, the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                        should be allowed to go only to points along the front line where clashes
                        occur.</p>
                    <p>8. In his toast to the President, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he was very happy to meet the President
                        and to be able to exchange views with him. He said he preferred as much as
                        possible to have personal contacts. This is always better than to act
                        through even the best possible Ambassadors. He quoted a joke that natural
                        love is better than love through interpreters. He said that he always
                        preferred contacts and did not like to evade crucial issues. If leaders of
                        states cannot resolve the most complex problems between themselves, how can
                        officials at a lower level accomplish <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0255"/>that task. This is why he prefers personal meetings, where
                        he can listen to the position of the other side and set forth his own. He
                        said he had heard the President's position and had set forth his own. At
                        this time, apparently no understanding has been reached between the two
                        sides. However, if people could resolve all difficult questions in their
                        first meeting, no difficult questions would exist. Noting that he was
                        speaking on behalf of the Soviet Government and on behalf of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s friends in the Warsaw Pact who are
                        interested in a peace treaty with Germany, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he wanted to stress that they are for
                        peace. The President might agree or disagree with this, but, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said, he wanted to assure the
                        President that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s motives are
                        sincere. He wanted the President to understand that when the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> undertook this action, it would not be
                        directed against the US or its allies. The Soviet Union wants to remove the
                        roadblocks that stand in the way. This is a painful process and it is
                        similar to a surgical operation. However, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> wants to cross that bridge and it will cross it. Evidently
                            US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations will sustain great
                        tensions as a result of that but, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said, he is sure that the clouds will dissipate,
                        the sun will come out again and will shine brightly. The US does not want
                        Berlin, neither does the Soviet Union. It is true that US prestige is
                        involved in this matter, but the only party really interested in Berlin as
                        such is <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>. He is an intelligent
                        man but old. The Soviet Union cannot agree to having the old and moribund
                        hold back the young and vigorous. Strauss <note n="3" xml:id="d88fn3"> Franz
                            Joseph Strauss, West German Defense Minister.</note> is the most
                        aggressive-minded man in West Germany, but even a man like himself, whose
                        mind is in the eclipse, can apparently see the light. On one occasion
                        Strauss wisely admitted that he fully understood how greatly Germany would
                        suffer in a new war and how complete its destruction would be. This was a
                        very wise remark. So let us try to remove the seeds that engender conflicts.
                        Mr <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he understood
                        the President's position was a difficult one; his allies may raise the
                        question of why the US should be speaking on their behalf. However, the
                        allies of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> feel the same and are
                        jealous about their rights. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he was sure that if a US ally like
                        Luxembourg were to raise its voice, there would be no problem for the
                        President. He said he did not wish to name some of his own allies who, if
                        they were to raise a belligerent voice, would not frighten anyone. However,
                        the situation would be quite different if our two countries were to clash.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then raised his glass
                        to the solution of those problems. The President is a religious man and
                        would say that God should help us in this endeavor. For his part, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said, he wanted common
                        sense to help us find solutions to our problems.</p>
                    <p>9. In his reply, the President expressed his appreciation of this opportunity
                        to meet the Chairman and said that the reason why he had <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0256"/>been anxious to meet with him was that he
                        felt that our two countries were strong and that our peoples wanted peace
                        and continued progress toward a better life. He also felt that a meeting
                        between the Chairman and himself would be in the interest of world relations
                        generally. The President then said that while the talks had been
                        wide-ranging, he appreciated the atmosphere in which they had taken place.
                        As he had told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, his
                        ambition was to prevent a direct confrontation between the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in this era of evolution, the outcome of
                        which we cannot foresee. Such a confrontation might endanger peace.</p>
                    <p>The President said he had never underestimated the power of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and he knew Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> also realized that the US was a
                        strong country. Both have vast supplies of destructive weapons. In the past,
                        it was possible to fight wars without necessarily causing a lasting effect,
                        but the effects of a modern war would go from generation to generation.
                        Therefore, the President continued, both he and the Chairman have the
                        special obligation of carrying out their responsibilities toward their
                        peoples and their national interests in a way not endangering all. In other
                        words, there should be a basic understanding of basic and secondary
                        questions. For instance, Germany and its future is extremely important
                        because of its geographic location. Each side should recognize the interests
                        and responsibilities of the other side.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed the hope that he would not leave this meeting in
                        Vienna, a city that is symbolic of the possibility of finding equitable
                        solutions, with a problem involving national security and reputation.
                        Although in other days people with similar responsibilities failed, the
                        President said, he hoped that he and the Chairman would be able to succeed.
                        This goal can be achieved only if each is wise and stays in his own area.
                        The President concluded by recalling that last night he had asked Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> what position he had
                        occupied at the age of 44. The Chairman had replied that he was head of the
                        Moscow Planning Commission and was looking forward to becoming Chairman. As
                        far as he was concerned, the President said, he hoped to become at the age
                        of 67 head of the Boston Planning Commission and perhaps National Chairman
                        of the Democratic Party. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> interjected that perhaps the President would like
                        to become head of the Planning Commission of the whole world. The President
                        said no, only of the city of Boston.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>After lunch, the President said he wanted to have a few words with the
                        Chairman in private.</p>
                    <p>The President opened the conversation by saying that he recognized the
                        importance of Berlin and that he hoped that in the interests of the
                        relations between our two countries, which he wanted to improve, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would not present him
                        with a situation so deeply involving our national interest. Of course, he
                        recognized that the decision on East Germany, as far as the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was concerned, was with the Chairman. The
                        President continued by saying that evolution is taking place in many areas
                        of the world and no one can predict which course it would take. Therefore,
                        it is most important that decisions be carefully considered. Obviously the
                        Chairman will make his judgment in the light of what he understands to be
                        the best interests of his country. However, the President said, he did want
                        to stress the difference between a peace treaty and the rights of access to
                        Berlin. He reiterated his hope that the relations between the two countries
                        would develop in a way that would avoid direct contact or confrontation
                        between them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he appreciated the
                        frankness of the President's remarks but said that if the President insisted
                        on US rights after the signing of a peace treaty and that if the borders of
                        the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>—land, air, or sea borders—were
                        violated, they would be defended. The US position is not based on juridical
                        grounds. The US wants to humiliate the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        and this cannot be accepted. He said that he would not shirk his
                        responsibility and would take any action that he is duty bound to take as
                        Prime Minister. He would be glad if the US were to agree to an interim
                        agreement on Germany and Berlin with a time limit so that the prestige and
                        the interests of the two countries would not be involved or prejudiced.
                        However, he said, he must warn the President that if he envisages any action
                        that might bring about unhappy consequences, force would be met by force.
                            <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0258"/>The US should prepare itself
                        for that and the Soviet Union will do the same.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired whether under an interim arrangement forces in Berlin
                        would remain and access would be free. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that would be so for six months. In reply
                        to the President's query whether the forces would then have to be withdrawn,
                        the Chairman replied in the affirmative.</p>
                    <p>The President then said that either Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did not believe that the US was serious or the
                        situation in that area was so unsatisfactory to the Soviet Union that it had
                        to take this drastic action. The President referred to his forthcoming
                        meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and said the
                        latter would ask what had happened. The President said that he would have to
                        say that he had gained the impression that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was presenting him with the alternative of accepting the
                        Soviet act on Berlin or having a face to face confrontation. He had come
                        here to prevent a confrontation between our two countries and he regretted
                        to leave Vienna with this impression.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that in order
                        to save prestige we could agree that token contingents of troops, including
                        Soviet troops, could be maintained in West Berlin. However, this would be
                        not on the basis of some occupation rights, but on the basis of an agreement
                        registered with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Of course, access
                        would be subject to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>'s control because
                        this is its prerogative. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> continued by saying that he wanted peace and that
                        if the US wanted war, that was its problem. It is not the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> that threatens with war, it is the
                        US.</p>
                    <p>The President stressed that it was the Chairman, not he, who wanted to force
                        a change.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that a peace
                        treaty would not involve any change in boundaries. In any event, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will have no choice other than to accept
                        the challenge; it must respond and it will respond. The calamities of a war
                        will be shared equally. War will take place only if the US imposes it on the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. It is up to the US to decide
                        whether there will be war or peace. This, he said, can be told <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>.
                        The decision to sign a peace treaty is firm and irrevocable and the Soviet
                        Union will sign it in December if the US refuses an interim agreement.</p>
                    <p>The President concluded the conversation by observing that it would be a cold
                        winter.</p>

                    <p>On June 5, 1961, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, who had returned to Paris the previous evening,
                        briefed the North Atlantic Council and President <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De Gaulle</persName> on the meetings in Vienna. At the restricted
                        meeting of the Council at 10:15 a.m. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> circulated copies of the two Soviet aides-memoire,
                        reviewed in some detail the progress of the talks, stated that they were not
                        intended to be negotiations but rather a preliminary exchange of
                        observations on U.S.-U.S.S.R. relations, and concluded that they had
                        produced no surprises. (Polto Circular telegram 7, June 5; Department of
                        State, Central Files, 611.61/6-561)</p>
                    <p>At 3 p.m. the Secretary of State briefed <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> at the Elysee Palace. After brief reviews of the
                        discussion of Laos and disarmament, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> went into some detail on the conversations on Berlin,
                        stating that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had been
                        “quite firm on all questions dealing with Berlin,” and adding that it seemed
                        to be the main one for the Chairman. The Secretary added that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had become quite emotional at
                        some points in the discussion of Germany and seemed “to greatly fear a
                        unified and rebuilt Germany which would be an ally of the West.” When asked
                        why he thought the Chairman wanted to see President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> speculated that there was some curiosity on both sides,
                        and that the President wanted to show that the United States was prepared to
                        defend its interest. (Ibid., Conference Files: Lot 66 D 110, CF 1901)</p>
                    <p>On June 5 Assistant Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> went to Bonn to brief Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>. After an initial report on the
                        President's talks in Paris with <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>
                        immediately noted that the discussions at Vienna “had scarcely contributed
                        towards détente,” and added that it had been a “hard” meeting. The Assistant
                        Secretary then summarized the talks on Laos and disarmament before
                        concentrating on Berlin. He concluded by stating:</p>
                    <p>“If any conclusion could be drawn … it was the possibility of a developing
                        crisis on Berlin, probably after the Soviet Party Congress in October. This
                        was, however, pure speculation. The tone of the meeting was civil and
                        reasonably courteous, but the substance of what was said was hard on both
                        sides.” (Ibid., Central Files, 611.51/6-561)</p>
                    <p>While <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> were in Paris and Bonn, the
                        President had flown to London to brief the British. The President explained
                        the Soviet view on Berlin and also gave Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> an extensive account of his talks
                        with <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De Gaulle</persName> on the future of
                        Europe. (Notes on a Private Discussion, June 5; ibid., Conference Files: Lot
                        66 D 110, CF 1901) At a second meeting the President and the Prime Minister
                        discussed how to proceed on Berlin. For a record of this conversation, see

                    <p>[Here follows discussion of <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s meeting with
                            <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De Gaulle</persName>.]</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Khrushchev</p>
                    <p>The President reported that the most important subject discussed on the first
                        day had been Laos; that he and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had agreed that Laos should be neutral in the
                        same fashion as Cambodia and Burma, but that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had not appeared really much interested in Laos.
                        The most ominous discussion of the first day had been <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s doctrine of the three wars. In
                        the President's judgment, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        now feels that there is a balance in the nuclear field which prevents us
                        from using nuclear weapons for local purposes. He feels further that in
                        local engagements the shorter lines of communication and the large manpower
                        of the Sino-Soviet bloc will give it a decisive advantage—whatever number of
                        men we put in, they can put in several times as many. Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> insists upon the validity of his
                        third kind of war, namely, the war of liberation, or sacred war. The
                        President reported that in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s view Iran and South Korea were going to collapse,
                        and his own riposte with respect to Poland. The President believed that this
                        very militant Soviet effort will continue.</p>
                    <p>Returning to Laos, the President said that there had been some language
                        agreed on in the communiqué,<note n="2" xml:id="d91fn2">For text of the
                            joint communiqué, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current
                                Documents, 1961</hi>, p. 574.</note> and that perhaps something
                        would come from it. He also expressed his view that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was partly right in saying that
                        not all weaknesses in governments and danger of Communist take-over could be
                        attributed to the Communists themselves. The President reported that
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> seemed uninterested in
                            <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0261"/>Cuba. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> was not a Communist but we were
                        making him one. The President reported <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s view that the present situation was like the
                        period during the decline of feudalism and the rise of capitalism. The
                        President had answered that in that period there had been a lot of wars, and
                        we should try to prevent such a situation now, to which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that if we want war we
                        can have it. To a question from Senator Fulbright, the President replied
                        that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> seemed rather bitter
                        on Nasser and that he (the President) had written three letters to
                            Nasser,<note n="3" xml:id="d91fn3"> Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of the
                            United Arab Republic. Copies of the letters are in Department of State,
                            Presidential Correspondence: Lot 66 D 204, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</note> which seemed to produce some improvement in
                        Nasser's feeling toward the United States.</p>
                    <p>Senator Humphrey commented that perhaps we ought not to jump to the
                        conclusion that all people of this sort are going Communist, and referred to
                        the example of Qasim<note n="4" xml:id="d91fn4"> Abdul Karim Kassim, Premier
                            of Iraq.</note> in Iraq. The President then read excerpts from the
                        minutes of the conversation after lunch on Saturday, beginning on page 1 and
                        continuing through page 3. (The President specifically omitted reference to
                        his own remarks about the Cuban situation.)</p>
                    <p>Senator Dirksen asked whether there was discussion of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, and the President said there was not,
                        and repeated his view of the Soviet sense of a change in the power balance.
                        The President then read a passage relating to the Soviet view of the sacred
                        war and how the United States used to be in favor of such revolution but was
                        not any longer.</p>
                    <p>Asked about the Congo, the President reported <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s statement that his experience in the Congo was
                        what confirmed in him the necessity for the Troika. To a question from
                        Senator Fulbright about arms limitation in Africa, the President replied
                        that the matter had not been discussed. The President read from the
                        memorandum of conversation to explain Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s remarks about Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>To a question from Senator Dirksen, the President commented that there had
                        been only a brief reference to U.S. bases.</p>
                    <p>On Sunday the discussion began with nuclear testing and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had insisted on the Troika,
                        stating that there was no such thing as a neutral person. Control in such
                        circumstances was a form of espionage. There could be no serious control or
                        inspection until after the decision for complete and general disarmament had
                        been accepted. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had
                        urged that the President should agree to a merger of the test talks with
                        disarmament, and the President's conclusion was that either from Chinese
                        pressure or for other reasons the Soviets have lost interest in a test ban
                        agreement. The President replied that in his view it would be wrong to merge
                        the test ban with general disarmament since <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0262"/>for fifteen years discussion of the latter subject had
                        gotten nowhere. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that
                        when we start to test, he will start to test. The main question now was how
                        to disengage from these negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and the President had talked about this matter,
                        which was a hot issue in England. Gaitskell <note n="5" xml:id="d91fn5">
                            Hugh T.M. Gaitskell, Leader of the British Labour Party.</note> had also
                        expressed his hope that we could wait until the autumn, until after his own
                        contest for control in his own party, which he expected to win. This was a
                        problem in Canada, too, and in general a major question of propaganda
                        values. The question was how to break it off so that the Soviets would seem
                        to be responsible.</p>
                    <p>Discussion then turned to Germany, which was what, in the President's
                        judgment, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had come to talk
                        about. He gave us an aide-memoire on Germany<note n="6" xml:id="d91fn6">For
                            text of the aide-memoire on Germany, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, August 7, 1961, pp. 231-233.</note> and
                        it was on this subject, for the first time, that his voice began to rise.
                        The President read at length from the memorandum of conversation to show
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s position on Germany
                        and his own response. Senator Fulbright asked whether there was a time limit
                        on these discussions, and the President replied, “He said December.” Then he
                        read further from a memorandum of conversation and particularly emphasized
                        this sentence of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s: “The
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would never under any conditions
                        accept U.S. rights in Berlin after a peace treaty had been signed.” Senator
                        Dirksen asked three questions: (1) What is <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s physical condition? The President said it was
                        good. (2) Was there any other arrogance about him? The President said no.
                        (3) Should we expect a recognition of East Germany before December? The
                        President said that in his view there might well be a signing of a peace
                        treaty at some such time, and that the Soviets would say that all rights
                        reverted to the East Germans, although they might in fact not do anything to
                        interfere with our access (which the President noted was Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>'s belief). And as far as
                        military access was concerned, our own troops could be supplied with four
                        air sorties a day. To the question whether <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had described the period of time for which the
                        Free City would have the rights he offered, the President said that the
                        answer was not clear.</p>
                    <p>The President then quoted again from the aide-memoire to explain the Soviet
                        proposal on a Free City, and also the Soviet view that a peace treaty would
                        formally end occupation rights.</p>
                    <p>Senator <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0263"/>Humphrey asked whether East
                        Berlin had been mentioned. The President answered no.</p>
                    <p>Senator Humphrey commented further that the Soviet position seemed identical
                        with what <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> stated before,
                        and the President commented that the only new point was the time limit.
                        Senator Humphrey rejoined that even the time limit was not new, in the sense
                        that there had been time limits before. The President stated that in his
                        judgment <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was talking in
                        cold terms of a genuinely vital present interest.</p>
                    <p>Senator Saltonstall asked whether <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> seemed moved by fear of West Germany. The
                        President answered that this was what <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said, but really he was interested in the
                        build-up of East Germany.</p>
                    <p>In response to a question, the President said that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> claimed his relations with China
                        were very good.</p>
                    <p>Senator Dirksen found four propositions in this report: (1) two Germanys, (2)
                        Berlin in the middle of one of them, (3) concessions on troops and access,
                        (4) in the future, when the sovereign power says that you have to take your
                        troops home, you are sunk.</p>
                    <p>The President said that in his own speech that evening<note n="7" xml:id="d91fn7">For text of the President's radio and television report
                            to the American people on his trip to Europe, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">John F. Kennedy</persName>, 1961</hi>, pp.
                            441-446.</note> he would say the situation was serious, but not press it
                        home too sharply. We shall soon send back an aide-memoire on our own
                            rights,<note n="8" xml:id="d91fn8">For text of the U.S. reply, July 17,

                            753-760.</note> and we must consider what else we can do.</p>
                    <p>Senator Russell said that at present he would be against an airlift. The
                        President replied that we can decide when the time comes. The President
                        further reported that after lunch on Sunday, he had come back to speak to
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> again because he
                        thought he ought to know that this matter of rights of access was a most
                        vital matter to the U.S. The President said that he thought <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would indeed probably sign a
                        Peace Treaty, and we would then say simply we do not accept it.</p>
                    <p>Senator Saltonstall asked whether <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and the British were as strong as <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De Gaulle</persName> on this question. The President
                        answered that the British were not as precise. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> was ready to meet his commitments, but <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De Gaulle</persName> seemed harder—ready for war if
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>Senator Russell asked how long we have to decide. The President said we would
                        answer the aide-memoire which had much superficial attractiveness. We must
                        get our own position clear on the rights of the people of West Berlin to be
                        free. Then he thought the matter would go along until after the German
                        elections.</p>
                    <p>Senator Saltonstall asked if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> seemed confident. The President answered that he
                        thought <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> probably had a
                        knife in himself a little on this one. Not all the advantages are on his
                        side. He will have to initiate the blockade, and it will not be easy for him
                        to give the appearance of right on his side.</p>
                    <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0264"/>
                    <p>Senator Dirksen asked if the Germans were all out of Austria now. The
                        President said yes.</p>
                    <p>Senator Humphrey said that the danger in a peace treaty is that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> can disclaim responsibility so
                        that in the event of an incident—if, for example, we should have to shoot
                        down Germans—he would be peacefully out of it, and we would be appearing to
                        start warlike action.</p>
                    <p>The President said we should continue to hold the Russians responsible. We
                        have to show them that there is a very serious chance that this could lead
                        to war.</p>
                    <p>Senator Dirksen said that this was the one place where Lucius Clay<note n="9" xml:id="d91fn9">General Lucius D. Clay, U.S. Military Governor for
                            Germany during the Berlin blockade, 1948-1949.</note> fumbled—we had no
                        easement—we had to go to an airlift. There followed some discussion of how a
                        country lawyer would handle the matter.</p>
                    <p>The President asked Senator Russell what the U.S. should do if after a peace
                        treaty the East Germans should deny access. Senator Russell said this was a
                        big decision. He believed that if we are firm, it would not come to that
                        point. He asked whether a Free City could be absolutely free and independent
                        of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Senator Dirksen asked what the timetable was. The President said we ought not
                        to indicate. Senator Dirksen said the leadership ought to have time to
                        puzzle over it a couple of weeks and then give its views to the President.
                        The President said this was all right, since all we needed now was to send
                        back an aide-memoire stating our own position.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President asked if it was not fair to state that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s position as stated to the
                        President was as it has always been, while the President in turn had
                        restated our position.</p>
                    <p>Congressman McCormack asked for the President's basic impression of the man
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. The President replied
                        that he was very tough. The President had read all of his conversations with
                        President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and felt that
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then, and now, was a
                        persistent counter-puncher. He had not been disagreeable. He came to talk on
                        Germany. He wanted “to know whether we would fight” and that was why the
                        President went back after lunch to make our position very plain. Then
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had said that if there
                        was to be war, then let it come now, and the President “gave him a box of
                        Sandwich glass and left.” The President felt it was going to be very close,
                        and awfully tough. The Soviets feel that our edge is gone on the nuclear
                        side.</p>
                    <p>On Laos, the President had asked <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> how we could talk on any matter if we could not
                        agree on Laos.</p>
                    <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0265"/>
                    <p>The President said that in his speech he would give no sense of a time limit,
                        that what he would try to communicate was how the Soviets were planning to
                        operate with patience from their inside lines, hoping to pick up countries
                        which would tumble from interior weakness. In this situation, <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> were not worth a damn, and we must face a different
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>The President discussed privately with Senator Fulbright a call to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>Senator Dirksen asked about public comment. After some discussion, there
                        seemed to be agreement with the Speaker's view that all concerned would
                        simply say that the President had given a preview of what he was going to
                        say that evening. The Vice President summarized his sense of the Vienna
                        meeting by saying that “he expressed his view and we re-expressed ours.” The
                        President agreed, and there was further agreement that we should say nothing
                        that would seem to put <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in
                        a corner where he must fight back.</p>
                    <p>Senator Humphrey suggested that the President might presently stress the
                        notion of reunification of Germany—our strong point in the argument.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> to give the Council a brief account
                        of the President's recent trip to Europe.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> began by stating that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had made a great
                        impression on <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, his
                        understanding of French problems, <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0266"/>and that the President had stood up to <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> “full face”. He mentioned that about all that was
                        really accomplished, however, was a decision to work out a mechanism for
                        consultation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> gave a brief account of the
                        proceedings of the talks in Vienna. (This account followed the lines of
                        information presented in the Secretary's cables on the meeting.) He
                        discussed the details of the Soviet aide-memoire on Berlin and said that
                        nothing had really been gained or lost on the problem of Berlin. He
                        mentioned that Khrushchev was willing to hold the Vienna meeting because he
                        wanted to get across the contents of the aide-memoire and to inform us that
                        his policy had not changed with regard to the Troika inspection formula. He
                        said that the meeting had gone off rather much as expected and that it was
                        worthwhile from the standpoint that (1) it had solidified positions that
                        needed to be solidified; (2) <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>
                        had been very pleased at our standing up to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>; (3) <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had made a
                        great hit among the Europeans; and (4) <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had, undoubtedly, been impressed with President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s popularity. He said
                        that he also thought that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        had been impressed with President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s general ability.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> whether President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had discussed the Washington-Moscow
                        direct telephone link with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, to which <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> replied in the negative.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> went on to say that the
                        Russian position on Berlin was essentially a very weak one and that he
                        thought that <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> should submit a proposal for
                        handing over the Berlin question to the <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss>
                        to test whether a war-time power could unilaterally hand over its treaty
                        responsibilities to a non-participant. He mentioned that considering
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s various deviations
                        from his firm statement in 1958 on the Berlin situation<note n="2" xml:id="d92fn2">Presumably <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>
                            is referring to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s

                        was difficult to tell whether he was now bluffing or how, but that if the
                        Russians set a time limit at the Party Congress in October on settlement of
                        the Berlin question, this would be a sign that they were not bluffing.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> said that there was no hint
                        of a <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-Chinese schism at the meeting. He
                        said that nothing had been mentioned about another meeting. He ended by
                        saying that on the whole this meeting had a great psychological impact and
                        benefit in Europe.</p>

                    <p>1972. In discussing <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> meeting with local officials and diplomatic
                        colleagues, US officials should draw on President's radio and TV address
                        June 6, stressing particularly following points:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">President's Assessment of Meeting</p>
                    <p>Talks somber but useful. No advantage or concession gained or given. No major
                        decisions taken. Views two leaders contrasted sharply. However, channels of
                        communication between governments opened more fully. Chances of dangerous
                        misjudgment on either side should now be less.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Future US-Soviet Contacts</p>
                    <p>a. Joint communiqué June 4 noted agreement “maintain contact on all questions
                        of interest to two countries and for whole world.”</p>
                    <p>b. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did not, however, extend
                        formal invitation to President to visit <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. While he did say President “would be very welcome” to
                        come to Moscow he did not place invitation in time context. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, therefore, does not regard this as
                        invitation and no plans exist for such visit.</p>
                    <p>c. US expects contacts will continue through normal diplomatic channels,
                        including, from time to time, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> meetings
                        like that of March 18,<note n="2" xml:id="d93fn2">See <ref target="#d47">Document 47</ref>.</note> but two parties did not attempt schedule
                        specific future meetings.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Germany-Berlin</p>
                    <p>Both sides restated their positions on Germany and Berlin, without narrowing
                        differences. In particular, President made clear US determination uphold all
                        Western rights, including that of access, in Berlin. President emphasized
                        rights Western powers in Berlin not exercised on sufferance <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and could not be terminated unilaterally.
                        Interference with access would be belligerent act. Security Western Europe
                        and of US deeply involved.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Geneva Test-Ban Negotiations and Disarmament</p>
                    <p>Hopes for end to nuclear testing, spreading of nuclear weapons, and slowing
                        down arms race “struck a serious blow” by Vienna discussions. Although
                        President strongly pressed case for concluding nuclear test <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0268"/>ban treaty both for its own sake and as
                        important contribution to future progress in broader areas of disarmament,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> made it clear present
                        test-ban talks appeared futile and showed no interest in responding to
                        initiatives taken by US since these talks resumed in March.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> indicated Soviet
                        “three-headed monster” concept basic element of Soviet policy. This raises
                        fundamental questions as to feasibility reliable control measures in
                        disarmament field, whether test ban or general disarmament. From discussions
                        evident secrecy continues to be of strategic importance to Soviets.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> made it clear that
                        until there is sweeping general disarmament, he regards our insistence on
                        far-reaching control provisions pretext for espionage.</p>
                    <p>President did not encourage Soviet suggestion that testing problem be merged
                        with general disarmament negotiations due begin July.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Laos</p>
                    <p>Soviets concurred in joint communiqué reaffirming two parties' support “of
                        neutral and independent Laos under Government chosen by Laotians themselves,
                        and of international agreements for insuring that neutrality and
                        independence,” and reluctantly agreed to recognize “importance of effective
                        cease-fire.” While these statements commit Soviets publicly, they do not
                        guarantee change in Soviet policy or mean Soviet influence will be used
                        energetically with Pathet Lao to bring about genuine cease-fire. US watching
                        Soviet and Pathet Lao actions closely and will shape policy and actions in

                    </list>
                    <p>In the period since early 1956 the Soviets have transformed the concept and
                        phrase, “peaceful coexistence,” into a useful political tool by assiduous
                        and continuous propagation at all levels of the government and party
                        apparatus. They have gained abroad a substantial measure of acceptance of
                        this concept as a legitimate objective, not only of their foreign policy but
                        of other countries. It appears as such in repeated joint communiqués of the
                        Soviet Union and other countries and all too frequently in the speeches and
                        conversations of leading political figures, particularly but not
                        exclusively, from the uncommitted countries.</p>
                    <p>We have attempted to combat it by pointing out both the hypocrisy and true
                        meaning of its major tenets and by indicating that it is nothing more than a
                        Soviet rationalization for using every measure of struggle against the free
                        world except nuclear warfare. Toward this end we have made occasional public
                        speeches and have instructed our posts abroad to disseminate our views of
                        it. This has been manifestly inadequate. In the field of propaganda one
                        simply can not beat something with nothing.</p>
                    <p>We have needed a single, simple countertheme if we are to do the job. After a
                        long study of the possible alternatives, we have concluded that “peaceful
                        world community” is the most effective phrase we can find. Although this
                        phrase seems to embody the essence of our basic foreign objectives, we
                        recognize that neither it nor any other single phrase will magically
                        accomplish our purposes. If, however, we devote the same degree of attention
                        and effort to it that the Soviets give to “peaceful coexistence,” we should
                        be able to invest it with meaningful content, achieve an increasing measure
                        of understanding of the difference between our and the Soviet concept and
                        have some success in associating other countries with our view. “Peaceful
                        world community” also helps us in our efforts to emphasize that “general and
                        complete disarmament” is not an end in itself but an important component of
                        a larger aim. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">John McCloy</persName> quite
                        independently used the exact phrase for that purpose in his conversation
                        with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2">Not further identified.</note>

                        we will give some thought as to how it can be most auspiciously

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Overall U.S.-Soviet Relations</p>
                    <p>1. President began talks with expression of hope conversations would be
                        useful and provide better understanding of problems confronting the two
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>2. President said common objective should be to conduct competition of two
                        systems without endangering peace. Problem is to find means of avoiding
                        situations in which two countries become committed to actions involving
                        their security. President stressed this point repeatedly.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> stated desire for
                        improved relations but not at expense other people. Referred to lack of
                        direct conflict in economic field. Stressed need for solution basic
                        questions, failing which tensions would continue: West must recognize de
                        facto that Communism exists and has <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0271"/>won right to develop. In luncheon toast <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> decried idea of mutual concessions in
                        negotiation, asking what could he concede and saying concession of even a
                        portion of peace would mean no peace at all.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> expounded on eventual
                        Communist triumph through spread of ideas; claimed challenge lay in force
                        economic example and in political arena; gave “guarantee” <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would not try to propagate ideas by use
                        of nuclear missiles; denied intent to use force of arms or impose its system
                        on others.</p>
                    <p>5. President said <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> seeks to eliminate
                        free system while objecting to any efforts of others to eliminate Communist
                        system in the bloc. Rejected idea of historical inevitability of Communist
                        triumph, defended the right of free popular choice.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> tried to interpret the
                        President's position as an effort to justify resort to arms to oppose the
                        spread of Communist ideas.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">“Miscalculation”</p>
                    <p>1. President outlined mutual danger of miscalculation. Cited historical
                        examples and emphasized importance of considering views and positions of
                        other side before embarking on a course of action.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said miscalculation is
                        vague term, Soviets can not guarantee Communist ideas won't spread. Term can
                        be applied to both sides. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will defend
                        its vital interests, can not be intimidated. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> appreciates loss to both sides which war would bring but
                        use of term “miscalculation” does not affect the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">China</p>
                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> brought up China but
                        stated he was not authorized to speak for the Chinese Communists. Urged the
                        President to adopt a “reasonable” course by recognizing the Chinese
                        Communists. Termed Chinese Communists' exclusion from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> “unrealistic” but said Chinese Communists
                        would never join the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> if the Chinese
                        Nationalists were still there.</p>
                    <p>2. He termed present U.S. policy toward Chinese Communists unreasonable and
                        said it might ultimately lead to war. Urged the U.S. to settle its problems
                        with the Chinese Communists and end the “occupation” of Taiwan.</p>

                        changes in U.S.-China policy but President left him under no illusions that
                        change could be expected. The President cited the constant hostility of the
                        Chinese Communists towards the U.S. and acknowledged U.S. relations with
                        Chinese Communists were indeed bad. He stressed that U.S. strategic
                        interests were involved in the U.S. position on Taiwan and said that he
                        considered the security of the U.S. involved as well.</p>

                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> denied responsibility
                        for popular uprisings against “tyrannical regimes” and charged U.S.
                        supported military dictators and opposed social change. Cited Cuba, Iran,
                        Pakistan, South Korea, Turkey, Spain, Angola. He said <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> supports the aspirations of the
                        people.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> referred to Cuba, said
                            <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> is not a Communist but U.S.
                        policy could make him one. Termed President's statement that U.S. security
                        threatened dangerous. If U.S. free to act in Cuba, what of Turkey and Iran;
                        miscalculation possible in such situation.</p>
                    <p>3. President explained U.S. attitude toward Cuba, stressing <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>'s destruction of right of free choice
                        and his stated intent to use Cuba as base for expansion in neighboring
                        area.</p>
                    <p>4. President asked Soviet attitude should West-oriented government be
                        installed in Poland, said social and political changes in the world should
                        take place in ways not involving national security, treaty commitments or
                        prestige of two countries.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> would be removed as Batista was if he
                        failed to give the Cubans freedom. Our countries should not intervene. Added
                        that under influence of Soviet aid <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> might turn Communist but <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could not now see which way <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> would go.</p>
                    <p>6. President sketched three U.S. interests: free choice through elections for
                        all people; defense of our strategic interests (Spain, Yugoslavia); events
                        in next decade not greatly disturbing the balance of power (referred to
                        effect of Chinese Communist development of military potential).</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Colonialism</p>
                    <p>1. President expressed support for liberation movement in Africa, noted we
                        had rankled allies to sustain this position.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied U.S. position is
                        basically anti-liberation, pro-allies.</p>
                    <p>3. President referred to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        January speech and support of wars of national liberation. Stated that
                        problem was how to avoid direct contact between two countries as we support
                        respective groups; referred to Viet-Nam guerrilla activity and said we do
                        not believe they represent popular will.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said people's only
                        recourse often to arms, cited Algeria and Angola. Called them “sacred” wars.
                        Affirmed Soviet support but tried to deny direct Soviet participation.</p>
                    <p>5. President said we were concerned also with what followed nation-hood in
                        such areas. Balance of power could be disturbed if they associated closely
                        with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> charged this meant U.S.
                        could not recognize neutrality unless it followed U.S., said that if some
                        African country went <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0273"/>Communist this
                        would be expression of popular will and our interference could set off chain
                        reaction and lead to war.</p>
                    <p>7. President said situation in Burma, India and Yugoslavia satisfactory to
                        us.</p>
                    <p>8. President referred again to Poland to illustrate problem of close
                        association of neighboring country with antagonistic power. Mentioned the
                        question of popular support and this led to pointed exchange with Khrushchev
                        on question of popularity of Polish Government.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Laos</p>
                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said both sides
                        supplying arms in Laos. Side <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        supporting has popular support and would win out, like Mao vs. Chiang in
                        China.</p>
                    <p>2. Both agreed Laos not strategically very important, but President noted our
                        treaty commitments in the area and with reference to Laos.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> took exception to
                        reference to commitments, said U.S. could not assert special rights and
                        dispense indulgences, as forces in world now in balance.</p>
                    <p>4. President noted U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had
                        expressed desire for neutral and independent Laos, referred to Cambodia and
                        Burma to illustrate meaning of those terms. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> assented.</p>
                    <p>5. President emphasized primary need for effective verification of
                        cease-fire, citing reports of violation and need for new instructions to
                            <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> digressed on
                        anti-popular regimes again and said U.S. talks too much of anti-guerrilla
                        warfare and such talk dangerous. Said guerrilla success dependent on local
                        support, could not be gained from outside the country. Interference from
                        outside could bring war and terrible prospect of mutual destruction.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would not agree to <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> becoming a kind of supra-government; three
                        sides must agree among themselves regarding a cease-fire and U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could use influence to bring agreement
                        about. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> added <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> could act by agreement of Laotian parties.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said basic question of
                        formation of Laotian government should not be contingent on a
                        cease-fire.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> alleged and President
                        denied U.S. had ordered and then recalled order for a Marine landing in
                        Laos.</p>
                    <p>9. President stressed need of avoiding a situation which could lead to
                        retaliation and counter-retaliation and thus endanger peace.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Nuclear Testing</p>
                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said two basic questions
                        were: (1) number of suspicious events to be inspected and (2) organization
                        of control.</p>
                    <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0274"/>
                    <p>2. Since events in the Congo the Soviet Union cannot accept proposed
                        controls. Single administrator could set policy and Soviet Union could not
                        accept neutral chairman as no person truly neutral.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said three inspections a
                        year sufficient, greater number would be gathering of intelligence.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> favored linking nuclear
                        test question with disarmament. If disarmament agreement reached, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could accept any controls and would then
                        drop Troika proposal and the requirement for unanimity. Two years should be
                        sufficient to develop general and complete disarmament agreement.</p>
                    <p>5. President said testing treaty along lines <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> proposed would not provide reasonable deterrent
                        against violations and he could not send it to the Senate.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said test ban alone not
                        important to national security if weapons production continued.</p>
                    <p>7. President stressed effect on proliferation of nuclear weapons and
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said this was why
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had entered negotiations.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said in absence of link
                        between test ban and disarmament other countries may say they are in unequal
                        position and test weapons like France is doing.</p>
                    <p>9. President stressed treaty provisions for abrogation if other parties
                        tested and noted relevant ease of controls on testing because they are based
                        on scientific instrumentation.</p>
                    <p>10. (<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> defended the Soviet
                        proposals for a tripartite administrator at great length in separate
                        conversations with the Secretary.)</p>
                    <p>11. President said test ban would at least be very significant step and would
                        facilitate disarmament agreement.</p>
                    <p>12. President said prospect of indefinite continuance of uncontrolled
                        moratorium is a matter of great concern to U.S. Difficult to see how test
                        ban could be included in disarmament negotiations which will probably
                        require a long time. Perhaps we should make another effort at Geneva or
                        recess the conference.</p>
                    <p>13. The President stated we would begin bilateral discussions on June 19
                        whether or not there was an agreement on nuclear testing. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> agreed to continued Geneva
                        negotiations but reiterated <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could not
                        accept controls tantamount to espionage if weapons themselves were not
                        eliminated.</p>
                    <p>14. In response to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        question, President said he would not agree to tie test ban question to
                        disarmament unless there was assurance disarmament agreement could be
                        reached speedily. He said espionage problem insignificant in comparison with
                        consequences of development of nuclear capability by other countries.</p>
                    <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0275"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Disarmament</p>
                    <p>1. In response to President's question, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said Soviet disarmament proposals provided for
                        proceeding by stages and for control in each stage.</p>
                    <p>2. President inquired whether if general and complete disarmament accepted as
                        a commitment of national policy and a nuclear test ban was included in the
                        first stage would test ban be subject to inspection without veto.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that he would
                        try to persuade President not to start with test ban as it not the most
                        important measure. He said any measures, such as prohibition nuclear
                        weapons, prohibition of manufacture of such weapons or elimination of
                        military or missile bases, could come first.</p>
                    <p>4. In separate luncheon conversation <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said cooperation in outer space projects would be
                        impossible without disarmament.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Germany and Berlin</p>
                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> attacked German
                        militarism and said no delay in signature of a peace treaty was justifiable.
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> wanted agreement with U.S. but in
                        its absence would sign a separate peace treaty with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, the state of war would cease and all commitments,
                        including rights, institutions and allied access would become invalid. U.S.
                        troops could stay in Berlin under certain conditions; Soviet troops should
                        also be there and neutral troops under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        guarantee would be acceptable.</p>
                    <p>2. The President contrasted Berlin with Laos. He said we fought to get to
                        Berlin. Our national security is affected by what happens there, and we have
                        contractual rights to which every President involved has reaffirmed his
                        obligations. If we allowed ourselves to be expelled from Berlin no one could
                        have confidence in our commitments and this deeply involves our national
                        security. He, no more than <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, is prepared to preside over isolation of his own
                        country.</p>
                    <p>3. President rejected <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        charge that reference to national security signified U.S. wanted to improve
                        its position. The U.S. was not pushing but was interested in maintaining
                        position in and access to Berlin. Situation might be unsatisfactory but
                        situations elsewhere unsatisfactory and this not the right time to change
                        Berlin situation. Neither U.S. nor <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        could accept the change in balance of power that would result from Soviet
                        proposal.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> defended peace treaty as
                        restraint on German revanchists. Said no force could prevent <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> signing treaty. <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sovereignty would then be established and its violation
                        regarded by <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as open aggression.</p>
                    <p>5. In reply to President's question, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> specifically said allied access to Berlin would
                        be blocked by peace treaty. President reiterated <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0276"/>that our views and interests should be carefully considered
                        and said <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had laid down a
                        most serious challenge with unforeseeable consequences. Expressed hope
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would consider both
                        his and President's responsibilities toward their own countries.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> maintained <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> wished only to formalize existing

                        occupation rights after a peace treaty was impossible to imagine.</p>
                    <p>7. President said Soviet Union cannot give U.S. rights to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> prepared to accept interim agreement not

                        months time limit for Germans to solve question of reunification. Then U.S.
                        and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could disavow responsibilities and
                        anyone would be free to conclude a peace treaty. He expressed confidence
                        that our people would not start cutting each other's throats for ideological
                        reasons. Said <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> can delay no longer,
                        will probably sign peace treaty at the end of the year. He later
                        specifically referred to December.</p>
                    <p>9. Later <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be defending peace if the U.S.
                        started a war in Berlin. U.S. should avoid miscalculation, but if U.S. wants
                        war over Germany let it be so. He was confident common sense would gain the
                        upper hand and peace prevail.</p>
                    <p>10. The President denied any wish to precipitate a crisis but stressed our
                        profound commitment in Berlin. It is strategically important that the world
                        believes the U.S. a serious country whose commitments one could rely on.
                        Said signing of a peace treaty not a belligerent act but denial of our
                        contractual rights would be.</p>
                    <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would not accept U.S. rights in Berlin
                        after a peace treaty and was convinced the world would understand the Soviet
                        position.</p>
                    <p>12. The President said our position in West Berlin was strongly supported by
                        the people there. President is prepared to discuss any problem between us
                        but we should take carefully into account each other's views and interests.
                        He did not assume office to accept arrangements totally inimical to U.S.
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>13. Referring to an interim agreement <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said it would be a formal factor giving the
                        semblance of turning the problem over to the Germans. He referred to the
                        aide-memoire (later handed to U.S. officials) <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0277"/>and concluded U.S. could study it and perhaps return to the
                        question later if it wished.<note n="2" xml:id="d95fn2">At its meeting on

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Nuclear Test Talks</p>
                    <p>Soviet delegate Tsarapkin at the Geneva test talks has dropped all pretense
                        of serious interest in concluding an agreement and is seeking to induce the
                        US and Britain to take the initiative in terminating the negotiations. He
                        charged on 12 June that the West now is interested only in ending the talks
                        and placing the blame on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>At the same session Tsarapkin formally introduced the Soviet aide-memoire of
                        4 June on nuclear testing which was handed to the US at the conclusion of
                        the President's talks with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        in Vienna.<note n="2" xml:id="d96fn2">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1961</hi>, pp. 162-166.</note> This
                        memorandum proposed that, in view of the failure to reach an agreement on a
                        test ban, the powers take up the “cardinal question” of general and complete
                        disarmament and settle the disarmament and nuclear test problems
                        interdependently.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet memorandum stated that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        would agree to sign a general disarmament treaty including Western proposals
                        on the cessation <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0278"/>of nuclear testing
                        and implied that a test ban could be part of the first stage of such a
                        treaty. Tsarapkin contended that these proposals demonstrated the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s flexibility and “constructive approach”
                        and denied any intention of issuing an ultimatum. He stressed, however, that
                        the West has the choice of either signing a test ban treaty on Soviet terms
                        or merging these talks with negotiations on general disarmament.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet proposal is clearly aimed at prolonging the present uncontrolled
                        moratorium on testing. Moscow probably also calculates that the opening of
                        bilateral Soviet-US disarmament talks on 19 June and the international
                        conference on general disarmament scheduled to begin on 31 July in Geneva
                        will act as a brake on any US move to resume nuclear weapons tests this
                        summer.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet move to terminate separate negotiations on the nuclear test issue
                        by submerging them in the complex subject of general disarmament probably
                        springs from two main considerations. Now that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has restored top-level contact with the US by his
                        meeting with the President, which he believes will open the way for
                        negotiations on the key political issues of Berlin and Germany, he has no
                        further interest in keeping the test talks alive as a means of promoting an
                        accommodation with Washington. Another and probably more important
                        motivating factor is Communist China's long-standing opposition to a test
                        ban without the complete destruction of all existing nuclear weapon
                        stockpiles—a condition which Peiping insists on in order to preclude a test
                        ban agreement. [Here follows further discussion of the nuclear test
                        talks.]</p>

                    <p>On June 19, 1961, Admiral Burke, Chief of Naval Operations, forwarded to
                        Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> a memorandum
                        of the same date to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in which he argued that
                        Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may have
                        “deliberately raised the alarm on Berlin in order to seek concessions
                        elsewhere. One of the most dangerous areas for seeking such a concession
                        would be Southeast Asia. He may envision a relaxation of the Berlin crisis
                        in exchange for an understanding that the U.S. would not forcefully resist
                        further Communist expansion in Southeast Asia.” For text of Burke's

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Statement of the Problem</p>
                    <p>Can US economic policy with respect to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the dominated countries of Eastern Europe be modified
                        to serve US interests more effectively? If so, what modifications are
                        desirable and how, when and under what circumstances should they be
                        accomplished? Particular attention should be given to the specific trade
                        controls which might be useful in bargaining for meaningful concessions from
                        the Soviet Bloc. All of these questions should be considered in the broader
                        context of economic relations with the bloc, including credits,
                        relationships with our allies, and effect upon our objectives in the
                        less-developed countries. The adamant and militantly aggressive policies of
                        Communist China and the dominated areas of Asia toward the US, leave little
                        room for maneuver in the economic field. Consequently, this paper does not
                        deal with that area.</p>
                    <p>A. The Basic Factors in the Current Situation</p>
                    <p>1. Economic relations and the conflict of systems.</p>
                    <p>The US and the Free World have entered a new phase in relations with the
                        Soviet Union and the European satellites, in which economic competition
                        looms large and in which our use of economic tools has broad political and
                        psychological consequences throughout the world, as well as in the Bloc. The
                        new phase in East-West relations requires a new look at the principal
                        factors of the current situation and the net effectiveness of our economic
                        policy toward the Soviet Bloc in support of other elements in our foreign
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>2. The long-term struggle.</p>
                    <p>Given the military, political and other elements of Free World strength which
                        limit the likelihood of total war, this new look must be in <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0280"/>the perspective of conflict over the
                        long-run. In practical terms this long-term struggle will be waged in the
                        constantly changing perspective of short-run improvements in global
                        influence and power.</p>
                    <p>3. Superior US and Free World economic strength.</p>
                    <p>Superior Free World strength is a dominant factor at the present time. In
                        order to secure the future, US and Western economic strength at home and in
                        the international sphere must be used with confidence and with some
                        calculated risk, to meet Soviet moves to undermine our economic and social
                        institutions.</p>
                    <p>4. Bloc objectives and tactics.</p>
                    <p>The timely growth of economic power at home and its extension abroad are
                        regarded by the Bloc as major political objectives. The Soviet Union tends
                        to use its economic power as a deliberate instrument of political influence
                        and world leadership. Its persistent and varied attacks on the US are also
                        designed to undermine world confidence in our good faith and economic
                        capabilities. It attempts to weaken ties between the less-developed
                        countries and the rest of the Free World, and to work over the long-run for
                        isolation of the US from its allies. The dominated countries have shared
                        these objectives and tactics under Soviet leadership.</p>
                    <p>At the same time there are weaknesses in the Soviet approach not only in the
                        spotty development of its economy, but also in terms of strains on relations
                        within the Bloc, and its dependence on Western technology for accelerated
                        advancement of its economic power base.</p>
                    <p>5. US economic policies.</p>
                    <p>US economic policies have served broad US interests, but the instruments in
                        the hands of the Executive Branch have lacked the flexibility to serve US
                        interests in specific cases, particularly in dealings with the European
                        satellites. These policies have advocated increased trade in peaceful goods
                        within the limitations of that inflexibility and the practical difficulties
                        of trading with the Bloc. In general, US economic policies toward the Bloc
                        have been policies of denial. Actual trade has been insignificant.</p>
                    <p>(a) Effect on the Bloc. Multilateral controls on critical goods and
                        technology have had some effect in delaying development of certain important
                        areas of the Bloc economic power base. Unilateral US controls (with
                        relatively minor exceptions) have had little direct effect. The denial of US
                        credit and the degree to which industrialized countries have limited credits
                        to the Soviet Bloc, have limited Soviet Bloc imports of capital equipment
                        for economic development.</p>
                    <p>(b) Effect on the Free World. The principal effect of US restrictions and
                        urging our industrialized allies to adopt them, has been one of resentment.
                        Some of them regard US economic policies toward the Bloc as being
                        unnecessarily defensive and restrictive. Differences of view are an <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0281"/>increasing cause of friction,
                        particularly with respect to extension of US controls to American-owned
                        firms in their countries.</p>
                    <p>Our allies in the less-developed world have generally given tacit support to
                        US policies as an integral part of a common policy of resist-ance to Bloc
                        political and economic incursions.</p>
                    <p>The effect on uncommitted less-developed countries has been largely
                        psychological in the resentment of US controls which some view as
                        infringements on their sovereignty and in the concern aroused as to the
                        possible contribution of such controls to increased world tension. However,
                        on the material side, some less-developed countries are also concerned about
                        the potential injury to their trade if the US were to increase trade with
                        the Bloc.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. US Objectives and East-West Economic Policy
                        Changes</p>
                    <p>1. The basic objective.</p>
                    <p>The basic objective of US policy and actions in East-West economic relations
                        is to strengthen our posture while using economic relations as tools to cope
                        with growing competition from Soviet Bloc economic power and to contribute
                        to sound relations generally with the Bloc and the Free World. Flexibility
                        is an essential ingredient in the successful application of our economic
                        tools in support of our total foreign policy. Flexibility does not mean mere
                        relaxation of restrictions; it means increasing Executive Branch freedom of
                        maneuver so that we can exploit opportunities in different ways from time to
                        time in furtherance of US and Free World interests. It means a change in
                        policy to one of maneuverability by eliminating the rigidities of some of
                        our present laws and administrative restrictions bearing on East-West
                        economic relations. This flexibility is needed for practical effect in the
                        actual bargaining for meaningful short and long-term concessions from the
                        Bloc.</p>
                    <p>Our objectives in making most effective use of our economic relations should
                        be:</p>
                    <p>(a) to contribute to the image of US and Free World initiative, confidence,
                        objectivity and integrity;</p>
                    <p>(b) to reach substantial agreement with our allies on the nature of the
                        Soviet threat, its techniques and the role of Western economic tools in
                        various fields;</p>
                    <p>(c) to improve the climate for growth of economic and other institutions in
                        less-developed countries, which strengthen their political freedom and
                        foster economic growth; and</p>
                    <p>(d) to strengthen US presence in selected dominated countries of Eastern
                        Europe and to provide them with an alternative to dependence upon the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0282"/>
                    <p>2. Resume of major recommendations.</p>
                    <p>(a) Trade. It is recognized that there is a limited potential for bringing
                        allied practice on East-West economic controls into conformity with US
                        desires. The maximum possible reconciliation of US and allied policies is
                        imperative for the achievement of broader objectives and for increasing the
                        effectiveness of the Western response to the over-all Soviet Bloc threat.
                        The contribution which the changes proposed would make in reconciling
                        differences between US policies and those of our Western allies is an
                        important element in improving the effectiveness of US actions. With
                        flexibility in the hands of the Executive, and substantial agreement with
                        our allies, trade could be used as one tool in the total confrontation. The
                        estimates of increased US trade with the Bloc (given the elimination of most
                        restrictions, except for Government credits) indicate that it would not be
                        significant in relation to the total trade of the Bloc, but would be to
                        their net technological advantage.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">(1) Export Controls</p>
                    <p>1. The United States' embargo list used by the Department of Commerce should
                        be made identical with the international <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> embargo list. All other goods (except those on the
                        “general license” list) would still be subject to individual export
                        licensing for shipment to the Soviet Bloc with a general rule for approval
                        except in those special cases covering equipment or technology closely
                        related to military items or to the production thereof where denial by the
                        US would effectively prevent Soviet Bloc acquisition from any Free World
                        source of that equipment or technology, or equipment or technology
                        substitutable therefor. For those commodities which do not meet the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> strategic criteria but whose export
                        would constitute so significant a contribution to Soviet economic
                        development and to Soviet potential for economic penetration as to be
                        damaging to broad considerations of Western defense planning, the United
                        States might propose that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> consider
                        such special situations and, if it agrees that multilateral control action
                        is or might be desirable, request <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> to
                        develop a program for the institution of controls when judged necessary.</p>
                    <p>2. In discussions of trade with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                        the dominated countries of Eastern Europe, the US should be prepared (taking
                        into account the special circumstances involved in the case of each country
                        of the area) to consider the approval of export licenses up to specified
                        annual levels for certain types of goods in which the particular Bloc
                        country is interested. Such commitments could then be included in any
                        agreements which might be concluded with Bloc countries on trade or other
                        economic matters. The US Government would have no obligation to approve
                        exports of items not listed in the agreement or in excess of the quotas, but
                        might do so if it wished.</p>
                    <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0283"/>
                    <p>3. The export of unpublished technical information should be controlled in a
                        manner consistent with export controls over commodities. Thus, if a
                        commodity is permitted to be exported to the Soviet Bloc, the export of the
                        technical information with respect to such commodity should also be
                        permitted to be exported.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">(2) Import Restrictions</p>
                    <p>The Administration should seek an amendment of the Trade Agreements Extension
                        Act of 1951 which would authorize the President to restore <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment to Soviet Bloc countries and to
                        permit the importation of certain furs from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, if the President determines it to be in the national
                        interest to do so.</p>
                    <p>The Departments of State and Treasury should undertake joint consultation
                        with a view to developing a more realistic and effective method of applying
                        the Antidumping Law in the case of imports from Soviet Bloc countries. It is
                        desirable that a new and more suitable approach be adopted with regard to
                        the administration of the Antidumping Law in the case of imports from Bloc
                        countries lest the administration of the act prevent legitimate imports from
                        Bloc countries and nullify the effect of other recommendations in this
                        paper.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">(3) Surplus Agricultural Disposal</p>
                    <p>The Administration should seek modification of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480<note n="2" xml:id="d98fn2">For text of the Agricultural
                            Trade Development and Assistance Act, July 10, 1954, see 68 Stat.
                            454.</note> to provide discretionary authority for the President to
                        waive the “friendly nation” requirement of the Act, with respect to the
                        dominated countries of Eastern Europe, when the President considers such
                        action to be in the national interest. Amendment of the Act should also be
                        sought to permit barter of subsidized agricultural commodities to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">(4) Stockpile Surpluses</p>
                    <p>The US Government should inform the Soviet Bloc countries, at appropriate
                        occasions, that the United States is prepared to consider bids for stockpile
                        surpluses subject to existing controls on certain strategic materials and
                        continued embargo on goods to the Communist countries of Asia.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">(5) Underdeveloped Countries</p>
                    <p>The Administration should seek legislation which would authorize the
                        President to reduce US tariffs or other import restrictions in order to
                        provide alternative opportunities for exports of a Free World country under
                        Communist economic pressure.</p>
                    <p>Implementation of the recommendations for increasing trade with the Soviet
                        Bloc should give careful consideration to the effect on the less-developed
                        countries, including those whose products might be affected, <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0284"/>as well as those who have stood by us in
                        the period of stronger controls and who would look askance at the calculated
                        easing of such controls. We should make clear to the less-developed
                        countries that our extension of credits to certain of the dominated
                        countries of the Soviet Bloc is in the common interest and that we intend to
                        maintain the planned general level of assistance to our friends.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">(6) <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>The United States should support a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        study of economic relations with the Soviet Bloc and the implications
                        thereof to the Free World, in order that a coordinated program may be
                        developed to protect the interests of the Free World. Special problems posed
                        by Soviet Bloc purchase and sales policies in individual commodities should
                        also be examined, and the US should develop specific policies and programs
                        to guide US participation in those studies (e.g., the current oil
                        study).</p>
                    <p>The United States should seek to extend the concept of contingency planning
                        with our allies to the use of economic levers in conjunction with our
                        diplomatic and other actions in the event of a crisis such as may occur in
                        Berlin and Iran. Initial bilateral consultations with our key allies would
                        prepare for introduction of the subject into <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. A formula should be developed to bring Japan into these
                        considerations. The United States should also explore in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> the principle of coordinated action to
                        provide alternative markets to a country subjected to severe Bloc pressure
                        as a result of a sharp reduction in Bloc purchases.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">(7) Trade Practices</p>
                    <p>From time to time the suggestion has been made that it would be desirable to
                        develop general “ground rules” for the conduct of trade and other economic
                        relations between the Soviet Bloc and the Free World.</p>
                    <p>There are serious problems which Free World countries face in dealing with
                        the Bloc which might be lessened if certain ground rules could be developed.
                        Some of these problems relate to such matters as disruptive pricing
                        practices, resale of primary commodities, inadequate arbitration, patent and
                        copyright procedures, and lack of reasonable access by businessmen.</p>
                    <p>At the present time the United States Government is seeking to develop a set
                        of ground rules which would provide an effective and realistic basis for
                        governing trade relations between the Soviet Bloc and Free World countries,
                        but has not yet developed such rules. A study of the problem is now
                        underway. When the United States has developed a sufficiently significant
                        number of such rules, it should discuss them bilaterally with certain key
                        countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. If
                        such preliminary soundings warrant proceeding further, they should be
                        discussed in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Pending the possible
                        adoption of such ground rules, an effort should be made to obtain in such
                        individual understandings or agreements on particular <pb n="257" xml:id="pg_257" facs="0285"/>economic problems as may be concluded with
                        the Soviet Bloc such general safeguards or rules as it is possible to devise
                        to ensure fair treatment.</p>
                    <p>(b) Finance. One of the main concerns of the Soviet Union is its desire for
                        credits to finance its rapid power build-up through technically-advanced
                        imports from the West. At the present time, it receives some European
                        credits repayable over a period of up to five years, and is pressing for an
                        extension of the repayment period on future credits. While the US Government
                        should have flexibility in determining the use of credits for the dominated
                        countries of the Soviet Bloc, at the present time it is not appropriate to
                        consider the extension of government credits to the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The Administration should seek amendment of the <persName>Johnson</persName>
                            Act<note n="3" xml:id="d98fn3">For text of the

                            amended on July 31, 1945, see 59 Stat. 516.</note> so as to authorize
                        the President to waive restrictions of the Act on private credits when he
                        finds such action to be in the national interest.</p>
                    <p>We should continue to press for an independent lend-lease settlement. The
                        lack of such a settlement should not necessarily preclude possible United
                        States action on <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>, furs, credits, etc.,
                        which would promote the expansion of peaceful trade. Action which might be
                        taken on any of these matters should be considered in the light of
                        advantages we might gain in other fields and in the light of other factors
                        affecting US relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The extension of public credits or government guarantees on private credits
                        to the dominated countries of Eastern Europe should be considered on their
                        merit on an individual, case by case, basis in the light of US policy toward
                        the country concerned. While public credits to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be proscribed, the extension of export-import
                        guarantees of normal, short, and medium-term credits to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should be permissible on a case by case
                        basis when it is clear that the assistance involved is to American firms
                        seeking to do business with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                        does not constitute assistance to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        as defined under the Battle Act.</p>
                    <p>The United States should continue, bilaterally and in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, its efforts to persuade our allies,
                        including Japan, of the need to limit medium and long-term credits to the
                        Soviet Bloc, and to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in particular,
                        bearing in mind the limited total availabilities of Free World development
                        credits for the less-developed countries.</p>
                    <p>(c) International Economic Forums. International economic forums constitute
                        an area where the Bloc has been increasingly active, presumably for
                        politico-psychological reasons. Despite their efforts, the Bloc has not
                        achieved any significant results. We should make clear our willingness to
                        meet Bloc demands for selected and appropriate representation, <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0286"/>when they provide qualified personnel, but
                        resist Bloc pressures for additional key positions or replacement of Western
                        nationals under vicious personal attack from the Soviet Bloc. While we
                        should plan positive initiatives to the extent possible, we should not
                        attempt to counter every Bloc move nor, conversely, fear to take a strongly
                        negative line in opposing Soviet initiatives. The budget for US
                        participation in international forums should be increased to permit more
                        adequate US delegations. The US should actively seek recruitable US and
                        other friendly officials to fill secretariat positions, even to the extent,
                        when necessary, of providing added inducements to attract key personnel.</p>
                    <p>(d) Civil Aviation. Civil aviation is a major economic element in the
                        day-to-day conflict of systems. Bloc civil air activities assign high
                        priority to the supply of craft, development of airlines, and related
                        facilities as a part of its program of economic penetration and erosion of
                        US and Western strength.</p>
                    <p>The United States should continue to seek an air transport agreement with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on the basis of reciprocal rights
                        with appropriate safeguards and emphasis on international standards and
                        principles. The United States should continue to encourage our allies
                        throughout the world to follow the same pattern in insistence upon
                        reciprocity and adherence to international standards.</p>
                    <p>The United States should also promote assistance to, and participation in,
                        national civil air enterprises in less-developed countries by American
                        enterprises and, where appropriate, to assist in the development of regional
                        airlines.</p>
                    <p>(e) Aid Projects to Less-Developed Countries. The United States should, in
                        developing its own aid program, take into account Soviet aid programs and
                        their competitive objectives. In some cases it may be advisable to give aid
                        in order to compete with Bloc activities. As a general rule US programs
                        should give maximum weight to sound economic development as a guiding
                        principle. However, the political objectives which are a part of broad US
                        objectives should be weighed into the balance especially when through its
                        aid program the United States can prevent the Soviets from achieving a
                        dominant position in a recipient country; or when the success of US efforts
                        can be jeopardized by Soviet influence in key sectors or with key people in
                        a recipient country.</p>
                    <p>Under present circumstances, the United States should not in general propose
                        joint sponsorship of aid projects with the Bloc. US aid which may relate to
                        Bloc projects should be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                    <p>(f) International Commodity Problems. The US should in general favor
                        participation by Bloc countries in international study groups and
                        agreements. However, each situation should be considered on its merits and
                        less formal association on the pattern of the Soviet understanding with the
                        International Tin Council, should also be considered.</p>

                    <p>3. Implementation and timing of recommendations.</p>
                    <p>Consultation should be undertaken in the near future with key <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries in order to obtain greater
                        harmony of policy on economic relations between the Free World and the
                        Bloc.</p>
                    <p>At the appropriate time, the Executive Branch should begin consultation with
                        the Congress to obtain support for greater flexibility. The foundation
                        should be laid for early request for Congressional action on the key
                        legislative recommendations mentioned in this paper. The manner of
                        presentation of legislative changes should be determined after consultation
                        with Congressional leaders.</p>
                    <p>Without requiring Congressional approval, certain actions might be taken,
                        should it be determined that they would contribute to our political
                        objectives in respect of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the
                        dominated countries of Eastern Europe, taking into account the special
                        circumstances of the individual countries to which the actions could apply.
                        Among such possible actions are the development of more flexible procedures
                        with regard to certain Foreign Assets control regulations, and announcement
                        of US readiness to accept bids from the Soviet Bloc for stockpile
                        purchases.</p>

                    <p>1. This year a Berlin crisis will create heightened tensions and possibly
                        some violence in the heart of Europe. At the height of this crisis, the <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0288"/>US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will each be seeking to judge the likelihood of a
                        pre-emptive strike by the opposing side. If either country judges that a
                        strike by the other has become a probability, it may well hit first.</p>
                    <p>2. It is in the US interest to minimize the risk of such a miscalculation.
                        This purpose might be served by certain consensual arrangements, which might
                        be taken beforehand by the Soviets and ourselves. Secure facilities for
                        direct telephone communication between the heads of the US and Soviet
                        governments would be one such measure. This was proposed to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> by a panel which he assembled under
                        Professor Schelling <note n="2" xml:id="d99fn2"> Thomas C. Schelling,
                            Professor at Harvard University and member of the U.S. Air Force
                            Scientific Advisory Board.</note> to study the problem of war by
                        miscalculation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> proposed
                        it to the Secretary, who approved it and suggested to the President that he
                        raise the matter at Vienna. I am told the President's failure to do so was
                        due to nothing more than the press of other matters—although you would know
                        more about this than I.</p>
                    <p>3. I would think it useful to press ahead urgently with this direct telephone
                        facility. If and when violence short of general war occurs over Berlin, the
                        ability of the US and Soviet heads of government to communicate rapidly,
                        surely, and directly may be essential to maintenance of peace.</p>
                    <p>4. I wonder if it would not be useful for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> to put this proposal directly to
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, while we are staffing
                        out in the Department the technical steps that would be necessary to install
                        a direct telephone line between the Department and the Embassy which could
                        be used for conversation between the two heads of government.</p>
                    <p>If <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> approved the proposal,
                        as his past statements suggest that he would, then some US experts could be
                        despatched to Moscow who have studied the problem of war by miscalculation,
                        such as those who have served on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>'s panel. These experts could discuss with the Soviets
                        measures that would be needed to make the phone of optimum usefulness.</p>
                    <p>5. Not the last advantage of raising this matter with the Soviets now would
                        be in indicating to them our expectation that there will be grave risk of a
                        Berlin crisis escalating into general nuclear war, if they precipitate such
                        a crisis. This might give the Kremlin food for thought.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary opened the meeting by saying that he wanted to give <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> his impressions of the Vienna talks. He said
                        that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> tried to impress
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> with the idea that “communism was here to
                        stay” and that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was “on the right
                        side of history.” The Secretary added that in this respect <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> echoed views expressed in his
                        January 6 speech. He mentioned that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had emphasized the vitality of the Soviet system
                        and that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was engaged in a sacred
                        war to “rid backward nations of capitalistic oppression”; the US had on the
                        other hand accepted the mantle of the status quo and our collapse was
                        historically inevitable. The Secretary remarked that he had told Khrushchev
                        that he would make an excellent sales manager for General Motors.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he was particularly impressed with the targets that
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> evinced—“those
                        countries in which the Soviets find the greatest opportunities are the same
                        ones with which we are having the greatest difficulties.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we must reexamine the situation as it existed in the
                        '40s to know how to deal with the present problems. The Secretary mentioned
                        in this context that almost every vote in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> during the latter part of the '40s was overwhelmingly
                        against the Soviet bloc. Using the Troika doctrine as a “casus belli” we
                        must find ways and means of associating ourselves with the neutrals as well
                        as our allies in order to again consolidate the world against the communist
                        bloc; this should be our aim in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> this
                        fall. He said that the January 6 speech gave us ample ammunition to indicate
                        to the world that the bloc had declared war on us and practically everyone
                        else.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> said that we must make
                        issue of Soviet interference in the internal political life of various
                        countries—witness Suslov's trip to India during the Indian Communist Party
                        Congress—in order to put Soviet <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0290"/>intentions in the proper light. The Secretary replied that this would be
                        difficult because “our hands are not too clean”.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the US need not become too involved in various
                        regions of the world lest our strength become dispersed; that we should push
                        others to the front. In this context he expressed the feeling that by
                        sponsoring such regional organizations as <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> we had
                        promoted a sharp division among members of these pacts and nonmembers in the
                        respective geographic areas. He said that we must find ways to improve
                        relations among these powers. He agreed that the Commonwealth was a proven
                        device for bringing together disparate elements in a more or less happy
                        union and that we should attempt to strengthen such associations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> mentioned that <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> was contemplating a study on the
                        Commonwealth and that he personally felt that Burma would join the
                        Commonwealth if asked.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we should try to aid group arrangements showing any
                        evidence of strength in the Near East and Asia. He cited the All-Asia
                        consultative committee as one association worth considering in this
                        respect.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> asked the Secretary to
                        what extent <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would risk
                        war. He added that it seemed <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had outdone Mr. Dulles <note n="2" xml:id="d100fn2"> John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State until April
                            1959.</note> in a policy of brinkmanship.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        was interested in establishing a status quo in Europe and that he was
                        currently worried about the rise of neo-nationalism in the bloc European
                        states. He said that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did
                        not consider Berlin a problem per se but that he would like to use it as a
                        means of further reducing US prestige. He said that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> seemed to be convinced that
                        there would not be a nuclear war and he was of course right in believing
                        that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> military position on the
                        ground was in his favor. The Secretary added that Cuba and Laos were not
                        serious factors in the present Soviet strategy. In reply to a question from
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ORI1">Owen</persName>, the Secretary stated that
                        the President's statements on our position regarding Berlin and Germany had
                        had no profound effect on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked who performed policy planning in the Kremlin? Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> answered that he had
                        asked <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> the same question and
                        that he was given no specific information on the subject other than there
                        were planners at every level of Soviet government.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary remarked that it was obvious that the Soviets had made some
                        fairly fundamental and far-reaching decisions in the last several years and
                        that they were not going to subject any of their vital interests to a third
                        party, e.g., disarmament, the Congo.</p>
                    <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0291"/>
                    <p>The Secretary concluded that we must have a policy on Berlin that would force
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to realize that
                        continuing on his present course would mean sacrificing his position among
                        the uncommitted nations. (As an aside, the Secretary said that he was
                        impressed that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was willing
                        to make the sacrifice.) He said that the only way we could affect a world
                        community position against the bloc would be to assay what mistakes we had
                        made and what mistakes the Russians had made; this should be a principal
                        task of <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>.</p>

                        June 26, 1961, <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>
                        discussed closing out the bilateral talks which had begun in Washington June
                        19 between <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">John McCloy</persName> and Soviet
                        Deputy Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Valerian
                            Zorin</persName> in an effort to reach agreement on an appropriate forum
                        for multinational general disarmament negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> noted that both <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Adlai Stevenson</persName>, U.S. Representative to the
                        United Nations, and <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> believed
                        that the Soviets “no longer feel—if they ever did—that anything serious can
                        be accomplished.” <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> met for the last time on
                        June 30 and agreed to reconvene in mid-July. During a meeting with President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> on June 30, <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> raised the issue of merging the test
                        ban talks with those on general disarmament should the test talks fail.
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> reaffirmed his
                        opposition to such a move. <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> met in Moscow seven times

                    <p>On Monday morning at 10:15 a.m., June 26, 1961, the President met with
                        Aleksey Adzhubey, Editor of Izvestia; <persName corresp="#p_KMA1">Mikhail
                            Kharlamov</persName>, Chief of the Press Division of the Soviet Foreign
                        Office; and <persName corresp="#p_BGN1">Georgi Bolshikov</persName>, Editor
                        of <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and former Washington correspondent
                        of the <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> News Agency who acted as
                        interpreter.</p>
                    <p>The President began the discussion by asking Mr. Adzhubey if he had made any
                        progress in his conversation with me relative to improving communications on
                        the journalist level. Mr. Adzhubey replied that we had made progress and
                        that he was looking forward to receiving a memorandum from me on the
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>The President then said he had read with interest Premier <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s speech in the Soviet Union
                            yesterday<note n="2" xml:id="d102fn2">For text of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s speech on June 25, see <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>, June 26, 1961.</note> in which the Soviet
                        Premier had described the United States as a “worn out runner” and predicted
                        the Soviet Union would surpass us economically in 1970.</p>
                    <p>The President cited a number of figures to the Soviets showing that their
                        economic growth estimates were impossible—that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could not pass us by 1970-1978. These figures showed that
                        in 1913 when Russia was under the czars, their Gross National Product
                            (<gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>) was 43% of the United States. In
                        1959 it was 47%. He said by the best possible estimates of Soviet growth and
                        the lowest possible estimates of United States growth, the Soviet Union's
                            <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> would be only 62% by 1978. He said
                        this in itself would be a remarkable advance for the Soviet people and would
                        bring them to a standard of living comparable to that of the United States
                        in 1960. The President said that this was the area of competition that we
                        should engage in. He said that the Soviet Union should not force us into a
                        war. The President said that we should all be around in 1978 to see whether
                        or not Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s estimates
                        were true.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Adzhubey interrupted to say that the Soviet Union figured on increasing
                        from 11% to 11-1/2% while the President computed it at 6%. The President
                        said that the Russians were entitled to their figures as we were also
                        entitled to ours and that we would guarantee a world at peace to allow us to
                        find out who is right. The President said it was like the story of a
                        high-jumper: progressing from one foot to six feet could be done very easily
                        but from six feet up the progress can be only measured in inches.</p>
                    <p>The President said he could not understand why the Soviet Premier wanted to
                        force the United States out of Berlin. He said that West Berlin <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0293"/>was a symbol for Americans and that if we
                        gave up our rights in Berlin he would be impeached by the American people.
                        Mr. Adzhubey replied by saying that he did not believe that he would be
                        impeached. Adzhubey continued by saying that the Soviet Union merely wanted
                        to make a treaty with East Berlin; they did not want to force the United
                        States out of West Berlin but wanted the right to have Russian troops in
                        West Berlin. The President pointed out that the subject of a treaty with
                        East Germany was not the issue. He said that he had read Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s statements recently where Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> was threatening to shut
                        off access to East Berlin; threatened to close Templehof Airport and that
                        the United States could not and would not stand for this. The President said
                        the United States and the Soviet Union were the two most powerful nations in
                        the world. Why should they fight and leave everything to the rest of the
                        world—including the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>In relation to the subject of Soviet troops in West Berlin the President said
                        he had not yet heard any proposal for allowing American troops in East
                        Berlin. The President said that when the war came to a close perhaps the
                        lines could have been drawn so that matters would be different now. But the
                        lines were drawn as they were and the United States has long-standing
                        commitments to West Berlin and it cannot go back on these commitments. Mr.
                        Adzhubey said that he could not understand all the concern in the United
                        States over West Berlin; the Soviet Union had proposed that Berlin become a
                        free city; that French, American, British, Soviet, Swedish and Indian troops
                        be allowed in West Berlin. The President said that reading Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s remarks he did not think that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> grasped the real
                        significance of a “free city”. Under Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s proposal, Berlin would not be a free city. The
                        President said that if the Soviet Union was so desirous of West Berlin being
                        a free city, why didn't the Soviet Union just keep the “status quo” because
                        West Berlin is, in effect, now a free city. Again the President said he
                        heard no proposal by the Soviet Union to allow American troops into East
                        Berlin. He also pointed out that West Berlin had not become a part of the
                        Federal Republic while East Berlin had been incorporated into the East
                        German Democratic Republic.</p>
                    <p>The President said that American forces in West Berlin were token in
                        nature—10,000 men—a symbol of our commitments; that we were going to
                        maintain these commitments.</p>
                    <p>The President reiterated the hope that the United States could live in peace
                        with the Soviet Union and that that had been his hope since taking
                        office.</p>
                    <p>The President pointed out that American troops had not been sent into Laos
                        and Cuba (in the latter case, there was a desire by the American people to
                        do so). Mr. Adzhubey said he understood this; the Soviet Union had not sent
                        troops into Laos either.</p>
                    <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0294"/>
                    <p>Mr. Adzhubey concluded the conversation by saying that perhaps the Soviet
                        Union could also send a token force into West Berlin—17 nurses. The
                        President laughingly said that perhaps it could be worked out.</p>
                    <p>The President then took Mr. Adzhubey, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KMA1">Kharlamov</persName> and Mr. Bolshikov into the Fish Room where he
                        showed them the model boat which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> sent to him. Mr. Adzhubey said that our exchanges
                        should be in boats of this type.</p>

                    <p>In a report transmitted to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> on June 28, 1961, Special Consultant Dean Acheson
                        contended that the issue over Berlin was far more than an issue over that
                        city. “It has become an issue of resolution between the U.S.A. and the
                        U.S.S.R., the outcome of which will go far to determine the confidence of
                        Europe—indeed, of the whole world—in the United States.” Until the Russians
                        were shown that what they want to do was not possible, Acheson stated, “no
                        negotiation can accomplish more than to cover with face-saving devices
                        submission to Soviet demands.” It was necessary to devise “a course of
                        conduct which will change the present apparent Russian disbelief that the
                        United States would go to nuclear war over Berlin, rather than submit.” For

                    <p>In National Security Action Memorandum No. 58, June 30, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> instructed the Secretaries of
                        State, Defense, and Treasury to submit recommendations for possible
                        military, economic, and other actions against the Soviet Bloc should the
                        latter increase tension over Berlin. For text of the <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss>, see ibid., pages 162-165. Alternative
                        strategies for dealing with Berlin were discussed at a National Security
                        Council meeting on July 13 and at a meeting of the Steering Group that <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0295"/>followed. Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> favored proceeding with all measures not requiring
                        the declaration of a national emergency. For text of the memorandum of

                    <p>The Steering Group again discussed Berlin at a meeting just prior to the
                        National Security Council meeting on July 19. According to the minutes,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> “indicated his support
                        for a military program with three characteristics: 1. A present build-up; 2.
                        A capability to stop <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> troops by the end
                        of 1961; 3. An ability to fight conventional war for several weeks against
                        Soviet forces, at the same point in time.” In National Security Action
                        Memorandum No. 62, July 24, <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> authorized a
                        “prompt strengthening of the United States military position, including
                        giving the U.S. “the capability of deploying as many as six additional
                        divisions and supporting air units to Europe at any time after January 1,
                        1962, that the international situation many warrant it.” For text of the

                    <p>In a speech to the nation the evening of July 25, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> stated that the United States
                        “cannot and will not permit the Communists to drive us out of Berlin.” He
                        outlined six steps the United States would take in the military field “to
                        meet this threat to peace.” For text of the speech, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">John F. Kennedy</persName>, 1961</hi>, pages

                        Embassy reported that in a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">John
                            McCloy</persName> the previous day Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> stated that the “President in effect had declared
                        preliminary war on <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s because he had
                        presented Sovs with ultimatum and had said if ultimatum not accepted that
                        would mean war. <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s regretted President
                        took this course, but accepted challenge and would not change policy
                        directed at signing peace treaty.” For text of telegram 323, see <ref target="frus1961-63v14">

                    <p>A report prepared by an Ad Hoc Committee of the United States Intelligence
                        Board and approved by the <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss> on July 11,
                        1961, assessed the extent of Sino-Soviet Bloc military collaboration with
                        the Castro regime in Cuba. The report concluded that the Soviet Bloc was
                        extending “considerable military assistance to Cuba in the form of military
                        equipment, <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0296"/>training, and
                        technicians and advisers.” Soviet Bloc military equipment, together with
                        purchases from Western sources, had contributed substantially to a major
                        military buildup, strengthening Castro's dictatorship and giving him ground
                        forces that were “probably now better equipped than those of any Latin
                        American country.” His regime provided “a better base of operations for
                        subversion and propaganda throughout Latin America than the Soviets have
                        ever had.” For text of the report, see <ref target="frus1961-63v10">

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName> presented the questions of
                        (1) any desirable change in policy on export of research equipment to the
                        Soviet bloc and (2) the specific case of a Van de Graaff accelerator for
                        Poland.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated the U.S. position as
                        one of openness and cooperation in basic science. Science is inherently
                        international in character. Many of the true scientists in bloc countries
                        are not political and to this extent they offer a constructive contact. The
                        Rockefeller Foundation Science Project with Polish scientists exemplifies a
                        healthy enterprise.</p>
                    <p>We should not change policy at this time just because of a potential Berlin
                        crisis. If the crisis should require certain restrictive actions in the
                        future, they would be made by policy decision at the time.</p>
                    <p>Policy might dictate some selectivity between different countries of the bloc
                        group, e.g. Poland over the U.S.S.R. and Rumania over Bulgaria. <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0297"/>He suggested that <persName corresp="#p_WWG1">Whitman</persName> might help the Export Control
                        people if such an issue arises. He added that the Government should not urge
                        a manufacturer to sell equipment to a bloc country against his wishes. He
                        ended with the observation that attempts to restrict pure science might
                        resemble the tale of King Canute and the Tide. He then left the meeting but
                        returned later.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that, while pure
                        research of course may have an effect on military capability, the Department
                        of Defense should object to export only if the proposed shipment added a
                        substantial increment of military power. Otherwise, political considerations
                        were the dominant factors and the State Department should therefore be the
                        judge. He believed that the Department of Defense has in the past been much
                        too restrictive about exports of scientific equipment.</p>
                    <p>He recommended that a 30-day time limit be established for giving a Yes or No
                        answer after a request for an export license has been received, pointing out
                        the disadvantage of long-delayed decisions when the real issues are
                        political.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName> commented that the working
                        group in Commerce should not make decisions between different bloc countries
                        on their own judgment and that they should expect guidance from State on
                        such policy matters. He anticipated that a decision to ship the accelerator
                        to Poland would bring criticism but he was quite willing to take it if he
                        were assured of support. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> volunteered support.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName> then announced that (1)
                        shipment of the accelerator will be approved, (2) he is satisfied that basic
                        policy should not be changed at this time and (3) the 30-day time limit
                        proposed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> is to be
                        adopted.</p>

                        begin discussion of the agreement at Washington on July 18. James M. Landis,
                        Special Assistant to the President, <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0298"/>chaired the U.S. delegation, while Colonel General Yevgeni E. Loginov,
                        Chief of the Main Administration of the Soviet Air Fleet, led the Soviet
                        delegation. A copy of Landis' instructions for the negotiations is in

                    <p>The delegations met 11 times before reaching an agreement on a draft text on

                        8-461 and 911.7261/7-861 through 8-361. Two days later in requesting
                        authority to sign the agreement, the Bureau of Economic Affairs, Department
                        of State, pointed out that the U.S. objectives in the negotiations had been
                        achieved, including agreement to direct reciprocal flights between New York
                        and Moscow, a commitment by the Soviet Union to adhere to applicable
                        International Civil Aviation Organization standards, provisions for the
                        inspection of each side's aircraft, and Soviet agreement not to land at

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName> welcomed Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_RSK1">Romanovsky</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KVM1">Kamenev</persName> to this country and to the discussions on
                        American-Soviet exchanges, and expressed the hope that the promising
                        cultural ties between our countries would continue to develop.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RSK1">Romanovsky</persName> thanked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName> for the opportunity to visit with
                        him and to discuss the exchange program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RSK1">Romanovsky</persName> then made the following statement:</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union believed in the widest possible contacts through cultural,
                        educational and scientific-technical exchanges. The present exchanges
                        agreement and the previous one have proved that both countries gain from
                        this contact. Enough time has passed to judge the value of the U.S.-U.S.S.R.
                        Exchanges Agreement of November 21, 1959:<note n="2" xml:id="d108fn2">For
                            text of this agreement, see 10 UST, p. 1934.</note> in the Soviet view,
                        it has been fulfilled satisfactorily. In some sections of the Agreement,
                        however, there has been unsatisfactory implementation owing to the attitude
                        of the American side: for example, in exchanges of scientists, films, and of
                        representatives of social organizations. The Soviet side wishes to remove
                        these obstacles, and wished to discuss concrete ways of so doing.</p>
                    <p>As you know, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RSK1">Romanovsky</persName> continued,
                        the Soviet Union stands for further development of exchanges, and proposes
                        negotiations for a new exchanges agreement to cover 1962-1963; we know from
                        your statements <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0300"/>that you agree.
                        Taking into consideration the established scientific, technical and cultural
                        relations between our countries, the Soviet side believes we should put
                        these relations on a firmer legal basis. The Soviet side would like to sign
                        a Cultural Convention on the principles of scientific, technical and
                        cultural exchanges. However, knowing American difficulties in signing such a
                        convention, the Soviet side proposes an exchange of letters between the
                        Minister of Foreign Affairs of the U.S.S.R. and the Secretary of State
                        concerning the principles of exchanges.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RSK1">Romanovsky</persName> then read the text of
                        the Soviet draft letter, and presented copies. (A translation is appended.)
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RSK1">Romanovsky</persName> concluded that the
                        Soviet side was interested in hearing concrete proposals for the 1962-1963
                        agreement, and observed that the Soviet proposals aimed at a further
                        strengthening of ties between the countries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName> said that he wished to
                        welcome Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_RSK1">Romanovsky</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_KVM1">Kamenev</persName> again, and that he was
                        sure their presence meant a genuine interest in expanding exchanges. He
                        pointed out that although he was new in his present position, having been in
                        the field of education before, he was greatly interested in furthering
                        international exchanges, and was especially interested in American-Soviet
                        exchanges. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName> said this
                        Administration had already shown the great interest it had in educational
                        and cultural exchanges. In fact, he added, the existence of an Assistant
                        Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs demonstrated the importance
                        we attached to this field. For his own part, he said, when he looked at the
                        brief period American- Soviet exchanges had been carried on, he was
                        impressed not with the difficulties but with the progress made in such a
                        short time.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName> then made the following
                        statement:</p>
                    <p>Our countries have two fundamental areas of agreement with regard to
                        exchanges: first, we have both found our experience to date in exchanges
                        desirable and beneficial; second, we both want to move on, to enlarge and
                        improve exchanges. Both sides could cite impediments, but there is little to
                        gain from charges and counter-charges in these discussions. The United
                        States side was heartened by the action of the Soviet Government in
                        improving access of American exchange students and professors to
                        laboratories and archives in the U.S.S.R., and in enabling them to travel
                        more freely. We were especially pleased at this, because the absence of
                        these facilities make it difficult for our ablest students to go to the
                        U.S.S.R. for a year instead of continuing their studies at home. We hope
                        this action augurs well for future exchanges. We agree that if we can use
                        your visit to discuss specific points for improvement, then further
                        negotiations for a new concrete exchange arrangement can proceed more
                        easily.</p>
                    <p>For our part, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName> continued, we
                        have numerous specific points in mind, of which a few might be cited as
                        examples:</p>
                    <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0301"/>
                    <p>1. In the academic field, we hope for an increase in the exchange of able
                        graduate students, and hope also for the exchange of professors for a
                        sufficient period of time to make their visits useful. The key to this
                        exchange is creating conditions in each country that will make it possible
                        for the best students and professors to devote this time to study in the
                        other country. For our students and professors, going to the U.S.S.R. is
                        entirely voluntary, and they have many alternatives; they must see Soviet
                        study as the best alternative or we cannot persuade them to go. We hope also
                        that this exchange will be well balanced, with participation from students
                        in all major fields—from scientific to humanistic—across the full academic
                        spectrum.</p>
                    <p>2. Another step forward in the academic realm would be in the field of
                        language study. Russian study has been limited in the United States, and we
                        welcome the opportunity to send language students to the U.S.S.R., to have
                        Soviet teachers here, and to contribute also to Soviet study of English.</p>
                    <p>3. Another mutually beneficial exchange would be in the field of educational
                        administration: how to organize and conduct an educational system. We all
                        have problems of expanding and improving our school systems, and can
                        certainly learn from each other.</p>
                    <p>4. We are very much interested in bringing our peoples into closer contact
                        through books, magazines, radio-television, and so forth. Only through this
                        wider informational contact can we move more rapidly toward better
                        understanding and elimination of misconceptions. We feel that at present
                        American citizens who want to learn about the U.S.S.R. have more opportunity
                        than your citizens who want to learn about us. For example, Soviet books are
                        sold freely in American bookstores, but Soviet citizens do not have access
                        to American publications. If we are serious about expanding mutual
                        understanding, we will expand the exchange of books, magazines, radio and
                        television programs. We must face honestly the fact that you do not want to
                        receive American propaganda material, nor are we well disposed toward
                        receiving Soviet propaganda. But there is a wide area beyond propaganda—for
                        example, music, art, culture—and we should expand first in this area, where
                        expansion is easiest.</p>
                    <p>5. Of particular interest to me is the exchange of educational radio and
                        television materials. America has experimented a great deal in this field,
                        and an exchange would enrich both educational systems.</p>
                    <p>6. Cultural presentations has been an especially gratifying field: both
                        peoples have welcomed the other's performing artists. These exchanges should
                        not only be expanded but made more valuable by sending artists to a larger
                        number of cities—small as well as large—so that wider contact could be
                        established. It would also be well to emphasize younger performers—talented
                        university students, for example—for if <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0302"/>we put our young people into communication we shall do more
                        than anything else could to improve understanding. We were gratified that
                        the Michigan University Symphonic Band did so well in the U.S.S.R., and
                        would welcome similar Soviet groups, small or large, at our cities and
                        universities.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName> concluded by saying that
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFG1">Siscoe</persName> would be responsible for
                        conducting the detailed discussions. He said that in his view conditions
                        were favorable for making progress in exchanges. Our two countries have been
                        in this activity a short time together, he added, but we are now ready to
                        graduate from elementary to high school. If we put ourselves in the mood of
                        trying to solve problems, rather than in the mood of a chess game, we can
                        solve our problems.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RSK1">Romanovsky</persName> commented that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SFG1">Siscoe</persName> was already a professor in
                        this field, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFG1">Siscoe</persName> replied
                        that all he knew about chess he learned from Russian masters.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RSK1">Romanovsky</persName> said he wished to
                        emphasize the interest of the Soviet Government in the widest possible
                        contacts, and said the existence of the State Committee for Cultural
                        Relations with Foreign Countries showed this interest. As for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName>' comments, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RSK1">Romanovsky</persName> said he wished to say a few
                        words. In regard to the exchange of students and professors, he said the
                        Soviet side favored an increase, and regretted that instead of fifty the
                        U.S. side had agreed to only thirty-eight students this year. As for
                        language study, the Soviet side also favored this, and as a first step would
                        recommend implementing the provision for exchanges in this field already in
                        the Exchanges Agreement. The idea of exchanging specialists in school
                        administration, he said, was very interesting. As for publications and
                        radio-television, the Soviet side was in favor of increasing exchanges. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RSK1">Romanovsky</persName> said he wished to
                        point out that Soviet citizens have more opportunity to know American
                        literature and books than vice-versa, for the U.S.S.R. publishes many more
                        American books in translation than the United States does Soviet books. The
                        Soviet Union was for an increase in this field of exchanges. In particular,
                        he added, it favored an increase in circulation of <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Amerika. He said he agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName>' statement about propaganda. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RSK1">Romanovsky</persName> said the Soviet side
                        was also happy about developments in the performing arts field, and he would
                        discuss this in more detail with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFG1">Siscoe</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RSK1">Romanovsky</persName> thanked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName> for this exchange of opinions, which
                        he said provided a very favorable basis for the detailed discussions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFG1">Siscoe</persName> then outlined the schedule
                        for discussions: Thursday afternoon, performing arts, education, cinema,
                        tourism; Friday morning, scientific-technical and industrial exchanges;
                        Friday afternoon, information exchanges, and a meeting in the late afternoon
                        with <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> Acting Director <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0303"/>Donald Wilson; Monday morning, general

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName> said he would like to be at
                        the meetings, but was preparing to leave the country soon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RSK1">Romanovsky</persName> said if possible they would like
                        another meeting with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName>
                        Monday after conclusion of discussions, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName> said he would try to be available for such a
                            meeting.<note n="3" xml:id="d108fn3">The U.S. and Soviet sides met four

                    </p>
                    <p>DEAR MR. SECRETARY: I have the honor to refer to the negotiations which
                        recently took place between the representatives of our two governments on
                        scientific, technical and cultural exchanges between the Union of Soviet
                        Socialist Republics and the United States of America. As I understand it,
                        the objective of each of our governments is as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. To expand comprehensively the scientific, technical and cultural ties
                        between our two countries in the interests of improving mutual understanding
                        between the Soviet and the American peoples and developing international
                        cooperation.</p>
                    <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0304"/>
                    <p>2. To implement scientific, technical and cultural ties between the two
                        countries in accordance with the Constitution and the applicable laws and
                        regulations which are in force in each country, with necessary observance of
                        the principles of respecting sovereignty, non-interference in internal
                        affairs, and equality.</p>
                    <p>3. To encourage the exchanges of groups of specialists in the field of
                        industry, agriculture, construction, trade, etc.</p>
                    <p>4. To encourage visits by scientists, persons active in higher education and
                        the educational system, and public health for the purpose of conducting
                        joint studies, exchanging experience, holding lectures, and learning about
                        the achievements of both countries; as well as to encourage exchanges of
                        students and graduate students to attend higher educational
                        institutions.</p>
                    <p>5. To encourage visits by scientists and experts to international scientific
                        conferences, congresses, symposia, and exhibits held by both countries, and
                        to extend equal opportunities to all participants of such conferences,
                        congresses, symposia, and exhibits.</p>
                    <p>6. To encourage exchanges of performers and performing troupes, to promote
                        trips of persons active in public and cultural affairs, repre-sentatives of
                        trade-union, women's, youth and other non-governmental organizations.</p>
                    <p>7. To promote the development of ties in the field of sports by organizing
                        trips of athletes and sports organizations; as well as to encourage tourist
                        trips of American citizens to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                        of Soviet citizens to the USA.</p>
                    <p>8. To promote the development of exchange of information between the two
                        countries by organizing exhibits, exchanging radio and television programs
                        and printed publications. I assume that being guided by the aforesaid
                        principles, both countries will regularly develop and sign agreements
                        between our countries on exchanges in the field of science, technology,
                        health, education, and culture, for terms of two years each.</p>
                    <p>I hope, Mr. Secretary, that the aforesaid principles will come into force on
                        receipt of your letter containing approval of these principles by your
                        Government.</p>

                        recorded the President's decision to send <persName corresp="#p_DAH1">Arthur

                        to obtain Soviet agreement to the draft test ban treaty. Should there be no
                        progress within a week, “the President will then announce that in light of
                        Soviet folly he now has concluded that no workable treaty is possible.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> also noted that the
                        “President may, at some appropriate point, reach a decision to authorize
                        stand-by preparations for tests of nuclear weapons, such tests to begin not
                        earlier than 1962.” For text, see ibid., pages 114-115.</p>
                    <p>Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        informed <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> in a letter of July
                        28 that he was recommending that the Committee of Principals propose to the
                        President the initiation of preparations to resume nuclear weapons testing.
                        It now seemed evident, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        stated, “that the Soviet Union is not interested in a treaty to discontinue
                        nuclear weapons tests except on terms unacceptable to the U.S.” <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> proposed a sequence of events
                        starting with “an early announcement that preparations for nuclear tests
                        will start at once, but that the decision to conduct tests will depend on
                        the results of test ban negotiations over the next five or six months,” and
                        culminating in the resumption of tests if treaty negotiations were
                        unsuccessful. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated
                        further that, following six months of underground testing, ten tests “might
                        be made in and above the atmosphere, on the surface of land or water and
                        underwater, but designed to produce a minimum of radioactive contamination.”

                    <p>In response to your inquiry, I can say that the Department continues to
                        support the decision reached by the Export Control Review Board regarding
                        export of wheat or other commodities to the Soviet Bloc. Specifically, we do
                        not advocate any change at this juncture with regard to the export control
                        criteria which permit the licensing of wheat sales to Russia and the Soviet
                        Bloc.</p>
                    <p>I well understand the interest of the Commerce Department in being assured
                        that the prevailing policy does in fact represent the considered position of
                        the Executive Branch. I can also sympathize with them in face of the
                        pressure being applied and inquiries whether such exports are not in
                        conflict with the other actions of the United States Government with respect
                        to Berlin. As you know, a continuance of the present export control policy
                        is consistent with the Presidential determination on Berlin; viz, that we
                        should withhold application of economic warfare measures pending development
                        of the situations that it was agreed should trigger such action.</p>
                    <p>I believe that <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Carl Kaysen</persName> has also
                        brought to your attention the related action we have taken with respect to
                        the amendments proposed by the House for <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480, one of which would have prohibited the export of
                        agricultural surpluses to the Soviet Bloc. Just as we feel the House
                        amendment would be ill-advised, so we would consider any change in the
                        position taken by the Export Control Review Board to be equally
                        ill-advised.</p>

                        called the meeting a “gratifying demonstration of unity and seriousness of
                        purpose.” Although there was some disagreement on tactics, “all four of us
                        agreed that formal negotiations with the Russians should come in October or
                        early November.” The following day, however, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> met with President <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De

                    <p>On August 13, 1961, the German Democratic Republic introduced control
                        measures that effectively prevented residents of the Soviet Zone and East
                        Berlin from entering West Berlin. At the same time barbed wire and other
                        physical barriers, which eventually became “The Berlin Wall,” were erected
                        to restrict crossings into the Western sectors of the city. Secretary of
                        State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> responded on August 13 with
                        a statement calling the restrictions a violation of the Four-Power status of
                        Berlin. For text, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany,
                        1944-1985</hi>, page 776.</p>
                    <p>At its meeting on August 15 the Berlin Steering Group, according to the
                        minutes, “agreed that the closing of the border was not a shooting issue”
                        but instead “was essentially one of propaganda,” providing an opportunity to
                        “reap a large harvest.” At the group's meeting 2 days later, President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> decided that the United
                        States would reinforce the West Berlin garrison with one battle group
                        (1,500-1,800 men). Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> suggested that the border closing “might portend a

                    <p>In an August 18 letter to Governing Mayor Willy Brandt, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> stated that “there are, as you say,
                        no steps available to us which can force a significant material change in
                        this present situation. Since it represents a resounding confession of
                        failure and of political weakness, this brutal border closing evidently
                        represents a basic Soviet decision which only war could reverse.” In an
                        August 21 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, the
                        President indicated that he wanted to “take a stronger lead on Berlin
                        negotiations.” President <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        wrote <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> in a letter of August 26 that he believed
                        “that the opening of negotiations in the present circumstances would be
                        considered immediately as a prelude to the abandonment, at least gradually,
                        of Berlin and as a sort of notice of our surrender.” Nevertheless, in
                        telegram 660 to Moscow, September 3, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> instructed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> to approach Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in anticipation “that there will be
                        discussion with Soviet representatives in regard to future negotiations” on
                        Berlin. “If <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> seems willing to
                        discuss negotiations you might endeavor to ascertain from him what the

                    <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                    <p>To estimate Soviet tactics in the Berlin crisis over the next few months,
                        with particular reference to the effect on these tactics of possible
                        developments within East Germany.</p>
                    <p rend="center">The Estimate</p>
                    <p>1. With the action of 13 August, the Communists have taken a long step toward
                        their objectives in Berlin and have created a new political situation <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0309"/>there. The border controls
                        instituted on that date have met East Germany's most pressing need by
                        reducing the refugee flow to tolerable proportions. At the same time, the
                        division of Berlin into two separate cities has been made virtually
                        complete, with the eastern portion all but incorporated into the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Thus the Soviets, induced by the rising
                        tide of refugees, have taken unilateral action to achieve results which they
                        had intended to accomplish at a later date, and by different means.</p>
                    <p>2. The refugee question, however, was only one aspect of the larger problem
                        of stabilizing the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, and the closing of
                        the Berlin escape route may worsen other aspects if it leads to a further
                        buildup of tensions within East Germany. Even apart from this, the stemming
                        of the refugee flow will not change the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s view of the necessity to bolster the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>'s claims to sovereignty with a peace treaty
                        and eventually to eject Western influence from Berlin altogether. We do not
                        believe that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has given up its
                        intention to press for a peace treaty and a “free city.” The question is
                        whether the Soviet leaders will accelerate their movement towards these
                        objectives, or will moderate their pace after their considerable
                        achievements of 13 August.</p>
                    <p>3. The action in Berlin has initiated a momentum which the Soviets may wish
                        to sustain. A wide variety of further unilateral measures is available to
                        them. The termination of military liaison missions would be a relatively
                        low-keyed act which might appear to the Soviets as a means of keeping events
                        moving in their favor.<note n="2" xml:id="d113fn2">Under the occupation, the
                            US, French, and British forces in West Germany presently have military
                            missions accredited to the Soviet Commander in East Germany, who in turn
                            has missions to the three Allied Commanders. [Footnote in the source
                            text.]</note> Another option would be to deny Allied rights to enter
                        East Berlin, thereby carrying to its conclusion the destruction of the
                        four-power status of that part of the city. More drastically, the East
                        Germans might disrupt or harass civil traffic between West Berlin and the
                        Federal Republic; most dangerous of all, interference with Allied access
                        might begin. Politically, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might
                        choose to accelerate the timing of a peace conference and a separate treaty
                        with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. Another factor which could importantly affect the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s timing and tactics is the increasing involvement of
                        Soviet prestige. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in recent
                        weeks has reacted to the stiffening US attitude by increasing his commitment
                        to early action. He now asserts that the issue transcends the problems of
                        Germany and Berlin, important as these remain, and that the West's refusal
                        to conclude a peace treaty represents an attempt to achieve a “strategic
                        breakthrough” against the Bloc. In claiming a challenge to Soviet power and
                        prestige, he wishes to convey to his opponents that the Soviet Union cannot
                        be expected to draw back from crisis situations in which reason and prudence
                        would appear to dictate <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0310"/>restraint.
                        He might decide to take new steps on Berlin which would strengthen the image
                        of inflexible resolve.</p>
                    <p>5. In our recent estimates of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
                        policy toward Germany and Berlin, we have regularly attributed to the Soviet
                        leaders a confidence that they can move gradually toward their eventual
                        objectives without incurring unacceptable risks. We have pointed to their
                        belief that the West could probably be induced to make negotiated
                        concessions. And we have further estimated that, if these Soviet
                        expectations are not borne out, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        will move unilaterally, but still intending to proceed in such a way as to
                        avoid at any stage unduly high risks of war.<note n="3" xml:id="d113fn3">Our

                    </p>
                    <p>6. We believe that Soviet actions in the recent phase of the Berlin crisis do
                        not indicate that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has departed
                        from this general approach and method. Thus we conclude that the Soviets'
                        present intention probably is not to take further drastic action
                        immediately, though they may undertake measures of limited scope. For
                        example, they will probably further restrict German civil and Allied access
                        to East Berlin, and they may embark upon a program of gradual harassments of
                        German civil traffic to West Berlin. But rather than pose a major challenge
                        to West Berlin itself and the Allied position there, we believe that their
                        present preference is to let the effects of the border closure sink in and
                        see whether the Western Powers have become more inclined to accept Soviet
                        terms of negotiations.</p>
                    <p>7. In the absence of fairly definite proposals by the West, we think it
                        unlikely that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will take
                        the initiative in formally proposing a date and other specifics for
                        East-West negotiations. He clearly wishes to appear as the champion of
                        negotiations, and he may throw out hints, in an effort to encourage a
                        Western proposal, that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could be
                        persuaded to reduce its demands if a conference were arranged. If presented
                        with a Western invitation, he would respond favorably but would undoubtedly
                        attempt to define the task of the conference in a fashion which served
                        Soviet interests. If the negotiations were in train toward the end of the
                        year, he would probably postpone his deadline for a treaty. If negotiations
                        do not materialize, we believe that the next Soviet step will be to issue
                        invitations to their own peace conference, probably accompanied by a revised
                        draft of a treaty applicable to both German states and providing for the
                        declaration of a “free city” status for West Berlin. We think <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0311"/>under these circumstances that the chances
                        are still considerably better than even that the treaty would not be signed
                        before the Party Congress which convenes on 17 October.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Effect of Developments in East Germany</p>
                    <p>8. Soviet tactics will be affected by a large number of factors, including
                        the posture adopted by the West, the movement of opinion in the important
                        uncommitted countries, and domestic developments in East Germany. We have
                        recently examined the possibility that serious unrest might arise in East
                        Germany and have concluded that, under most circumstances, a major eruption
                        is unlikely;<note n="4" xml:id="d113fn4"> SNIE 12-4-61, “Stability of East
                            Germany in a Berlin Crisis,” dated 15 August 1961, Secret. [Footnote in
                            the source text. A copy is ibid.]</note> here we consider how popular
                        disturbances or an uprising might affect Soviet tactics.</p>
                    <p>9. The Soviet leaders evidently are confident of their capability for keeping
                        discontent in check and repressing any outbreaks which might occur. If they
                        came to feel that the chances of a general rising were becoming substantial,
                        their main domestic efforts would probably be in the direction of menace and
                        intimidation. They would alert and deploy their own forces in East Germany,
                        as well as those of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, and the public
                        would be warned of the regime's determination to react with speed and vigor
                        to hostile manifestations. Additionally, they would probably make available
                        additional supplies of consumer goods in order to relieve economic
                        shortages.</p>
                    <p>10. Popular dissatisfaction with internal political and economic conditions
                        would be the basic cause of mass unrest. However, the Communist efforts to
                        consolidate the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as a separate German
                        state by isolating it from further contact with the West, combined with the
                        international tension generated by Communist pressures against West Berlin,
                        are adding to popular unrest. Thus, there is a relationship between the
                        degree of unrest in East Germany and Moscow's pursuit of its policies aimed
                        at neutralizing West Berlin and fixing the division of Germany, particularly
                        since the 13 August action has deprived the East German regime of a safety
                        valve.</p>
                    <p>11. Even so, we see little chance that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, if it believed that an East German rising was likely,
                        would respond by altering its principal aims or policies with respect to
                        Berlin. While it is possible that the Soviets might temporarily modify their
                        tactics or extend their timing to reduce the likelihood of a serious German
                        uprising, we think it unlikely that such a Soviet response would be either
                        very significant or lasting. Moreover, we believe that it would be next to
                        impossible to convince the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, or the East German people that the West
                        intended or had the capability to support widespread anti-regime
                        activities.</p>
                    <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0312"/>
                    <p>12. We believe that the Communists will act speedily and firmly in meeting
                        evidences of public disorder, if these actually develop, in East Germany in
                        the months ahead. If an uprising should occur, they would regard themselves
                        as having no other choice than to put it down, despite the cost to their
                        position and the danger of Western involvement. In the wake of such a
                        repression, the Soviets might accelerate their moves toward a separate peace
                        treaty, believing that it was unprofitable to spend further time in
                        cultivating world opinion or waiting for East-West talks, and that an early

                        and Defense and the Atomic Energy Commission, to “recommend the appropriate

                        Soviets had conducted 24 nuclear tests since August 30, including 4 to 6
                        short-range missile launchings and one test at 100,000 to 200,000 feet.

                    <p>In a September 5, 1961, memorandum to President's Deputy Special Assistant
                        for National Security Affairs <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>,
                        Robert H. Johnson of the National Security Council Staff discussed the
                        possibility that Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        might see “short run advantages” during the Berlin crisis in “stepping up
                        the level of Communist military activity in Southeast Asia.”
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> suggested that the United States “utilize
                        the concern of the neutrals about the Berlin situation to help deter
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>” from taking such
                        action. “We can do this by making explicit ties between the two situations.
                        I believe this might be usefully done in the President's speech to the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.” In a September 15 memorandum to

                        and the “dangerous crisis in Berlin”—“two threats to the peace which are not
                        on your crowded agenda, but which causes us, and most of you, the deepest

                    <p>In telegram 373 to the Department of State from Saigon, September 18,
                        Ambassador Nolting proposed a demarche to the Soviet Government regarding
                        Vietnam in light of a report that on September 12 Georgi Pushkin, Soviet
                        negotiator at the Geneva Conference on Laos, had told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> that (in Nolting's words) the

                        Vietnam’ re Laotian settlement” and had given “faint indication of possible
                        Soviet interest in settling hostilities between two parts Vietnam.” However,
                        in a memorandum for the record, October 5, Assistant Secretary of Defense
                        William Bundy noted that at the Planning Group Luncheon on October 3, “the
                        suggestion that talking direct to the Soviets [on Vietnam] might have some
                        use was pretty unanimously rejected.” For text of both documents, see <ref target="frus1961-63v01">

                    <p>At 7:15 p.m., the Secretary received the Soviet Charge, who had demanded to
                        see the Secretary personally on “urgent business” late this afternoon. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMN1">Smirnovsky</persName>, reading from
                        pencilled notes, said he had come to protest the “bandit raid” this
                        afternoon on the Soviet Embassy and an attempt to set fire to the Embassy.
                        He called this criminal persecution which could have the gravest
                        consequences. He demanded that the criminals be apprehended and punished
                        severely. He also demanded <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0315"/>that all
                        necessary security measures be taken to protect the Embassy. He concluded
                        that he was reporting this affair to Moscow.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary questioned Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMN1">Smirnovsky</persName> at some length and learned the following rather
                        confusing details. According to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMN1">Smirnovsky</persName>, they had discovered the fire in the Ambassador's
                        quarters on the third floor of the Embassy at 4:45 p.m. No one had been seen
                        to enter the Ambassador's quarters, but entry had been made through a window
                        which was broken and he thought that those responsible might have come over
                        the roof from the adjoining Washington Post building. He remarked he had
                        been told some correspondents were taking pictures. The fire had been set in
                        many places, including against the curtains and the Ambassador's bed. It was
                        not a big fire and they had not informed the police or the fire department,
                        but had extinguished the fire through their own means. He did not know if
                        there had been any attempt to steal anything. At one point, he made
                        reference to finding apples half eaten in the Ambassador's apartment.</p>
                    <p>In response to the Secretary's question about when Soviet Embassy personnel
                        had last been in the Ambassador's quarters before the fire was discovered,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMN1">Smirnovsky</persName> merely replied he was
                        not sure, but it could not have been a long time. No one had been seen to
                        enter, but when they found the fire, the room was ablaze.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary expressed regret that this incident had happened and assured
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMN1">Smirnovsky</persName> that our authorities
                        would do everything to apprehend the criminals and to bring them to justice.
                        He asked if our investigative authorities could inspect the scene of the
                        fire in order to try, through fingerprints, etc., to discover those
                        responsible. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMN1">Smirnovsky</persName> agreed
                        that the authorities could investigate at the Embassy provided there was
                        someone present from the State Department.<note n="2" xml:id="d116fn2">On
                            September 13 <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> sent <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> a memorandum on the subject of “The

                            stated that investigation of the fire made clear that it was an inside
                            job for which there was no clear probable motive. (Ibid.,

                        on which he and President Keita had come to the United States and on which
                        others had gone to Moscow was to persuade President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and Premier <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> as soon as possible to meet
                        together. He hoped that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s reply would be “OK”. He believed that Premier
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> himself was ready for
                        a meeting with President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>. He
                        had learned this from Mr. Sulzburger's interview with Premier <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and also from a message he had
                        received from Prime Minister Fanfani of Italy. If asked, the nations which
                        had participated at the Belgrade Conference were also quite willing to give
                        their assistance to bring the two leaders together.</p>
                    <p>President Keita told President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                        that their mission was extremely important given the tension in the world
                        today. The key to peace lay in the hands of the big powers. Hoping that they
                        would use it, the nations represented at Belgrade had asked President
                        Sukarno and him to present this appeal.</p>
                    <p>President Sukarno then presented the appeal addressed to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and signed by the representatives
                        of the states participating at the Belgrade Conference.<note n="2" xml:id="d117fn2">For text of this appeal, which was also presented to
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> by Nehru and
                            Nkrumah, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current

                    </p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> referred to comments
                        that this is a time of transition. That is correct. Societies are changing
                        and this introduces tensions. We in the United States desire change—in a
                        peaceful way. We know quite well that nuclear war would mean widespread
                        destruction at the cost of the lives of a great many people. We are a rich
                        country, as is the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0317"/>Naturally, therefore, we want to solve
                        issues peacefully. The problem is how to do this.</p>
                    <p>Describing his talks with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        in Vienna, when <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had
                        advanced views which to the best of the President's knowledge he had not yet
                        changed, and recent speeches of <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> explained the United States' view of the problems of
                        Germany and Berlin. Our real interest is that the German people should be
                        free to decide what kind of government they want. We do not believe
                            <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> represents the German
                        people, but to ascertain what the people of East and West Germany and East
                        and West Berlin really want, we are willing to have a plebiscite under any
                        impartial international group—the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or any
                        other—and would be glad to accept the verdict so obtained. In other words,
                        we favor self-determination in Germany and in Berlin just as we do in
                        Indonesia, in Africa or anywhere else. We do not want a settlement imposed
                        upon the Germans by us, by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        or by any one.</p>
                    <p>If a plebiscite is not an acceptable proposal then the question is what
                        solution can be reached to permit the people of Berlin to live out their
                        lives peacefully. We are not insisting on rights that happen to have been
                        derived from our participation in the war, but on the rights of the people
                        to live as they wish. We know that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has the power to sign a “peace treaty” with East
                        Germany. What concerns us is that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has held that when the “peace treaty” comes into
                        force our rights in West Berlin would be extinguished and all of West
                        Berlin's external communications would be subject to the control of East
                        Germany.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> told the emissaries
                        of the Belgrade Conference nations that he would be glad to talk with
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> at any time. There
                        would be no use in doing so, however, until we could understand in what
                        direction some agreement could be found. If <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and he were to meet today without this
                        understanding, the results would be disastrous. Therefore it would be best
                        for the Foreign Ministers of the two countries to discuss the various
                        possibilities first.</p>
                    <p>President Sukarno responded that he understood President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> was of the opinion that before
                        meeting <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> he would prefer a
                        meeting of the Foreign Ministers first. If they could discover possibilities
                        of common ground then President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> would be quite willing to see <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. He said he understood further
                        that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s main
                        objection to a meeting now was <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s standpoint on Berlin.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> reiterated that his
                        main objection was not that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had threatened to sign a peace treaty but that in
                        the peace treaty <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would
                        hold that our rights in Berlin had come to an end. Access would be
                        controlled by the East German Government. But we do not believe that the
                        German Democratic Republic represents the people. Therefore, how could we
                        agree to that? Further, we feel—and believe <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0318"/>that the Soviets would agree—that West Berlin wishes to be
                        associated with the West. This means that West Germany must have freedom and
                        you cannot have freedom without communications. We cannot accept any action
                        by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that would strangle
                        Berlin. If we were to agree that we and the Atlantic Community would be
                        finished. We would be pushed out of Europe.</p>
                    <p>President Sukarno recalled his own meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        <note n="3" xml:id="d117fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> visited Indonesia for
                            12 days in February 1960.</note> and said that the latter had told him
                        he was going to sign a peace treaty with East Germany. President Sukarno had
                        understood him to say, however, that access to Berlin would be kept free,
                        but that Berlin would obviously be an enclave in East Germany and
                        communications should therefore be controlled by East Germany.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> described this point
                        in effect as the key. If a regime can control food and supplies and transit,
                        then the people of the city are not free.</p>
                    <p>At the end of World War II we gave up about one third of Eastern Germany that
                        our troops had occupied, but on the basis of the Four Power Agreement that
                        Berlin would be separate until Germany was reunified. If it looks as if
                        reunification won't happen for a while that does not mean that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> can therefore give away our rights in
                        Berlin. The rights are not theirs to give.</p>
                    <p>President Keita observed that their mission to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> was to point out the necessity of
                        some kind of talks to reduce tension. Whether President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would talk personally or have their Foreign
                        Ministers search out the ground was not for the nations represented at
                        Belgrade to say but it would be difficult for the world if there were no
                        talks at all. The non-aligned nations were not trying to say what the nature
                        of the agreement should be. That would depend of course on the
                        discussions.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> informed the two
                        Presidents that the Foreign Ministers of Great Britain, France, Germany and
                        the United States are meeting this week to discuss the problem of Germany
                        and that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> is expected to come
                        next week at which time we hope to see what basis may exist for a peaceful
                        solution. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had told Mr.
                        Sulzburger that he himself did not think a meeting would be useful at
                        present. After talking with Nehru, however, he said he thought a meeting
                        might help.<note n="4" xml:id="d117fn4">In telegram 807 from Moscow,
                            September 7, <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> reported
                            that in his interview with Cyrus Sulzberger <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had initially said the time was not right for
                            a summit meeting. (Department of State, Central Files, 611.61/9-761)
                            Later the same day <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> sent
                            another telegram saying that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wanted the record of the interview to show
                            that he desired a meeting with the President. <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> assumed that the change in
                            position had been due to Nehru's intervention. (Telegram 811 from
                            Moscow; ibid.)</note> President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> believed that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would still agree with him <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0319"/>that they should first see what are the
                        real possibilities. Then the two leaders could meet and examine what such
                        terms as guaranteed access really mean.</p>
                    <p>President Sukarno said that as far as he knew, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had told Sulzburger that he would be willing to
                        have a “businesslike meeting” with President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>. Besides, the Italian Ambassador had contacted
                        President Sukarno with a message from Prime Minister Fanfani who had
                        reported that he had contacted <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> on the question of a meeting and that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had said yes he would be quite
                        willing to meet President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> asked the Presidents
                        whether they thought it would be more useful for him and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to meet now or to examine the
                        outstanding questions in close detail first. President Sukarno responded
                        that it is the view of the nations represented at Belgrade that President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> should meet. As a preliminary
                        move it would no doubt be fruitful to have contacts between the Foreign
                        Ministers. But those should be followed as soon as possible by a meeting of
                        the President and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said he agreed that
                        this is a very dangerous situation. If <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> should go ahead and sign a peace treaty and then
                        if there should be interference with access to Germany then we could have a
                        war before Christmas. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> was troubled by the actions of the Soviet Union in
                        this connection. Why for example had the Soviets fired off another hydrogen
                        bomb today?</p>
                    <p>President Sukarno acknowledged that he too was anxious about that. He had
                        understood the President to say however that he was not opposed in principle
                        to meeting <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said he was not
                        opposed in principle: he just did not want a meeting to occur and to fail.
                        If <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could get an understanding of
                        the real meaning of the promise of access, then we could talk freely. He
                        emphasized that we want peace. At the same time we want it understood that
                        if the Soviet Union should sign a peace treaty with East Germany a full
                        guarantee of the right of free access and communications for the people of
                        Berlin must be included. That is what we ask.</p>
                    <p>As the meeting adjourned President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> explained that he planned to give the Presidents a
                        written reply to their message before their departure from Washington.<note n="5" xml:id="d117fn5">For text of the President's reply, September 14,

                        public statements in an effort to create an impression that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is favorably disposed toward the appeal
                        of the Belgrade conference for direct US-Soviet negotiations over Berlin. He
                        has implied, however, that the initiative for making a definite proposal
                        rests with the US and depends on US willingness to demonstrate a desire for
                        “businesslike negotiations.” Khrushchev's development of a more conciliatory
                        line over the past week suggests that he considers the neutralists'
                        initiative an opportunity to increase world pressure on the West for early
                        four-power negotiations.</p>

                        leader went to some lengths to attribute to each of the Western leaders a
                        willingness to begin discussions on Germany and Berlin, and drew the
                        conclusion that “glimpses of hope now have appeared” for “peaceful talks.”
                        Soviet propaganda promptly claimed that this speech met with a favorable

                    <p>At the conclusion of Nehru's visit on 11 September, the joint communiqué
                        contained a statement on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        agreement to “enter into negotiations with the Western powers … .”<note n="6" xml:id="d118fn6">For text, see ibid., pp. 7-8.</note>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Berlin</p>
                    <p>Despite <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s asserted
                        readiness for negotiations, he has adhered to the maximum position that
                        negotiations should be directed toward a German treaty and the creation of a
                        free city in West Berlin. He has also continued to assert that the question
                        of access to Berlin could be resolved. He told Sulzberger that any peace
                        treaty would “legalize” free access to West Berlin and that the “substance”
                        would remain unchanged. He included the standard qualification, however,
                        that in the absence of Western agreement to a treaty with both Germanys,
                        communications to and from Berlin would require agreement with East Germany.
                        The Soviet-Indian communiqué also stated that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had informed Nehru of Soviet proposals for
                        “international guarantees” of a free city and for “safeguarding the freedom
                        of communications” between West Berlin and the outside world.</p>
                    <p>This reference may reflect a reported acceptance by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> of Nehru's proposal that the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, as part of a separate treaty with
                        East Germany, guarantee East Germany's execution of the treaty's provisions
                        ensuring free access. Thus far, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has refrained from offering such a guarantee of
                        East Germany's performance after a separate treaty. This modification of his
                        position is probably intended to encourage Nehru to continue his
                        efforts.</p>
                    <p>Nehru apparently intended his proposal to serve as a basis for US-Soviet
                        talks. It underscores his repeated references to the need for solving <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0322"/>the access question first, which he
                        feels is the key to a larger East-West accommodation on Germany. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s acceptance presumably
                        accounted for the Indian leader's cautious optimism in discussing prospects
                        for a negotiated settlement with reporters on his return to New Delhi. Nehru
                        will presumably raise this proposal during his visit to Washington in early
                        November, if not through diplomatic channels before then.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> probably feels that
                        Western acceptance of Nehru's plan as the basis for a negotiation would open
                        up a wide field for maneuvering to gain de facto Western acceptance of a
                        separate peace treaty and a change in the legal basis for Western access.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may also feel that an
                        offer to act as a guarantor of East German actions may satisfy Western
                        requirements by maintaining an outward appearance of continued Soviet
                        responsibility.</p>
                    <p>Statements by bloc leaders and officials continued to stress the
                        inevitability of a peace treaty before the end of the year. Discrepancies
                        over the timing of a peace conference, however, suggest that no final
                        decision has been made in Moscow. News accounts quoted Polish party
                        secretary Gomulka as stating the treaty would be signed in December, but the
                        Rumanian minister in Washington told US officials that a treaty would be
                        concluded in November. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is
                        reported by the Indian press to have sounded out Nehru on the possibility of
                        attending a German peace conference in November. Moscow also is reported by
                        Western diplomats to have begun pressure on Helsinki to join bloc countries
                        in signing a treaty with East Germany. Statements by East German leaders
                        suggest that following the elections in both East and West Germany the bloc
                        may publish a revised draft of a treaty, together with a declaration on a
                        free city for West Berlin.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s remarks to Sulzberger
                        and a statement by a Soviet official at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> indicate that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        still views <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration of the Berlin

                        told Sulzberger that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could take up the
                        issue if the four powers failed to agree; the Soviet representative said the

                        West wished to settle it through negotiations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Military Measures</p>
                    <p>Moscow has continued to reinforce its diplomatic position by announcements of
                        military measures designed to impress world opinion with Soviet resoluteness
                        over Berlin. On 10 September Moscow published the communiqué of the third
                        meeting of the Warsaw Pact this year.<note n="7" xml:id="d118fn7">For
                            reports of the meeting, see <hi rend="italic">Pravda,</hi> September 10,

                        The ministers of defense and military chiefs met in Warsaw on 8 and 9
                        September to discuss specific questions “concerning enhancement <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0323"/>of military preparedness of the troops
                        belonging to the joint forces” of pact states. The communiqué stated that
                        the chiefs of the general staffs have been instructed to work out “practical
                        measures to strengthen further the defenses” of the pact members. This
                        provides a broad cover for further bloc moves to counter Western military
                        measures, which the Soviet press is carefully reporting. It is believed that
                        some of the satellites have followed the Soviet lead in retaining conscripts
                        and have called up limited numbers of reservists. Additional steps might
                        include the holding of large-scale exercises and even the movement of
                        additional Soviet troops into Eastern Europe. In a speech on 10 September,
                            <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> alluded to continued
                        movement of troop convoys which would be observed by the populace.</p>
                    <p>The pact meeting coincided with an announcement by Moscow that, between 13
                        September and 15 October, tests would be held in the Pacific of “more
                        powerful and improved versions of multistage carrier rockets of space
                        vehicles.”</p>

                        statements justifying the resumption of testing and rejecting the US-British
                        proposal for a ban on atmospheric tests to improve his political position in
                        the Berlin crisis. He told Sulzberger that the development of several “super
                        powerful bombs” would force the “aggressors to think twice” and that the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was obliged to assure itself of
                        “no lesser capability” than the US, Britain, and France. He claimed that “we
                        shall continue the tests we have started because we cannot ignore the danger
                        that now is being created by the Western countries.” His reference to
                        testing a 100-megaton device, however, was amended to read only the
                        “explosive device” for such a weapon.</p>

                        forced on the Soviet Union in order to “counter the threats of aggression.”
                        He labeled the US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> proposal as a propaganda
                        maneuver to permit the US to resume underground tests and allow France to
                        continue its program and thereby obtain a “unilateral advantage” over the
                        Soviet Union. The Soviet Government, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> stated, “cannot and will not make such a deal.”
                        He added that nuclear tests can be ended “everywhere and forever only on the
                        basis of complete and general disarmament.” But he also claimed that the
                        US-Soviet bilateral talks on disarmament show that the US “does not even
                        want to approach general and complete disarmament.”</p>

                    <p>The Soviet delegate at the Geneva nuclear talks read this statement into the
                        record at the 340th meeting on 9 September and then pressed for a communiqué
                        stating that the conference had suspended its work, with no reference to a
                            US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> proposal to state that the talks
                        had recessed until after the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General
                        Assembly debate. Although the Soviet delegate agreed to a final statement
                        that the conference would be recessed, he clearly implied in the discussion
                        that any further meetings would require agreement on the governmental level
                        and that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would resume talks on a

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"> Nehru's Visit</p>
                    <p>The Indo-Soviet communiqué was a restatement of Soviet and Indian views with
                        prime emphasis on the former. The leaders agreed on the “fact” of two
                        Germanys, on the need for “complete and general disarmament under strict and
                        effective international controls,” and on support for anti-French and
                        anti-Portuguese liberation movements in Algeria, Angola, and Goa. On other
                        issues, however, Nehru merely “noted” the Soviet position as “explained” by

                    <p>On September 21, 1961, the intelligence community issued National
                        Intelligence Estimate 11-8/1-61, “Strength and Deployment of Soviet Long
                        Range Ballistic Missile Forces.” <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>
                        11-8/1-61 revised and updated <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-8-61,
                        “Soviet Capabilities for Long Range Attack,” issued June 7, 1961,
                        particularly Annex C on “Soviet Long Range Ballistic Missile Forces.” For

                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-8/1-61 concluded that “new
                        information, providing a much firmer base for estimates on Soviet long range
                        ballistic missiles, has caused a sharp downward revision in our estimate of
                        present Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> strength but strongly
                        supports our estimate of medium range missile strength. We now estimate that
                        the present Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> strength is in the
                        range of 10-25 launchers from which missiles can be fired against the US,
                        and that this force level will not increase markedly during the months
                        immediately ahead. We also estimate that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> now has about 250-300 operational launchers equipped with
                        700 and 1,100 n.m. <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0325"/>ballistic
                        missiles. The bulk of these <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> launchers
                        are in the western <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, within range of
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> targets in Europe.” The estimate
                        concluded further that “Soviet professions of greatly enhanced striking
                        power thus derive primarily from a massive capability to attack European and
                        other peripheral targets. Although Soviet propaganda has assiduously
                        cultivated an image of great <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> strength,
                        the bulk of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s present capability
                        to attack the US is in bombers and submarine-launched missiles rather than
                        in a large <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force. While the present
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force poses a grave threat to a
                        number of US urban areas, it represents only a limited threat to US-based
                        nuclear striking forces.”</p>
                    <p>The estimate noted, however, that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        was pressing development of a second generation <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> system that would probably be ready for operational use
                        sometime in the latter half of 1962. “After this point, we anticipate that
                        the number of operational launchers will begin to increase significantly,”
                        with the force level in mid-1963 approximating 75-125 operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers. For text, see ibid., pages

                    <p>In telegram 1691 to Paris, September 22, 1961, the Department of State
                        reported that in a 3-hour discussion the previous day Soviet Foreign
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and Secretary of
                        State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had laid out their
                        respective positions on Berlin. “<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s presentation did not deviate from standard version
                        of main Soviet themes as developed at Vienna and thereafter.” <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stressed that the “current Berlin
                        crisis was essentially of Soviet creation” and that changes in status quo
                        desired by the Soviets “would move against vital interests and fundamental
                        commitments of US.” For text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v14">

                        that later became known as the “Pen Pal Correspondence.” <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> repeated standard Soviet
                        positions on Berlin and Germany but suggested <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>

                    <p>I met with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> at the
                        Soviet Chancery at 16th Street at 12:00 noon on September 25th. He has
                        suggested lunch on several occasions, stressing that while he had no
                        specific instructions, he would like to see me to exchange views. I left at
                        1:25 p.m.</p>
                    <p>Nothing of importance came out of the discussion. For the most part,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> advanced the line that
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had opened up in
                        Vienna and which is now readily available to us in <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> and elsewhere. His purpose apparently was to induce me to
                        spell out more specifically what we were willing to do.</p>
                    <p>I repeated what the Secretary said to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d121fn2">See <ref target="#d120">Document 120</ref>.</note> and suggested that since <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> and I were unlikely to be able to
                        negotiate a settlement, it was a waste of time for us to go over the same
                        ground in general terms. At some stage it would be necessary for them to
                        spell out precisely what they mean by their assertion that they would not
                        interfere with access to Berlin. It would be up to the negotiators to find
                        common ground if, as I hoped, common ground existed.</p>
                    <p>I added that in my opinion it would be a mistake for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> to go into any conference unless it
                        was well established in advance that agreement would result from it; that if
                        they negotiated directly and the negotiations failed, the danger of war
                        would vastly increase, since it would appear there was no other
                        alternative.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> asserted that Attorney
                        General <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert Kennedy</persName>'s speech<note n="3" xml:id="d121fn3">Presumably a reference to remarks the Attorney
                            General had made on “Meet the Press,” September 24.</note> was
                        provocative and threatening and that it would undoubtedly require some
                        response from Moscow. I asked him if he had really read what the Attorney
                        General had said. When he said he had only seen the newspaper reports, I
                        pointed out that the Attorney General had referred to the use of nuclear
                        weapons only in defense of Berlin and our interest <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0327"/>there, and not in any threatening sense; it
                        was a clear statement of an obvious fact, i.e., that if we were attacked, we
                        would defend ourselves with whatever weapons were necessary.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> on many
                        occasions had used more provocative words, i.e. he could destroy Britain
                        with eight or ten bombs, that he could blow up Italy with even fewer, and
                        that the Acropolis would be one of the casualties along with the Greek
                        people if Greece did not cooperate with the U.S.S.R.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> responded mildly, stressing
                        that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s remarks had been
                        made in private conversations and not intended for publication. They were
                        simply his way of expressing his concern over the possibility of war,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>I then asked <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> what <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had meant by his willingness to
                        see the United Nations facilities transferred to Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> stated that he had no
                        instructions on this subject and had only heard indirectly that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had said this.</p>
                    <p>He went on to say that the United Nations should not be in New York, that
                        this was not good for us or others, since there were groups of Americans
                        with violent views. From what he knew therefore the Soviet would be willing
                        to negotiate the development of United Nations activities in Berlin. I said
                        that we had no position on the subject but that in one way or another it
                        might come up in discussions later.</p>
                    <p>In the last ten minutes I expressed the strong hope to <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> that he and his government have a
                        better understanding of our country and its interests and objectives than I
                        sometimes felt they had. In the course of this particular discussion I made
                        the following points:</p>
                    <p>1. That President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Adlai Stevenson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DAH1">Arthur
                            Dean</persName>, Jack McCloy, myself, and others in the Administration
                        had come into office with a strong desire to reach some kind of agreement
                        with the Soviet Union which would allow us to work constructively to
                        establish a peaceful and rational world;</p>
                    <p>2. That none of us could be classed as haters of the Soviet Union or in any
                        way antagonistic to the interest of the Soviet people. And although we were
                        disappointed and felt that we had been rebuffed, we had in no sense given up
                        hope that some better relationship could develop in the future;</p>
                    <p>3. That if the present leadership of the United States is unable to reach
                        reasonable agreements with the Soviet Union we will be replaced by others
                        who will follow a far harder line.</p>
                    <p>Even though the Kremlin should somehow maneuver us into a position over
                        Berlin that was to their immediate advantage and to our disadvantage, it
                        would be a pyrrhic victory since it would leave America embittered, and no
                        less militarily powerful;</p>
                    <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0328"/>
                    <p>4. That he must realize that while we were anxious to find ways of living and
                        working with the Soviet Union, we were not afraid, and they should not ever
                        assume that we lacked the will to protect our interests.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out that he personally had made remarks suggesting that we lacked
                        that will and that this was dangerous. Anyone who had not known the British
                        people in 1939 might have assumed their unwillingness to fight as they did
                        in 1940 and 41 when they faced up to the entire Nazi power. I said that
                        while the British, French, and Americans were often divided on small
                        matters, they were united on large issues, and it was important that he
                        understand this.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> hastened to comment on my
                        reference to the story that he had said we would not fight. He said that the
                        question had been asked him by someone in the Germany Embassy whose name he
                        did not know, and it was taken entirely out of context. He seemed
                        particularly anxious to correct what he said was a false impression.</p>
                    <p>My general impression was that <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> was less anxious to argue than usual and was
                        almost mellow in his general approach. There were none of the angry replies
                        encountered on previous occasions.</p>

                    <p>Moscow's treatment of the conversations between Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and its general commentary on
                        Berlin suggest that the Soviet leaders are confident formal negotiations
                        will be arranged. Following the third meeting between Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on 30 September, <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> on 2 October quoted from a US statement that the sessions
                        were cordial, that they were related to the possibility of East-West
                        negotiations, and that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was
                        likely to meet with President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>. Soviet press coverage of the first two discussions
                        merely reported that the meetings had been held but gave no indication of
                        the general atmosphere or possible results. The coverage of <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0329"/>2 October, therefore, conveys an impression
                        that the talks are proceeding favorably.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi> also injected a hopeful note in an article
                        which claimed that the Soviet people did not believe that the international
                        situation was entirely covered with the “leaden clouds of war.” A speaker at
                        a public lecture in Moscow on 26 September predicted that the <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> talks would be followed by negotiations and cited
                        the US-Soviet agreement on disarmament principles as a favorable sign. The
                        East German party organ <hi rend="italic">Neues Deutschland</hi> echoed this
                        line in an editorial of 28 September, stating, “Everyone realizes now that
                        there will be negotiations.” Polish party First Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> on 30 September also asserted that
                        “on our side nothing stands in the way of a peaceful solution of the German
                        problem by means of fruitful negotiations and mutual agreements.” The Polish
                        news service reported that “<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> circles”
                        expect an East-West foreign ministers conference to be followed by a summit
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>This general line suggests that Moscow views the <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> talks as
                        the opening of a decisive phase in the Berlin crisis. A number of Soviet
                        journalists, in their contacts with American officials, have stressed that
                        the next several weeks will determine the future course for the bloc and
                        have hinted that the Soviet year-end deadline for a solution could be
                        revised if negotiations were in process or scheduled. The third secretary of
                        the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City stated that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was not disposed to sign a separate East German treaty if
                        there were real possibilities for East-West agreement.</p>
                    <p>A <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> correspondent claimed that the next six weeks
                        would be most important for setting a date for a meeting at the highest
                        level. He added that the date could be “sometime in 1962” provided the US
                        agreed to the principle of negotiations. A <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> correspondent also emphasized negotiations and warned that
                        if they failed to materialize, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would have some “very interesting warnings” at
                        the Soviet party congress.</p>
                    <p>Communist sources in London were apparently responsible for press reports
                        that the bloc foreign ministers would convene in November to consider the
                        next move on Germany. According to these reports, the bloc would review the
                        results of current East-West contacts, such as the <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> conversations, and decide whether to proceed with a
                        peace treaty before the end of the year. If no East-West negotiations were
                        arranged by November, the bloc would go ahead as announced and convoke a
                        peace conference, but that if it was clear the West was prepared to
                        negotiate, the Warsaw Pact ministers would recommend postponement of a peace
                        conference until “two or three months” into 1962. Other press reports quoted
                        “Communist diplomats” as saying that the bloc might postpone a separate
                        treaty if the West agreed to negotiate a Berlin settlement.</p>
                    <pb n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0330"/>
                    <p>These semiofficial statements have been accompanied by an official effort to
                        appear responsive to Western views that the agenda of any formal
                        negotiations should be broader than the Soviet proposal of a peace treaty
                        and free-city status for West Berlin. The Soviets have begun to emphasize
                        European security and certain limited partial disarmament measures to show
                        willingness to enlarge the scope of East-West discussions. The Soviets have
                        made it clear, however, that European security discussions are no substitute
                        for a German treaty.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Disarmament</p>
                    <p>A Soviet Government memorandum submitted to the 16th <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly<note n="2" xml:id="d122fn2">Dated September
                            26. For text, see Documents on Disarmament, 1961, pp. 496-504.</note>
                        suggested reaching agreement on freezing military budgets, denouncing the
                        use of nuclear weapons, banning war propaganda, concluding a nonaggression
                        pact between the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries and the
                        Warsaw Pact nations, withdrawing foreign troops from the territories of
                        other countries, taking measures against the further spread of nuclear
                        weapons, creating atom-free zones, and taking steps to lessen the danger of
                        surprise attack.</p>
                    <p>All of these measures have appeared as provisions of earlier Soviet
                        disarmament proposals, although not necessarily as “partial” disarmament
                        measures. The increase in the number of partial disarmament measures listed
                        may be aimed at countering neutralist dismay over the Soviet position that a
                        test ban solution can be reached “only” through agreement on general and
                        complete disarmament. Several of the measures—a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw Treaty nonaggression pact, establishment of a
                        nuclear-free zone in Central Europe, withdrawal or at least reduction of
                        foreign troops in Europe, and a ban on supplying nuclear weapons to other
                        countries—are probably calculated to appeal to groups in Western Europe who
                        favor tying European security arrangements to a German settlement.</p>
                    <p>The memorandum's call for reciprocal commitments not to be the first to use
                        nuclear weapons is at variance with a recent statement by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. The Soviet leader—who in past
                        years had advocated such an agreement—told New York Times correspondent
                        Sulzberger early in September, “It would be untimely at present to say that
                        in the event of war, atomic weapons would not be employed.” He added that if
                        both sides were to promise not to employ nuclear weapons but retained their
                        stockpiles and the imperialists unleashed a war, “any side” that felt it was
                        losing would “undoubtedly use its nuclear bombs.”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in his talks with Nehru
                        and Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> stated he was willing to “accommodate” President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> but that he could not
                        infringe on East German sovereignty. He suggested that the access to West
                        Berlin could be guaranteed in separate documents which would be attached to
                        a peace treaty; the documents would be signed by both the German Democratic
                        Republic and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and in this way
                        assuage East German sensibilities.</p>
                    <p>Bloc leaders continue to stress possible guarantees for future access to West
                        Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> said on 30 September
                        that the peace treaty will allow a “solution of the West Berlin problem in a
                        way … which will provide it with free communications with the world and
                        international guarantees of the interested powers or guarantees of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.” On the same day, Czech President
                        Novotny asserted that if Berlin had become a question of Western prestige,
                        “Let us agree on guarantees for West Berlin, as clearly indicated by
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.”</p>

                    <p>The bloc's intention to sign a separate peace treaty by the end of the year
                        continues to be muted in statements and propaganda, although it appears
                        occasionally. <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> referred to the
                        deadline in speeches during a visit to Prague; an <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi> editorial on 29 September mentioned a treaty by the end
                        of the year; and East Germany has continued to stress the deadline. Further
                        information on economic planning to achieve a position to deal with any
                        Western reprisals after conclusion of a separate treaty was contained in an
                        intercepted East German message, which referred to the goal of being
                        “completely free from economic disruption by 1 December 1961.”</p>

                    <p>On October 6, 1961, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                        met with Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> for 2 hours at the White House. The latter stated,
                        among other things, that if the United States would not agree to a peace
                        treaty resolving the larger German issues, i.e., borders and nuclear
                        weapons, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be willing to sign
                        an agreement on Berlin alone. However, in that case the United States would
                        have to agree to resolve the larger issues separately. The President again
                        expressed the U.S. view that Soviet proposals to change the status quo in
                        Berlin did so at the expense of U.S. interests. For text of the memorandum

                            <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> is concerned about receipt of the
                        U.S. draft of the agreement, as time is now limited. He hopes that our draft
                        will be expedited. The present agreement shows that we started to carry it
                        out only in the second half of 1960 and that we lost at least three months
                        in planning. Mr. Krylov said they want to carry out the new agreements from
                        January 1, 1962.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName> stated that he looks
                        forward to meeting <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName>. We expect
                        our draft to be ready shortly and want the Soviets to have ample time to
                        study it. We do not want to lose momentum. <persName corresp="#p_RSK1">Romanovsky</persName> was here and it was agreed that we are both
                        anxious to continue and expand the number of exchanges.<note n="2" xml:id="d124fn2">See <ref target="#d108">Document 108</ref>.</note> Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName> said that our graduate
                        students have had difficulty in obtaining access to libraries, etc., in the
                        Soviet Union. Our most advanced graduate students are capable of studying in
                        the best institutes in the U.S. The Soviet draft spoke of 50 students a
                        year. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName> stated that he was
                        disappointed in this number and hopes to get a larger flow of students in
                        the negotiations. This will benefit both sides. We should not skimp on the
                        number. We also want a balance in the general categories and a balance
                        between the natural sciences on the one hand and the humanities and social
                        sciences on the other hand. We try to maintain such a balance in the U.S. We
                        hope for expansion across the board and for balance. To destroy the myths
                        about each other, we could go further in radio, TV, book and film exchanges.
                        The experience in the performing arts under the present agreement
                        demonstrates this and we should apply it to the other media. We must develop

                    <p>Mr. Krylov said that they want to expand exchanges. We now have known each
                        other for four years as far as concrete cultural exchanges go. We know what
                        is more acceptable in each country. He stated that they are ready to speak
                        about cooperation. They are ready and can cooperate in medicine,
                        agriculture, and technical matters. He said that they had provided for 50
                        students in their draft because the U.S. had fallen below its quota for
                        academic year 1961-62.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName> stated that we can get more
                        students if we can assure them that their research experience will be as
                        useful in the Soviet Union as their experience here. If we can take some of
                        our brilliant young scholars into Soviet institutes and word of this gets
                        back, we can step up the program.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Krylov said that in principle, there is no objection in the Soviet Union
                        to letting U.S. students into institutes, but an institute in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is like a research center in the U.S. He
                        said that the institutes cannot incorporate U.S. scholars into their own
                        plans. However, in some fields they could let them in.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName> stated that a Soviet
                        student admitted to M.I.T. gets what a Soviet student does in his own
                        university plus what he gets in a Soviet institute. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName> wondered if this is a matter of
                        semantics.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Krylov said that their students find that a subject is not well done in
                        an American university and want to move to another U.S. university. He said
                        that they have over 15,000 foreign students in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> who are genuinely satisfied with their programs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName> said that we are not
                        talking about undergraduates, but rather advanced graduate students from the
                        U.S. to whom you must give the best research conditions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Krylov said that we might discuss this; it is not a simple problem but it
                        could be discussed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName> said that we must work
                        towards six months advance notice of names and groups. Our people cannot
                        wait until the last minute, or we will lose good people, especially in the
                        cultural presentations field.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Krylov said that he thought that we could work out things based on our
                        experience with the first two agreements. He said that if the U.S. takes two
                        and one-half months to study the Soviet draft, that does not give them two
                        and one-half months to study the U.S. draft if we are to discuss the
                        agreements together in November. He stated that Zhukov said that he will
                        turn the money over for agreements with other countries if the U.S. is not
                        interested in enlarging its contacts. Mr. Krylov said that the European
                        students in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> usually stay one to
                        two years, and are advanced students. The Asians stay longer and their
                        background is weaker, yet they are in a hurry to get home.</p>
                    <pb n="306" xml:id="pg_306" facs="0334"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName> said that as more new
                        countries are opened up, we get more undergraduates in the U.S. He said that
                        we have about 5,000 foreign students in the country under Department
                        auspices. The total number of foreign students in U.S. colleges last year
                        was about 53,000, of which some 10% received some government assistance. Of
                        the 5,000, over half are fully financed by the U.S. Government; the other
                        half received partial assistance from the U.S. Government.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Krylov stated that the bulk of foreign students in the Soviet Union are
                        under agreements. He said that there are 15,000 foreign students in the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He added that the expenses of the
                        students at the University of Lumumba are fully covered.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Coombs</persName> said that his job is first,
                        direct responsibility for State Department exchanges and second,
                        coordination and policy-making for all U.S. exchanges. He pointed out that
                        several government departments are involved in exchanges; <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> has about 5,000. <gloss target="#t_HEW1">HEW</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>, etc., are
                        concerned with specialized exchanges.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Krylov said that in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, they have
                        a simpler system—the Committee handles all the exchanges.</p>
                    <p>The meeting ended with expressions of good wishes on both sides.<note n="3" xml:id="d124fn3">In a telephone conversation with <persName corresp="#p_SFG1">Siscoe</persName> on October 18 Secretary

                            the Soviets be given a U.S. draft exchanges agreement that could be

                        situation as complex as Berlin could be settled peacefully if one much
                        simpler in many ways, such as Laos, could not. “I do not say that the

                        negotiations begin over Germany and Berlin; but certainly it would greatly
                        improve the atmosphere.” <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> noted as well that
                        “the acceleration of attacks on South Viet-Nam, many of them from within

                        letter to Berlin and Germany, largely restating U.S. views on the issue,
                        though emphasizing his willingness to look for a pragmatic resolution with
                        which both sides could live. He agreed to have Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> conduct discussions on the issue

                        actions in case of a conflict over Berlin. “What I want is a sequence of

                        security considerations require that the United States embark upon a program

                    <p>At a National Security Council meeting called on November 2 to discuss
                        resumption of nuclear testing in the atmosphere, Central Intelligence Agency
                        analyses of recent Soviet tests were presented, indicating that there had
                        been 37 or perhaps 39 tests at 3 sites, the largest detonation possibly
                        exceeding 60 megatons. The tests had impressed the intelligence community
                        with their broad nature. In subsequent discussion, <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0336"/>

                        no position to compete with them.” The President indicated his intention to
                        release a statement to the effect that “no decision has yet been made on
                        testing [in the atmosphere], but that authorization has been given to

                        Congress of the <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss>
                        <note n="2" xml:id="d127fn2">October 17-31.</note> was initially prepared

                        the United States views on this event. At your discretion, you are
                        authorized to draw on it in discussions with appropriate local
                        officials.</p>
                    <p>Only time and specific developments will reveal the true significance of this
                        Congress. The following brief analysis is, therefore, only tentative.</p>
                    <p>1. The general course of the Congress indicated careful advance preparation;
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s dominance in Soviet
                        leadership was readily apparent in the re-endorsement of the basic lines of
                        the 20th Party Congress and in the choice of the focal points for the 22nd
                        Congress. The dominant aspects of the Congress (campaigns against the Stalin
                        era; the anti-party group, Albania and indirectly Communist China; strong
                        reaffirmation of the 20th Congress line; and the lack of emphasis on new
                        Party Program) reflect <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        decision to reassert strongly Moscow's primacy in the bloc and the world
                        communist movement.</p>
                    <p>2. In foreign policy, reaffirmation was given to (a) avoidance of actions
                        entailing a serious risk of nuclear war; (b) endeavors to seek through
                        negotiations with the West agreements favorable to Soviet objectives; (c)
                        assertive Soviet efforts in the underdeveloped areas, and (d) a <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0337"/>vigorous “struggle” under “peaceful
                        coexistence” in East-West relations.</p>
                    <p>3. The moves against Stalinist methods, anti-party group and Albanian
                        leadership were undoubtedly related and have the effect of clarifying
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s personal leadership
                        status. The move to correct the Albanian problem was intended as a thinly
                        veiled challenge to the Chinese Communists within the context of a
                        “domestic” <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> Congress and Soviet East
                        European considerations (Albania).</p>
                    <p>4. The open attacks on Stalin and the specific revelations of the brutal acts
                        attributed to his regime have evoked public discussion within the Soviet
                        Union and are likely to result in considerable disorientation and confusion
                        of the Soviet people unless the effects are carefully channeled. These,
                        combined with public discussion in recent years of incompetence and
                        deceptive acts of minor officials, could undermine faith in the Party
                        leadership.</p>
                    <p>5. The form and method of the Chinese Communist response are still not
                        indicated. One timing factor supporting <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s move may have been Communist China's basic
                        internal economic weaknesses at this time. The 22nd Congress' developments
                        confirmed earlier indications that the 81 Party Statement of 1960<note n="3" xml:id="d127fn3">See <ref target="#d16fn1">footnote 1, Document
                            16</ref>.</note> was a “papering over” effort required by the failure to
                        achieve a real reconciliation of views.</p>
                    <p>6. The Party Program was obscured by other events at the Congress. Quite
                        aside from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s desire to
                        focus attention on other matters, this treatment appears consistent with the
                        fact that the Program was not an inspiring document.</p>
                    <p>7. It is too early to assess the ultimate effects of the changes in the top
                        Party organs, but <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        pre-eminence has not suffered. While it is clear there is opposition to
                        individual <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> policies, there
                        is no evidence of any organized opposition to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s leadership as such. An action against the
                        anti-party group will, however, serve as a warning to those who might be
                        tempted to go too far in opposing the specific policies of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                    <p>8. The reasons for “lifting” the apparent deadline for a separate German
                        treaty were not clear.<note n="4" xml:id="d127fn4">
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> told the Congress that
                            if the West showed readiness to settle the “German problem,” then “we
                            shall not insist on the peace treaty being signed necessarily before 31
                            December 1961.” (Current Weekly Intelligence Review, October 20; Central
                            Intelligence Agency: Job 79-S01060A) <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wrote <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> in a
                            November 9 letter that “in order to create the best possible conditions
                            for the achievement of an agreed settlement the Soviet Government has
                            decided not to insist that the peace treaty be signed by the end of this
                            year.” In the same letter <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> proposed, since the West had taken issue with
                            his earlier proposal to station a token force of Soviet troops in West
                            Berlin when it became a “free city,” that no Four Power forces be
                            stationed there but instead a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force be
                            introduced to guarantee the status of the city. For text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v06">

                            pp. 45-57.</note> One factor undoubtedly was the apprehension <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0338"/>that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the West were on a collision course. Another factor
                        may well have been the normal evolving of a pre-negotiation position. In any
                        event, the build-up of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces and the
                        firmness of the West on basic principles clearly played an important role.
                        The fact of the existence of discussions with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> afforded <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> the opportunity to lift the deadline without an
                        apparent loss of face.</p>
                    <p>9. Clearly, Soviet objectives and their determination to achieve those
                        objectives remain undiluted; however, the implications for Western policy as
                        regards intra-bloc and Sino-Soviet ramifications are not fully evident. It
                        is, however, evident that the West must anticipate a continuous application
                        of pressure on sensitive issues and, particularly, must prepare for an
                        increased communist drive in the underdeveloped areas. As regards the Berlin
                        and German problem, there is even a greater need for unity, preparedness and
                        firmness of purpose.</p>

                    <p>While debates with Soviets on ideological grounds are generally not
                        productive believe it would be useful emphasize difficulty which Communist
                        ideology places in way of development of friendship and peaceful coexistence
                        between our countries. President might refer to 81 party delegation
                        [declaration?] which stated US imperialism had become enemy of peoples of
                        world. Could also refer to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s definition of peaceful coexistence with US as
                        “intense economic, political, and ideological struggle” and point out that
                        this could also serve as definition of cold war and hardly basis for real
                        friendship. US believes every country should have system which suits it best
                        and does not pretend that one particular system is bound to prevail
                        throughout world. Communist belief to contrary is source of much friction
                        between us. Believe would be useful for President to state US welcomes
                        increased prosperity of Soviet people and wishes them success in future.</p>
                    <p>If occasion arises might be useful hit some of most common Soviet
                        misconceptions about US. Soviet people for example unaware magnitude
                        unemployment compensation, role of US regulatory agencies, etc. In referring
                        to peaceful competition between states President could stress role of
                        competition in US and describe our anti-monopoly legislation. Might be
                        useful mention minimum wage and average income, widespread ownership of
                        large corporations, high tax on large incomes, and general evolution
                        capitalist system in US.</p>

                    <p>Just in case you couldn't lay your hand on TOMMY's suggestions in regard to
                        the <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> interview, I am
                        enclosing another copy.<note n="2" xml:id="d129fn2">Printed as <ref target="#d128">Document 128</ref>.</note> I think TOMMY's
                        suggestions are very good, and should be carefully considered. However,
                        while I agree that ideological themes are nonproductive, there is a terrible
                        temptation to have the President go into some of them. But, I imagine that
                        for a President to get into that swamp would probably not be wise.</p>
                    <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0340"/>
                    <p>However, I do agree with TOMMY's paragraph on the subject, and I think the
                        President should hit the history of the Soviet Union and the fact that ever
                        since its existence in 1917, it has never had normal relations with any
                        country; the reason being, as TOMMY points out, their adherence to a system
                        which they claim is bound to prevail throughout the world. In this
                        connection, I think he might dwell somewhat on the theme of “peaceful
                        coexistence,” pointing out that its constant repetition by Soviet leaders is
                        curious, since heretofore there had been many different systems of social
                        organization in various countries without the problem of existing
                        side-by-side ever having been raised.</p>
                    <p>1. Other aspects which the President might treat are those of Stalin's
                        actions in foreign affairs which, at this stage, might be capable of
                        discussion. One of these might be the Korean war and, as an offshoot
                        thereof, the Soviet Government's sponsorship on a world-wide basis of the
                        charge that we had used bacteriological warfare in Korea. This has since
                        been dropped completely by Stalin's successors, but it might be worth
                        bringing up as an example of why our relations have been troubled.</p>
                    <p>2. We should try and think of some news or information which is banned to the
                        Soviet people and this brings us directly to the question of nuclear
                        testing. As you know, while the Soviet intention to test was published in
                        the Soviet press, there was no report on individual explosions and nothing
                        has appeared in the Soviet Union in regard to the fifty megaton one. The
                        President might take the theme that facts are facts, regardless of opinion
                        or ideological coloration, and that to censor everything that goes into a
                        country is hardly a defensible exercise in the modern world.</p>
                    <p>3. In relation to 2., the President might emphasize the role of secrecy in
                        Soviet international dealings and its destructive effect on the development
                        of any state of confidence with the Soviet Union, quite apart from its
                        obvious denial of elementary freedom.</p>
                    <p>4. The President might refer to the history of our military posture since the
                        end of the war, dwelling on the complete demobilization of the mightiest
                        force which had ever been assembled until just prior to the Korean war; our
                        military budget was some fourteen billion dollars (I think this is right,
                        but I am not sure) and pointing out as a reply to customary Soviet
                        assertions on United States militarism, that facts and their sequence would
                        demonstrate that our present budget resulted entirely from Soviet
                        actions.</p>
                    <p>5. The President might dwell on our view of the role and potential usefulness
                        of the United Nations, with special reference to the troika principle,
                        pointing out that this principle was in itself contrary to the purposes of
                        the Charter. He could indulge in a little philosophy here by pointing out
                        that if there is a general denial of objective individuals who could serve
                        as international civil servants, this would reduce the world <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0341"/>to a jungle of competing systems, and that
                        what seemed to be at fault here was the absence in Soviet doctrine of any
                        objective morality. Even the most elementary of games requires some rules if
                        they are to be played by people.</p>
                    <p>The President might, as a closer, state that when the Soviet Union came to
                        realize that Bolshevism was not the system designed for every country and
                        has only been installed by force or conquest, and that as the leaders began
                        to act as the head of a national state, there would then be the first
                        beginnings of a possibility of a reasonable and normal relationship between
                        the United States and the Soviet Union. He might point out, in this
                        connection, that it is not specific United States interests which are being
                        served by our world-wide involvement, but that we are, in effect, a third
                        force, helping weaker countries to resist the efforts of a great power to
                        install its system against the will of the recipients. The President might
                        note, in this connection, that there has never been a case in history where
                        the people of a country have voted in the communist system in any free vote
                        or choice.</p>
                    <p>I enclose a list of points which were drawn up by the research boys here,
                        which you may find useful.<note n="3" xml:id="d129fn3">Not found.</note> I

                        find amusing, and possibly useful for this exercise.</p>

                    <p>In a November 16, 1961 letter to Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> wrote that the United States viewed the situation in
                        which the Republic of Vietnam found itself “as one seriously endangering
                        international peace and security. Our support of the government of President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> we regard as a
                        serious obligation, and we will undertake such measures as the circumstances
                        appear to warrant.” He asked that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, as head of a government that was a signatory to
                        the Geneva Accords, “use all the influence that you possess and endeavor to
                        bring the DRV to the strict observance of these Accords.” For text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v06">

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">East-West Developments</p>
                    <p>Now that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> has been installed as
                        chancellor in West Germany and the Soviet 22nd party congress has ended,
                        Moscow is stepping up the pace of its diplomatic moves in an effort to
                        induce the West to agree to early negotiations on Berlin and Germany. As
                        part of their effort to create an impression of reasonableness on Berlin,
                        Soviet leaders since the congress have used a wide variety of maneuvers to
                        convey an impression of flexibility in any negotiations. The substance of
                        the Soviet position, however, remains unchanged from the presentation made
                        by Foreign Minister Gromyko in his talks in the United States.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>-Kroll Talks</p>
                    <p>On 9 November, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> indicated to
                        West German Ambassador Kroll that he could accept in “principle” the
                        ambassador's suggestion for a combination of four-power and bilateral
                        agreements to ensure Berlin's viability and free access. Soviet officials
                        then passed to Western journalists in Moscow a four-point plan characterized
                        as a “radical change” in Soviet policy, which included some of Kroll's
                        suggestions but was more in line with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s approach in the United States.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, who requested the 9
                        November meeting with Kroll, invited him to exchange opinions informally on
                        Berlin. Kroll put forward a five-point plan: 1) a four-power agreement on a
                        status for West Berlin and free access; 2) a Soviet-East German agreement in
                        which the Ulbricht regime would undertake to respect the four-power accord;
                        3) agreement on “technical matters” by West Berlin and East Germany, as well
                        as the Western powers; 4) a four-power agreement to establish committees on
                        a German peace treaty and disarmament, with East-West German subcommittees
                        to deal with nonpolitical matters; and 5) an agreement among interested
                        powers to stop “provocative propaganda.”</p>
                    <p>In his reply, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> indicated
                        that he could accept this plan “in principle” and countered with three
                        conditions: 1) abolition of the occupation status; 2) termination of any
                        formal legal or political ties between Bonn and West Berlin; and 3)
                        stationing of a “symbolic” Soviet troop contingent in West Berlin to carry
                        out Soviet guarantees.</p>
                    <p>On this last point Kroll gained the impression that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was less than adamant. Earlier
                        indications of possible Soviet flexibility on this <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0343"/>point appeared in late September and early
                        October. A Soviet official said on 2 October that the stationing of Soviet
                        troops in West Berlin was not “absolutely required.” According to a British
                        Foreign Office account of the <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>
                        talks in London, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> failed to
                        make a “vigorous response” to the prime minister's statement that he failed
                        to “see the logic” of the Soviet demand to station troops in West Berlin.
                        After his talks with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in
                        September, Prime Minister Nehru said in a press conference in Tashkent that
                        as a concession the Soviet leader would not insist on the addition of Soviet
                        troops.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet version of Kroll's plan immediately conveyed to Western
                        correspondents included the four-power agreement on Berlin and the
                        Soviet-East German agreement, but added the vague formula used by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in his talks in the US—that the
                        Western powers would undertake “to respect East German sovereignty.” The
                        Soviet version dropped the details of Kroll's suggestion for four-power
                        committees on a peace treaty and disarmament and merely referred to the
                        conclusion of a peace treaty as the final step. Such exploitation of Kroll's
                        plan suggests that the Soviet leaders view it as an opportunity to stimulate
                        debate in the West and to increase public pressure for formal negotiations
                        to determine the Soviet bargaining price for agreement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s effort to convince Kroll
                        that negotiations might yield dividends for the West was evident in the
                        premier's statement concerning the wall in Berlin, which he claimed was
                        erected on Soviet orders because <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> was too weak to carry out such an important
                        decision. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that the
                        wall could be removed if there were satisfactory agreement on Berlin, but
                        that as long as the “reasons” for the wall existed, it would have to remain.
                        After Kroll noted that Berlin was the old German capital and that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> should keep this in mind, the
                        Soviet premier said he “agreed” that the feelings of the German people must
                        be respected and that there should be no “victors or losers” in the
                        settlement of the problem.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s responses to Kroll's
                        point—that the better the Berlin settlement, the easier it would be to
                        handle the peace treaty question—gave Kroll the impression that the peace
                        treaty was much more important to the Soviets than the Berlin problem.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had told Belgian
                        Foreign Minister Spaak last September that Berlin is “not too
                        important.”</p>
                    <p>The only point on which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        became heated in his conversation with Kroll was in reference to the
                        situation at the sector boundary in Berlin. He stated that moving tanks
                        around in Berlin was a “childish” performance and stressed that the West
                        would never induce the Soviets to become “traffic police.” The contrast
                        between <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s pose of
                        flexibility on an over-all Berlin solution and his vehemence on the present
                        situation in Berlin suggests that one purpose of the current campaign of
                        conciliation is to divert attention from the continuing <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0344"/>and uncompromising effort to reduce Western
                        rights in Berlin to a minimum.</p>
                    <p>Moscow reported that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        received Kroll but said nothing about the details of the conversation. A
                            <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> dispatch reporting on Kroll's
                        recall to Bonn quoted a Bonn spokesman as saying that Kroll “aired ‘some
                        views’” that were unauthorized by Bonn, without mentioning them, and cited
                        West German commentators who “admit that, under certain circumstances,
                        Kroll's actions could have moved the negotiations on the German and West
                        Berlin problems off dead center.” <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss>
                        portrayed Kroll as a victim of “the atmosphere of mistrust and suspicion
                        within the Western camp” and reported that Bonn is ready to sacrifice him in
                        order to restore Washington's confidence on the eve of <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>'s visit.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Other Soviet Moves</p>
                    <p>While the Soviet press has been giving relatively restrained treatment to
                        Berlin developments, a speaker at a public lecture in Moscow on 12 November
                        ridiculed the Western response to the 13 August measures. According to the
                        US Embassy, the speaker said, “All they could do was talk.” When the East
                        Germans instituted controls over Western civilian officials, the US was said
                        to have made a “show of force”; however, the appearance of Soviet tanks
                        exposed the emptiness of the US action, and US acceptance of East German
                        control was said to be confirmed when the US adopted similar controls on 1
                        November. The speaker claimed that these events show the West is accepting
                        the existence of the German Democratic Republic, and that negotiations will
                        lead to the peaceful resolution of the West Berlin problem.</p>
                    <p>Two days before <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        conversation with Kroll, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> used
                        his informal conversations with the US, British, and West German ambassadors
                        at a reception to underscore the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
                        readiness for four-power negotiations on a Berlin settlement. On the
                        substance of the Berlin and German questions, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> made no mention of a peace treaty and confirmed that
                        the negotiations could be limited to the problems of access to, and the
                        status of, West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>While insisting on demilitarization of West Berlin and the termination of the
                        occupation status, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stated
                        that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was prepared to provide the
                        “most formal guarantees” that East Germany would respect an agreement.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> brought up the question
                        of civilian access to Berlin, distinguishing it from military access and
                        claiming that it was not covered by an agreement. He asserted that Bonn had
                        already accepted East German control of West German civilian traffic to
                        Berlin. He was adamant in rejecting any formal link between Bonn and Berlin,
                        but did indicate that present financial and economic ties could be
                        maintained.</p>
                    <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0345"/>
                    <p>According to Kroll, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> told him
                        on 7 November that Soviet Ambassador Smirnov has instructions to meet with
                        Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, apparently to
                        resume their mid-August discussion on Berlin. When Smirnov met with
                            <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> on 16 August, he
                        maintained that the Soviet Union desired a negotiated settlement on Berlin
                        and would consider any proposals. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> indicated he would continue the discussion after
                        the West German elections. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        said, however, that Smirnov, in renewing his discussions with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, would definitely not be carrying
                        an invitation for him to visit Moscow.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Comment on Party Congress</p>
                    <p>Soviet officials have been seeking to persuade Western representatives that
                        developments at the party congress should be interpreted as a favorable sign
                        for Western interests, particularly in regard to Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Yuriy Zhukov</persName>, the chairman of the State
                        Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations, who often claims to have <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s confidence in matters of
                        foreign affairs, told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> that he hoped President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> was aware of the significance of the party congress
                        as a victory for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s policy
                        of peaceful co-existence. Earlier, on 25 October, a Soviet Foreign Ministry
                        official claimed that the “anti-party group” had opposed efforts to improve
                        Soviet-American relations and implied that the renewed attacks on the group
                        should therefore be regarded by the West as an encouraging development.</p>
                    <p>Along this line, Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetzov told the British
                        ambassador on 7 November that he approved of the interpretation of the party
                        congress given by The Economist on 21 October. This article viewed the
                        withdrawal of the deadline on a German treaty as a respite for the West
                        which should be used to probe Soviet intentions and to determine what a
                        solution of the Berlin problem on a “mutually acceptable basis” means in
                        Soviet terminology. The article also pictured <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> as a “man determined to stick to his set course”
                        and the policies and reforms carried out since Stalin's death.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Disarmament and Test Ban Issues</p>
                    <p>In private conversations with various <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        delegates, Soviet delegates have urged agreement to add three neutral
                        countries to the original ten-nation committee for future disarmament
                        negotiations. However, at a 14 November luncheon with US delegates, two
                        Soviet delegates said nothing about a five-five-three forum and repeated the
                        old proposal for a “troika” forum—five Western, five bloc, and five neutral
                        representatives. The US delegation believes that the Soviets returned to the
                        troika in order to re-establish a basic negotiating position. In his 15
                        November speech opening the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> disarmament
                        debate, Soviet delegate <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> called
                        for “equal” representation for the bloc, the West, and the neutrals.</p>

                    <p>A Soviet spokesman told a Canadian delegate that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is anxious to start disarmament negotiations “early next
                        year.” The spokesman also said that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has detected growing reluctance on the part of the US to
                        begin disarmament talks and presumes the reason is that the US believes such
                        talks would be interpreted as a sign of weakness on Berlin. Soviet delegates
                        have also expressed willingness to conduct further bilateral talks with the
                        US, particularly on the question of a new disarmament forum.</p>
                    <p>There has been no Soviet response to the US-British notes of 13 November<note n="2" xml:id="d131fn2">For text of the U.S. note, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1961</hi>, p. 594.</note> urging a
                        resumption of the Geneva test ban talks later this month. The sharp attack
                        by Soviet delegate Tsarapkin on the Anglo-American <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution calling for a resumption of negotiations on a
                        test ban treaty and the bloc vote against the resolution makes it clear that
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will reject the US-British offer
                        and continue to insist that the nuclear test question be considered only in

                        of the NSC Committee on Atmospheric Testing Policy, stated that for a major
                        portion of nuclear weapons technology, above-ground testing was “essential
                        to any substantial future progress” and that urgency had been “added to the
                        need for progress by the substantial advances made by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.” He recommended implementation of a
                        program to consist of a minimum of 27 test shots in the atmosphere over a
                        period of approximately 3 months beginning in the spring of 1962. In
                        National Security Action Memorandum 116, December 1, the President approved
                        Seaborg's list of 27 atmospheric tests “for the purpose of proceeding with
                        preparations,” subject to several provisos, including a review of the list
                        “with a view to reduction in the numbers of atmospheric tests, in the length
                        of time of the test series, and in the resulting radioactive fall-out.” The

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>: Mr. President, I am
                        happy to get this interview from you, and I would like to tell you quite
                        frankly that your election to the high post of President of the United
                        States office was met with great hope by public opinion in our country. In
                        connection with this, I would like to ask you the following question—</p>
                    <p>The President. May I just say that I appreciate very much your coming to the
                        United States. I also appreciate the opportunity to talk, through you and
                        through your newspaper, to the people of the Soviet Union. I think that
                        communication, an exchange of views, an honest report of what our countries
                        are like and what they want and what the people wish, is in the interests of
                        both our countries and in the interests of peace. So we are delighted to
                        have this opportunity.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>: I would like to ask you
                        the following question. Mr. President, during the election campaign, on
                        several occasions you expressed good intentions with respect to the
                        necessity of improving Soviet-American relations. On the occasion of your
                        Inauguration as President of a great country, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Nikita Khrushchev</persName>, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Leonid Brezhnev</persName>, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme
                        Soviet of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, in their message to

                        countries can succeed in radically improving our relations and the
                        international situation. They also expressed confidence that we can, step by
                        step, liquidate the existing suspicion and distrust, and thus bring
                        cooperation between our peoples. On its part, the Soviet government is
                        always ready to support any good endeavor in that direction, and to do its
                        best for the establishment of a stable peace in the world, in order that all
                        peoples may live in friendship and without hatred among them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, what do you think about the present state of Soviet-American
                        relations, and what in your opinion must be done by the American as well as
                        the Soviet governments to improve the relations between our two
                        countries?</p>
                    <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0349"/>
                    <p>The President. Well, I would say that the relations today are not as
                        satisfactory as I had hoped they would be when I first took office. In fact,
                        one of the first things that I did on becoming President was to commit the
                        United States to an earnest effort to achieve a satisfactory agreement with
                        the Soviet Union on the cessation of nuclear tests. As a result of that
                        effort, at the end of March, we sent our representatives, along with Great
                        Britain's, to Geneva for the first time with a complete treaty which we
                        tabled for discussion.<note n="3" xml:id="d134fn3">For text of this March 21
                            draft, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1961</hi>, pp.
                            55-65.</note> I had hoped that this would be one area where we could
                        make real progress. It would lessen the contamination of the air, it would
                        be a first step towards disarmament, and I felt that if we could achieve an
                        agreement in this area, we could then move on to the other areas of
                        disarmament which required action.</p>
                    <p>We were not successful. And, as you know, we were in fact still at the table
                        in Geneva in August when, still negotiating, the Soviet Union resumed its
                        tests which must have been in preparation for many months, at the very time
                        that the conversations were going on. So that has been a disappointment.</p>
                    <p>In addition, Berlin and Germany have become, I think, areas of heightened
                        crisis since the Vienna meeting, and I think extremely dangerous to the
                        peace, which I am sure—I know—both of our people want.</p>
                    <p>I think that the Soviet Union and the United States should live together in
                        peace. We are large countries, energetic people, we are steadily providing
                        in both our countries an increase in the standard of living. If we can keep
                        the peace for 20 years, the life of the people of the Soviet Union and the
                        life of the people of the United States will be far richer and will be far
                        happier as the standard of living steadily rises.</p>
                    <p>Where we feel the difficulty comes is the effort by the Soviet Union to
                        communize, in a sense, the entire world. If the Soviet Union were merely
                        seeking to protect its own national interests, to protect its own national
                        security, and would permit other countries to live as they wish—to live in
                        peace—then I believe that the problems which now cause so much tension would
                        fade away.</p>
                    <p>We want the people of the Soviet Union to live in peace—we want the same for
                        our own people. It is this effort to push outward the communist system, on
                        to country after country, that represents, I think, the great threat to
                        peace. If the Soviet Union looked only to its national interest and to
                        providing a better life for its people under conditions of peace, I think
                        there would be nothing that would disturb the relations between the Soviet
                        Union and the United States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>: That is very
                        interesting. However, as a citizen of the Soviet Union, as a member of the
                        Communist Party, I cannot agree with <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0350"/>you, in that part of your answer where you are saying that we are trying
                        to “communize” the world. At the 22nd Party Congress, which, in our opinion,
                        was an historic event, we adopted a program of communist development and we
                        said that we are against any export of revolution, but we are also against
                        any export of counter-revolution. If we turn to facts, there are many
                        countries in the world in the affairs of which, from our point of view the
                        United States is interfering. Yesterday, I saw a TV program which was being
                        shown to millions of Americans, where your commentator asserted that the
                        whole world is under complete threat of the communists to capture the world.
                        We would like to see an end put to this situation.</p>
                    <p>Our government and our party believe that every people chooses such a system
                        of government as they like. Austria chose the capitalist way of development,
                        although American and Soviet troops were there. But Cuba has chosen another
                        way of development. And we would be happy if you, Mr. President, were to
                        state that the interference in the affairs of Cuba was a mistake. We hope
                        that the Cuban people will consolidate their own way of life—as well as the
                        Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Brazil, and many other countries.</p>
                    <p>The President. May I just say, without getting into a debate, that the United
                        States supports the idea that every people shall have the right to make a
                        free choice as to the kind of government they want. In the case of Cuba, let
                        me remind you that the <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>
                        revolution was originally supported by the great majority of the people.
                        When <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> was leading the
                        revolution, the statement was made that there would be free elections, and
                        freedom for the people, and progress for the people. But <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> has not kept that commitment. Until
                        the present government of Cuba will allow free and honest elections, in our
                        opinion, it cannot claim to represent the majority of the people. That is
                        our dispute with Cuba.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Jagan, on the other hand, who was recently elected Prime Minister in
                        British Guiana is a Marxist, but the United States doesn't object—because
                        that choice was made by an honest election, which he won.</p>
                    <p>If the people of any country choose to follow a communist system in a free
                        election, after a fair opportunity for a number of views to be presented,
                        the United States would accept that. What we find to be objectionable, and a
                        threat to the peace, is when a system is imposed by a small militant group
                        by subversion, infiltration, and all the rest.</p>
                    <p>If the Soviet Union and this country could develop their own resources, and
                        if you permitted the peoples of the world to develop in the way they wish to
                        develop, then, if any nation should choose a communist system, we would
                        recognize and accept that. And if they chose another system, then we would
                        hope that you would recognize and accept that, too. If we could get that on
                        both sides, I believe the Soviet Union and the <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0351"/>United States, which have so much to gain from peace, could
                        live in peace.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>: I understand you, Mr.
                        President, and I am very happy to hear these words from you, because as you
                        know, the future of the world depends in many respects on the relations
                        between the United States and our country. Let the people decide what way of
                        development they want to choose. However I would like to draw your attention
                        to the following historical parallel. When the Bolsheviks, headed by V.I.
                        Lenin, came to power, all the capitalist world was shouting that they were
                        plotters and that there was no freedom in Russia but in 44 years our country
                        became a great power. But this is not the issue. I would like to ask you
                        another question—</p>
                    <p>The President. You are a newspaper man and a politician.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>: In our country every
                        citizen is a politician, because we like our country very much. The young
                        and the old like the socialist system of our country and we are ready to
                        fight for it until its victorious end. You are proud of your country, Mr.
                        President, and we are also very much proud of our own country, and we are
                        very proud of our party, and we are proud of V.I. Lenin.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, sometimes it's said that in order to improve the relations
                        between our countries, it is necessary to start with the settlement of small
                        problems. Others believe that too many small issues have accumulated and
                        that perhaps it would be better to start with a big act. We believe that
                        such a big act was the visit by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Nikita
                            Sergeyevich Khrushchev</persName> to the United States in 1959. But
                        unfortunately the results of that trip were not completely
                            satisfactory.<note n="4" xml:id="d134fn4">This sentence, as published in
                                <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi>, reads: “But the positive results of
                            that trip were wrecked and brought to nothing by the well-known actions
                            of the then American administration”. [Footnote in the source
                            text.]</note> Mr. President, what is your attitude toward the idea of
                        concluding a pact of peace between the United States and the Soviet Union?
                        That would be a great step forward.</p>
                    <p>The President. I think we should have not only an agreement between our
                        countries, but take those steps which make peace possible. I don't think
                        that paper, and words on paper, are as significant as looking at those areas
                        which provide tension between our two systems and seeing if we can dispel
                        that tension.</p>
                    <p>One of those areas now is the problem of Germany and Berlin. If we could make
                        progress there, then in my opinion it would provide a most important step in
                        improving our relations in other areas.</p>
                    <p>I stated that if we had been able to get an agreement on the nuclear tests
                        cession, that would lead to other agreements on disarmament. If we can make
                        an agreement successfully which provides peace in Central Europe, if we can
                        conclude our efforts in Laos and insure a government <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0352"/>and a country which are neutral and
                        independent, as Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        and I agreed at Vienna, then we would be able to move into other areas of
                        tension. I believe, as I have said, if we can now make an agreement on a
                        satisfactory basis on Berlin and Germany, which is the most critical
                        area—because it represents a matter of great interest to both our countries,
                        and great concern to our peoples—then we could take other steps. If we can
                        solve the problem of Germany and Berlin, I believe we can find our relations
                        substantially improved.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>: Thank you, Mr.
                        President, this is a most worthy thought. Especially because, as I
                        understand you, you intend to talk seriously on these problems with our
                        government. Let me say that the German problem is of great importance to our
                        country, for many reasons. Not only for strictly political reasons, and not
                        only because of prestige considerations. As you know we have allies—Poland,
                        Czechoslovakia, and a number of other countries. However, to date we haven't
                        heard any sober voices from the West affirming the integrity of the borders
                        existing in Europe and it would be very important to hear that. But there is
                        also another aspect to the German problem. In our country, in the Soviet
                        Union, there is not a single family that did not lose some kin in the war.
                        You know we are trying to put out the smouldering coals of the last war in
                        Central Europe. But we do not wish only to play the role of a political
                        fireman, as it were, though it is very important. In the heart of every
                        Soviet citizen, in the soul of every Soviet citizen, there are, as you know,
                        coals still burning from the last war and they are burning his soul and does
                        not let him sleep quietly. Thus, solution of the question of a peace treaty
                        is the hope and tranquillity in the heart of every Soviet man. After all we
                        are still singing songs about those who did not come home from the war. I
                        know that you participated in the war, that you are a hero of the war, and
                        this is why I am talking to you in such lofty words. But this, if you wish,
                        is a side-line.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, in 1958, if I am not mistaken, our government suggested to the
                        government of the United States—of course, the previous administration was
                        in power then—that the trade relations between our countries be normalized.
                        Now, as you know, the trade relations between our countries are in a very
                        lamentable condition. Before I left for the United States, I had a
                        conversation with my friends from the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and they
                        asked me to inquire with you whether there are any prospects of improving
                        the trade relations between our countries. After all there is a very old
                        truth: together with goods, together with the exchange of goods, there also
                        come better relations among peoples.</p>
                    <p>The President. Let me say that I know that the Soviet Union suffered more
                        from World War II than any country. It represented a terrible blow, and the
                        casualties affected every family, including many of the families of those
                        now in government.</p>
                    <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0353"/>
                    <p>I will say that the United States also suffered, though not so heavily as the
                        Soviet Union, quite obviously. My brother was killed in Europe. My sister's
                        husband was killed in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The point is that that war is now over. We want to prevent another war
                        arising out of Germany. I think the important thing between the United
                        States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is not to create the
                        kind of tension and pressure, which in the name of settling World War II
                        increases the chances of a conflict between the Soviet Union and its allies
                        on the one hand and the United States and its allies on the other. What we
                        should attempt to do is work out a solution through negotiation which will
                        make it possible to keep the peace in Central Europe. And that is the aim of
                        this government.</p>
                    <p>Now in regard to trade, one of the first things I did on becoming President
                        was to change governmental policy which provided for the admission of crab
                        meat. This was not a matter of great dollar value, but had some symbolic
                        importance, and was a matter which Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had spoken about on several occasions.</p>
                    <p>My own judgment is that, if we can solve the problems that we are now talking
                        about, particularly in Berlin, and ease the general tension, trade will then
                        increase. What has diminished trade in recent months has been the difficulty
                        which we have experienced in Germany and Berlin. I would hope that trade
                        could be expanded, and in my judgment it would expand immediately, if we can
                        bring about a peaceful and satisfactory solution to the interests of all in
                        Germany and Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>: I shall communicate your
                        words to our readers with a feeling of satisfaction. We have always thought
                        and still think of the Americans as the realists. It is your energy, your
                        realistic approach, that has helped you to create such a wealthy country.
                        But now I would like to ask you frankly, Mr. President, because this idea
                        was expressed by you in several instances, whether you seriously think that
                        the social changes which are happening in the world today are the result of
                        actions in which Moscow has its hands? I would like to remind you of one
                        thing. You know, in France when the bourgeois revolution won, the
                        aristocratic Europe accused France of every mortal sin. When the October
                        revolution won, all the world of the rich condemned that revolution. But
                        this revolution won! You mentioned that a Marxist came to power in British
                        Guiana. Do you think that events occurred there according to our
                        instructions? Of course, we can't give you any assurances that there won't
                        be social changes in the world, although you will call it the result of the
                        “hands” in Moscow.</p>
                    <p>The President. Let me say, as I indicated, if the people of these countries
                        make a free choice, that they prefer the communist or socialist or any other
                        kind of system, then the United States and the people of the United States
                        accept that. That is why I gave the example of British Guiana. But of course
                        I do not hold and I do not say that the Soviet Union is responsible <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0354"/>for all the changes that are coming
                        in the world. For example, since the end of World War II, the British Empire
                        has been turned into independent states, I think 15 of them. The French
                        community has been turned into 21 independent states. There are many changes
                        in the world. Western Europe has joined closer together in the Common
                        Market. These are not the result of the communists' efforts. There are many
                        changes, as I have said, throughout the world. People want to live in
                        different ways. That is what we want, also. If they have a fair opportunity
                        to make a choice, if they choose to support communism, we accept that. What
                        we object to is the attempt to impose communism by force, or a situation
                        where once a people may have fallen under communism the communists do not
                        give them a fair opportunity to make another choice.</p>
                    <p>We had been under the impression that the Yalta Agreement and the Potsdam
                        Agreement provided for a free choice for the peoples of Eastern Europe. They
                        do not, in our opinion, today have a free choice. You may argue that they
                        may want to live under communism, but if they do not they are not given the
                        opportunity to change.</p>
                    <p>We believe that if the Soviet Union—without attempting to impose the
                        communist system—will permit the people of the world to live as they wish to
                        live, relations between the Soviet Union and the United States will then be
                        very satisfactory, and our two peoples, which now live in danger, will be
                        able to live in peace and with a greatly increased standard of living. And I
                        believe we have such vast economic opportunities now in both of our
                        countries that we should consider how we can get along, and not attempt to
                        impose our views, one on the other or on anyone else.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>: Of course, Mr.
                        President, I did not expect in such a short period of time I would succeed
                        in converting you to another belief—just as you did not expect to convert
                        me. You have talked with our Chairman, the First Secretary of the Central
                        Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and he did not succeed
                        in convincing you, nor did he try to do so. This, as you know, is a matter
                        of personal outlook. One man may consider certain elections to be free,
                        while another would consider those elections non-democratic. For example, in
                        a number of countries of Latin America, great revolutionary changes are
                        taking place. For a long period of time you considered that Trujillo <note n="5" xml:id="d134fn5">Generalissimo Rafael L. Trujillo y Molina,
                            Commander in Chief of the Dominican Armed Forces.</note> was elected in
                        a democratic way. You have been saying the same about the regime of the Shah
                        of Iran as well. But let us not engage in an argument and let us turn to the
                        next question.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, may I ask you the following question? It is well known that
                        the Soviet government has declared its readiness to accept <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0355"/>any proposal of the Western powers on
                        international control and inspection, if agreement on general and complete
                        disarmament is reached. At the same time, the Soviet government does not
                        exclude the possibility of reaching agreement on a number of measures which
                        may decrease the danger of war and which could be effected in the nearest
                        future. Such proposals are, for instance, the proposals on the freezing of
                        military budgets, renunciation of the use of nuclear weapons, the conclusion
                        of a non-aggression pact between <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
                        the Warsaw Pact countries, withdrawal of foreign troops from the territories
                        of other countries, the establishment of a nuclear free zone, or measures
                        against the danger of surprise attack. What, in your views, are the
                        prospects of general and complete disarmament, and of decreasing
                        international tensions?</p>
                    <p>The President. Inasmuch as the Soviet Union and the United States agreed in
                        the declaration of principles in September,<note n="6" xml:id="d134fn6">For
                            text of the agreed principles for disarmament negotiations, September

                            439-442, or U.N. doc. A/4879, September 20, 1961.</note> at the end of
                        the <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> talks, on the goal of general and
                        complete disarmament, the problem now becomes an attempt to implement that
                        goal, stage by stage. The Soviet Union and the United States have a basic
                        disagreement which must be resolved on this question. We believe that there
                        must be adequate inspection, to make sure that each side is disarming and
                        staying in accordance with the agreements which they make. The Soviet Union
                        has stated that it will permit us, or the international body, to inspect
                        those weapons which are destroyed but will not permit us to carry out an
                        inspection to see what weapons remain. One side could destroy a hundred
                        bombers but still have a thousand or two thousand bombers left. If you are
                        really going to provide for orderly disarmament, it seems to me you have to
                        inspect not only those weapons which have been destroyed, but also those
                        weapons that remain. Otherwise we do not have any guarantee of security for
                        either side. If we can agree to an effective inspection system so that each
                        country can know that the other is living up to its agreement, then, in my
                        opinion, we can move into general and complete disarmament.</p>
                    <p>That is why I thought it so vitally important that we make an agreement on
                        cessation of nuclear testing as the first step, and then proceed step by
                        step through atomic weapons, through missiles, through the level of ground
                        forces, the Navy, and all the rest. If we can get agreement on that, then we
                        can move toward general and complete disarmament.</p>
                    <p>I think it would be helpful if <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the
                        Warsaw pact engaged in a commitment to live in peace with each other, I
                        certainly believe we should take every conceivable step to prevent surprise
                        attack. I believe that if the relations between our countries can be
                        normalized, there will be less military buildup on both sides, but we cannot
                        now withdraw our <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0356"/>troops from
                        Europe, way back across the Atlantic Ocean, when you merely withdraw your
                        troops to the Soviet Union which is only a few hundred miles away. This is
                        why we need some understanding of what is going to be the situation in
                        Berlin and in Germany. And that is why I hope negotiations will take place
                        between our governments quickly and will come to a successful
                        conclusion.</p>
                    <p>The statement has been made on many occasions that we object to the signing
                        of a peace treaty, that we regard that as a belligerent act. That is not the
                        point. It is our view that the statement which the four powers made at
                        Geneva in 1955 providing for the reunification of Germany represents the
                        soundest policy.<note n="7" xml:id="d134fn7">For text of this Four-Power

                        up a wall in a city, we believe, only increases tensions rather than
                        diminish them. And we believe that, if the German people were permitted to
                        be reunified, adequate steps could be taken to protect the security of all
                        involved.</p>
                    <p>Now we recognize that today the Soviet Union does not intend to permit
                        reunification, and that as long as the Soviet Union has that policy, Germany
                        will not be reunified. The question now is whether the Soviet Union will
                        sign a treaty with the East German authorities which will increase tension
                        rather than diminish it. As I said in my speech at the United Nations,<note n="8" xml:id="d134fn8">For text of the President's address to the U.N.
                            General Assembly, September 25, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of

                        recognize that the Soviet Union can sign any treaty it wishes with the East
                        German authorities. What we find to be so dangerous, however, is the claim
                        that that treaty will deny us our rights in West Berlin, rights which we won
                        through the war, rights which were agreed to by the Soviet Union, the United
                        States, Britain, and France at the conclusion of the war, and which we
                        believe should be continued. But if you sign a treaty with East Germany and
                        those rights are subject to the wishes of the East German authorities, it
                        seems to me that that is going to increase tension. If the Soviet Union
                        attempts in that treaty to turn over jurisdiction over West Berlin to the
                        East German authorities, against the wishes of the people of West Berlin—if
                        the lines of communication and access, from West Berlin to the outside world
                        and the West, are completely under the control of East German authorities to
                        cut any time they so wish—then this treaty does not bring peace, it only
                        increases the danger.</p>
                    <p>Now I am hopeful that, in the conversations and negotiations which we hope to
                        have with the Soviet Union, assurances will be given which will permit us to
                        continue to exercise the rights which we now have in West Berlin, as a
                        result of the existing four power agreement, and will <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0357"/>permit free access in and out of the city.
                        We do not want to stay in West Berlin if the people there do not want us to
                        stay. But they want us to stay. When they decide that they don't want us, we
                        will leave. But as long as they wish us to stay, it seems to me that the
                        rights which are ours by agreement should be maintained. I am hopeful that
                        the Soviet Union will agree with this, and in particular will agree to
                        permit supplies and people to move in and out of West Berlin freely. Then we
                        can, in my opinion, reach a peaceful settlement in the center of Europe, and
                        if we can reach an agreement on this question, then I believe our relations
                        will greatly improve.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>: You just answered the
                        question I was going to ask. But I cannot agree with you. I am not a
                        specialist in the field of disarmament, but as I understand it, the
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> agreement was a very important step
                        forward, and we hope that the efforts by specialists who will be authorized
                        by our governments will lead to better results. And now a few words about
                        Germany. If I understood correctly the translation, I have heard a very
                        unrealistic term. I have in mind the term “East German authorities.” It
                        would be more pleasant to hear “government of the German Democratic
                        Republic.” You don't like the German Democratic Republic. We don't like the
                        Federal Republic of Germany, but we have diplomatic relations with the
                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, we have very good trade relations
                        with it. Thus, we are realists. If the government of the United States were
                        not saying “East German authorities” but were to say “government of the
                            <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>,” that would be very good and
                        realistic.</p>
                    <p>And now a second point. We would like to sign a peace treaty together with
                        our World War II allies, and we hope that it will be so. It would be a great
                        happiness not only for our government but also for our people. Nobody
                        intends to turn West Berlin over to East Germany. That does not make sense.
                        There is the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and there is the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> with its capitalist system. Let's sign a
                        peace treaty and let us guarantee freedom for West Berlin by every means—by
                        troops of the four powers, by United Nations troops—and let's thus guarantee
                        its rights. But this is a problem for future negotiation. Now a few words
                        about access to West Berlin. Why complicate such a simple problem?
                        Communication to West Berlin runs over 100 miles through the territory of
                        the German Democratic Republic. If one needs to visit West Berlin, if it is
                        necessary to send people, food or other goods there, then it is very
                        elementary to ask permission for that of the government of the GDR.
                        Sometimes I feel—and I am saying this to you very frankly—that some evil
                        people are attempting to complicate simple things and thus are deliberately
                        creating tension. Yesterday, when I was talking with your closest advisers,
                        I gave this example: if a man has his nervous system extremely strained, he
                        is irritated by every noise, every sound and everything is taken by him very
                        suspiciously. Such a man can create much trouble. We hope that the
                        negotiations <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0358"/>which will take place
                        in the near future will be objective, realistic, and will be conducted in an
                        atmosphere of complete calm.</p>
                    <p>The President. May I just make one brief response? All Berlin was put under
                        four-power authority by the agreements at Potsdam. East Berlin, which was
                        under the immediate authority of the Soviet Union, has now been turned over
                        to East Germany in violation of those agreements. It is no longer
                        effectively under four-power control. And now the Soviet Union seeks to
                        place Soviet troops in West Berlin. It does not suggest that the troops of
                        the other three powers be placed in East Berlin. In other words, the Soviet
                        Union now seeks to share in the control of West Berlin. That is the first
                        point that is in question. The second is this question of the rights of
                        access in crossing East Germany. As I gather it, you would give the East
                        German authorities—you say East German government—the power to interfere
                        with that traffic. It is stated that they would not do so, but we have no
                        assurances in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s
                        statements which vary from week to week. In my opinion, if such an agreement
                        is signed, if our rights on the communication lines between the West and
                        West Berlin—which are now governed by the Soviet Union—are turned over the
                        East German authorities, and if the East Germans should interfere with that
                        right of access, for one reason or another, then this would provide for
                        heightened tension, the Soviet Union might come to the support of East
                        Germany and we would find ourselves, instead of having settled this now,
                        once more face to face.</p>
                    <p>The reason why we have been reluctant to recognize East Germany as a
                        sovereign power is that we do not recognize the division of Germany. In our
                        opinion the German people wish to have one united country. If the Soviet
                        Union had lost the war, the Soviet people themselves would object to a line
                        being drawn through Moscow and the entire country. If we had been defeated
                        in war, we wouldn't like to have a line drawn down the Mississippi River.
                        The Germans want to be united. I think it should be possible to provide for
                        that under conditions which will protect the interests of all concerned. But
                        the Soviet Union believes that it is more in their interest to keep Germany
                        divided.</p>
                    <p>Now the question is—given that decision—can we provide for the protection of
                        our rights in West Berlin, which were agreed to in 1945 by the Soviet Union,
                        so that this is not a continuing crisis? In attempting to work out a
                        solution of the problems which came about as a result of World War II, we
                        don't want to increase the chances of World War III. All we wish to do is
                        maintain a very limited—and they are a very limited number of troops of the
                        three powers in West Berlin and to have, for example, an international
                        administration on the Autobahn so that goods and people can move freely in
                        and out. Then we can have peace in this area for years. But if East Germany
                        is going to exercise the right of authority over that access, we are going
                        to have continued tension <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0359"/>there—and
                        I simply do not see, given the strong interests of both of us in having
                        peace in this part of Europe, why that is a wise decision. I am hopeful
                        instead that the negotiations which we are anxious to see take place will
                        bring about an agreement on this area which will recognize fairly the
                        interests of all.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>: Mr. President, since I'm
                        talking to you in a very frank and friendly manner, I would like to ask you
                        to imagine, at least for a moment, the following impossible thing. Imagine
                        that you were an officer, a veteran of the Soviet Navy, who fought in World
                        War II. You won the war, and then the very events occurred which are now
                        taking place. One of the parts of Germany—the Federal Republic of
                        Germany—does not recognize the borders which have been established after the
                        war. It is again building up its armed forces. The Chancellor of that
                        country goes to the United States to talk to the President of the United
                        States and they have secret talks. The spirit of revanchism is very high in
                        that part of Germany. What would your attitude be toward this, if you were a
                        veteran of the Soviet Navy?</p>
                    <p>The President. If I were a Soviet veteran, I would see that West Germany now
                        has only nine divisions, which is a fraction of the Soviet forces. Nine
                        divisions. It has no nuclear weapons of its own. It has a very small Air
                        Force—almost no Navy, I think perhaps two or three submarines. So it is not
                        a military threat. Its nine divisions are under the international control of
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and subject to the command of the
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> organization, which is made up of
                        15 countries of Europe which altogether have, in West Germany now, about 22
                        or 23 divisions—about the same number as the Soviet divisions in East
                        Germany. So that I do not see that this country represents a military threat
                        now to the Soviet Union, even though I recognize how bitter was the struggle
                        in World War II—in the same way that Japan today represents no threat to the
                        United States, even though 20 years ago there were 4 years of war in the
                        Pacific against the Japanese. The power of countries changes—weapons
                        change—science changes—without missiles, without nuclear capability, with
                        very few divisions today, I don't believe West Germany is a military
                        threat.</p>
                    <p>Then I would look at the power of the United States, and I would look at the
                        power of the Soviet Union, and I would say that the important thing is for
                        the Soviet Union and the United States not to get into a war, which would
                        destroy both of our systems. So as a Soviet veteran, I would want the Soviet
                        Union to reach an agreement with the United States which recognizes the
                        interests and the commitments of the United States, as well as our own, and
                        not attempt to enforce single-handedly a new situation upon the United
                        States which would be against previous commitments we had made. The Soviet
                        Union made a commitment in regard to Berlin in 1945. Germany today is
                        divided. Germany today is not a threat to the Soviet Union militarily.</p>
                    <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0360"/>
                    <p>The important thing is to attempt to reach an accord which recognizes the
                        interests of all; and I believe that can be done with respect to Germany. I
                        recognize that there are going to be two Germanies as long as the Soviet
                        Union believes that that is in her interest. The problem now is to make sure
                        that, in any treaty which the Soviet Union reaches with East Germany, the
                        rights of the other powers are recognized in Berlin. That's all we're
                        talking about. We are not talking about encouraging revanchism, building a
                        great German military machine, or anything else you mention. In any peace
                        treaty which is signed with East Germany, there must be a recognition of the
                        rights of the United States and the other powers.</p>
                    <p>Now that does not seem to me to be a threat in any way to the security of the
                        Soviet Union. That does not provide for any increase in the Western military
                        forces, which are rather limited there. I think we could have peace in this
                        century in Central Europe if we can reach an accord over West Berlin. To
                        pursue another course in the name of ending World War II—a course which
                        threatens to increase the chance of World War III—represents a wholly unwise
                        policy, for you and for us.</p>
                    <p>So, if I were a Soviet officer and wanted peace, I would think peace can be
                        won and my country's security can be assured. The Soviet Union is a strong
                        military power. It has great nuclear capacity. It has missiles, planes—it
                        has a great number of divisions—it has countries associated with it. No one
                        is ever going to invade the Soviet Union again. There is no military power
                        that can do that. The problem is to make an agreement which will permit us
                        to have our interests recognized, as well as yours. That should not be
                        beyond the capacity of us both.</p>
                    <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did not, nor did
                        I, make the arrangements in 1945 in regard to Berlin. Our responsibility,
                        given the situation which is a difficult one, is to bring about peace, and I
                        believe it can be done.</p>
                    <p>In short, if I were a Soviet naval officer, I would feel that the security of
                        the Soviet Union was well protected, and that the important thing now is to
                        reach an accord with the United States, our ally during that second war.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>: Mr. President, I am
                        about to finish. Of course, you answered this question not as a veteran of
                        the Soviet armed forces but as President of the United States, and that is
                        quite natural. However, as I understand you, Mr. President, you are against
                        West Germany's having nuclear weapons at her disposal, or in any degree of
                        control over such weapons?</p>
                    <p>The President. The United States, as a matter of national policy, as I said
                        at the United Nations, will not give nuclear weapons to any country, and I
                        would be extremely reluctant to see West Germany acquire a nuclear capacity
                        of its own. Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> stated
                        that they would <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0361"/>not, in 1954.<note n="9" xml:id="d134fn9">For text of Protocol III to the Brussels Treaty,
                            October 22, 1954, in which <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> made this undertaking, see <ref target="frus1952-54v05p2">

                                pp. 1446-1451</ref>.</note> That is still the policy of that
                        government, and I think that is the wise policy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>: But you know perfectly
                        well that many top posts in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> are
                        occupied by German generals, and you know that Europe is very far from the
                        United States. Don't you think that at some point it might happen that
                        German generals might become too influential in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>?</p>
                    <p>The President. That is why I believe it to be so important to stress the West
                        German army is integrated in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is now commanded by an American; and, in
                        my judgment, as long as German forces are integrated in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>—and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        is under the control of the 15 <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        countries, none of which wants another war—there is security for all. And I
                        think that will continue.</p>
                    <p>Now if this situation changed, if Germany developed an atomic capability of
                        its own, if it developed many missiles, or a strong national army that
                        threatened war, then I would understand your concern, and I would share it.
                        After all, we have had two wars in Europe, as well as you. But the situation
                        today, and the situation for the future, is as I have described it. If it
                        changed, then it would seem to me appropriate for the United States and the
                        Soviet Union and others to consider the situation at that time. But it is
                        not that way now, so why take the risk of having the United States, which is
                        a powerful country, and the Soviet Union, which is also powerful, getting
                        into difficulty with each other, when there is no real threat in Europe to
                        you or to us. I think that we should look at things as they are in 1961.</p>
                    <p>You have stated that you are realists. This is not 1939, 1940, or 1941. Look
                        what has happened. As I said, in the Far East, Japan's strength was entirely
                        different in those years. China's power was also entirely different.
                        Countries change. Situations change. And we have to be realistic enough to
                        see where the real danger lies. The real danger today is the fact that both
                        of us possess in our nuclear stockpiles the means to impose great
                        devastation upon each other—and we are the ones that have the most to lose
                        from war.</p>
                    <p>Therefore I think, if we look at it realistically, we should be able to reach
                        an accord which protects the interests of our two great countries, and
                        permits us both to go ahead with increasing our standard of living and
                        meeting other problems. In the United States in the last 14 years our living
                        standard has increased 40 percent. In the Soviet Union it has gone up
                        sharply. Nobody can benefit more from peace than the Soviet Union and the
                        United States.</p>
                    <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0362"/>
                    <p>I would hope that rather than attempting to talk about conditions in Germany
                        as they were 20 years ago, we would look at them as they are today. We have
                        had peace, really, in Europe for 15 years. The problem now is to see if we
                        can reach a negotiation which can settle this matter for another 15 years.
                        Nobody knows what is going to happen in the world over the long run, but at
                        least we ought to be able to settle this matter of Berlin and Germany.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>: I thank you for your
                        attention and this time that I took from your weekend rest.</p>
                    <p>The President. I appreciate very much your giving me, as President, this
                        opportunity to talk to the people of the Soviet Union, and your courtesy in
                        coming here. I want to emphasize that to the people of this country there is
                        nothing that would satisfy them more than to see the two countries live at
                        peace, and the people of the two countries enjoying a steadily increasing
                        standard of living. I was in the Soviet Union as a student in 1939, and I
                        understand that there have been many changes, and that the standard of
                        living of the people is rising. The standards of the people of the United
                        States have also risen. I am hopeful that this interview will contribute in
                        some degree to better understanding and to peace. For, I repeat again, our
                        two peoples have the most to gain from peace.</p>

                    <p>“Dear Alexsei:</p>
                    <p>“We were all most pleased with the publication of the President's interview
                        in <hi rend="italic">Izvestia.</hi> As I told you when you were here, I
                        considered the opportunity for an American President to express his views to
                        the Soviet people of the greatest possible importance and your faithful
                        publication of the President's views has fully met our expectations in this
                        matter.</p>
                    <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0363"/>
                    <p>“As you said in the interview, it is sometimes better to ‘begin with small
                        things.’ The interview, in my opinion, was a ‘big thing’ but there are other
                        matters relating to free communication between our two countries which, in
                        my mind, can be improved.</p>
                    <p>“As you will recall during our first meeting last June, we spent some time on
                        the problem of the restrictions on American and Soviet newsmen in our
                        respective countries. I do not believe these restrictions to be in the
                        interest of either the United States or the Soviet Union. We discussed the
                        same subject again last week in Hyannis and you expressed the belief that
                        should the United States decide to lift its restrictions on Soviet newsmen,
                        the Soviet Union would do likewise with regard to American newsmen. I refer
                        specifically to the travel restrictions which have been imposed by our
                        respective countries.</p>
                    <p>“I would like to reiterate that should the Soviet government agree to lift
                        such travel restrictions on American newsmen, we are prepared to do the same
                        for Soviet newsmen, on a simultaneous basis. I believe if we were to do this
                        in the very nearest future it could be pointed out as another indication of
                        a lessening of tension between the United States and the Soviet Union as
                        well as the opening up of free communication between our two peoples. I have
                        always felt that this was of the greatest possible importance.</p>
                    <p>“I would appreciate your using your influence in bringing about this
                        agreement. I shall hold this communication in confidence until you have time
                        to reply to it.<note n="2" xml:id="d135fn2">The following day <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> sent <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName> a memorandum stating that <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> felt the draft letter would be most

                            that <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName>'s letter was the
                            right medium to raise the question of lifting restrictions on newsmen.

                    <p>The new Soviet proposal for a simple four-point test ban agreement,<note n="2" xml:id="d136fn2">November 28; for text, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1961</hi>, p. 664.</note> containing
                        provisions which the Soviets have long known were unacceptable to the West,
                        underscores the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s intention to use the
                        Geneva talks as a propaganda forum for denouncing the continuation of
                        Western testing, particularly any US decision to undertake atmospheric
                        tests. Moscow hopes to use the talks to repair the damage done to its image
                        abroad by the long Soviet test series. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s “new approach” is also intended to divert the
                        discussions from previous Soviet obstructive demands such as the “troika”
                        scheme in the control system and to exploit the US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> rejection of a new uncontrolled moratorium on testing during
                        the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>In a move designed to appear responsive to the Western position, the Soviet
                        statement of 27 November<note n="3" xml:id="d136fn3">For text, see ibid.,
                            pp. 659-663.</note> recalled the 3 September proposal by President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> for a ban on atmospheric
                        testing, relying on existing means of detection, and proposed that this ban
                        be extended to include outer space and underwater tests. On the crucial and
                        unresolved issue of underground tests, Moscow proposed a moratorium pending
                        agreement on a control system which would be a “composite part” of an
                        international system to supervise a general disarmament agreement.</p>
                    <p>This new approach raised the possibility that the Soviet Union, despite
                        Khrushchev's 10 September rejection of the US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> proposal when the Soviet test series was just getting under
                        way, may eventually propose that this Western proposal be adopted as the
                        basis for an immediate agreement banning atmospheric tests. The Soviets may
                        calculate that such a maneuver could inhibit the US from undertaking
                        atmospheric tests and place the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> on
                        the defensive in the talks.</p>
                    <p>A member of the Soviet delegation, in a conversation with a US delegate on 28
                        November, feigned surprise over the negative Western reaction to the new
                        Soviet proposal and argued that the Soviet plan in essence went no further
                        than the Western offer to ban atmospheric tests with monitoring left to
                        existing national detection systems. The Soviet representative said the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would “emphasize” that the West's
                        negative reaction represents a retreat from the 3 September proposal and
                        insisted that world opinion would not understand this “switch” in
                        position.</p>

                    <p>A <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> report on the 28 November session of
                        the test ban talks said that the Soviet proposals were rejected by the
                        Western representatives “without even bothering to study them.” The report
                        claimed that from the start the Western delegates displayed intractability
                        and insisted on their old positions, while US delegate <persName corresp="#p_DAH1">Dean</persName> said that the Western powers would not
                        halt nuclear tests. Soviet delegate <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> told newsmen after the session that he was “not
                        very happy” about the Western reaction to the Soviet proposals but commented
                        that “after careful study of our proposals, after consideration of our new
                        approach, the West could easily come to an agreement on this basis.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> also said that the
                        Soviet Union would not negotiate on the basis of “the ancient treaty
                        proposed by the West.”</p>
                    <p>Moscow's current proposal for the first time includes a demand for French
                        participation in the talks and adherence to the agreement, although Moscow
                        began warning last March that French testing while the talks were in
                        progress could make the talks pointless. One of reasons <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> advanced for his 10 September
                        rejection of the US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> proposal to ban
                        atmospheric tests was its failure to include France. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would not tolerate such an “impermissible
                        situation.”</p>
                    <p>During the 28 November session <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> repeated the call for French participation but
                        without making continuation of the talks dependent on fulfillment of this
                        demand. His failure to do so and his mild comment that a pledge to refrain
                        from testing would “facilitate” negotiations suggest that the Soviets are
                        preparing for a long stay at Geneva and will try to place the onus for any
                        breakoff of the talks on the Western powers. A Soviet delegate has already
                        expressed “hope” that the Western delegations would follow the custom of
                        proposing a Christmas recess.</p>
                    <p>By coming out in favor of an immediate ban on all tests, the Soviet leaders
                        probably hope to convince neutral opinion that the Western desire for
                        further tests is the main obstacle to an early agreement. In this connection
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> explicitly stated in a
                        recent letter to the president of the World Peace Council that if the
                        Western powers conduct tests, “we too shall be obliged to return to them in
                        order to keep our armed forces at the modern level.” In an obvious attempt
                        to attract neutralist support for the “new approach,” the Soviet Foreign
                        Ministry immediately passed copies of its latest proposals to the
                        ambassadors of neutral countries. The 21 November Soviet note<note n="4" xml:id="d136fn4">For text, see ibid., pp. 635-636.</note> agreeing to
                        return to the Geneva talks had similarly been distributed promptly to
                        neutralist representatives.</p>
                    <p>The draft treaty was released by the Soviets on 27 November, the day before
                        the Geneva test ban talks resumed after a recess of almost <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0366"/>three months. It marks a further shift from
                        the position taken by Moscow that a test ban agreement could be considered
                        only as part of an agreement on complete and general disarmament. Whereas
                        last spring and summer the Soviet delegation in Geneva insisted that a ban
                        on tests apart from general disarmament would be unacceptable unless the
                        Western powers accepted the “troika” principle for controlling a test
                        agreement, the new Soviet proposal avoids the controversial control issues
                        and pays only lip service to a general disarmament agreement.</p>
                    <p>The plan in effect calls for a separate, uncontrolled ban on all tests and is
                        a reversion to the position taken in early 1960, when the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> made a similar proposal for a permanent
                        ban on all tests except small underground explosions, which would have been
                        covered by a voluntary moratorium. That proposal was eventually modified to
                        link the duration of the moratorium to a research program to improve
                        detection and identification techniques; the current plan, however, would
                        extend the moratorium on underground tests until agreement could be reached
                        on a system of controls for such tests, which would form part of an
                        international control system for general disarmament. In this way Moscow
                        would avoid submitting to a system of foreign inspection, which it had
                        earlier claimed was far too extensive for an agreement limited in scope.
                        Moscow would also avoid having to defend the “troika” plan, which it
                        contends would not be necessary under general disarmament.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet statement accompanying the new draft treaty asserts that it
                        represents a “new approach” and is intended to “direct” the Geneva talks
                        into a “practical current” in order to exclude the “difficulties and
                        obstacles which stood in the way of an agreement in the past.” This line
                        suggests that in the face of widespread criticism of Soviet testing, the
                        Soviet leaders probably felt they could not afford to stand on either of
                        their previous positions of linking a test treaty to agreement on general
                        and complete disarmament, or demanding a “troika” system for controls. The
                        proposal indicates, however, that no international controls over a test ban
                        agreement would be implemented until a disarmament agreement was reached.

                    </list>
                    <p>During my recent consultation in the Department when discussing the possible
                        inclusion of exchanges between the Congress and the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet
                        I was informed that the Congress was opposed to any exchange of delegations.
                        I was therefore somewhat surprised to receive a copy of a letter from
                        Assistant Secretary Hays to the Vice President dated October 3, 1961<note n="2" xml:id="d137fn2">Not found.</note> requesting the opinion of the
                        Vice President on this problem. The Assistant Secretary's letter itself
                        expressed the Department's opposition to any formal exchange.</p>
                    <p>As the Department is aware, the Soviet authorities went out of their way to
                        treat Senator Javits as a tourist and to refuse him interviews with higher
                        Soviet officials connected with foreign trade, which was the specific sphere
                        in which he was interested.<note n="3" xml:id="d137fn3">Senator Jacob K.
                            Javits of New York had visited the Soviet Union for the last 9 days of
                            November. Documentation on his visit including a memorandum of his
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName>,
                            referred to below, is in Department of State, Central Files,
                            033.1100-JA. Senator Allen J. Ellender of Louisiana also visited the
                            Soviet Union for 7 weeks beginning October 2. For his report on the
                            visit, see U.S. Foreign Policy and Operations; additional documentation
                            on his visit, including memoranda of his conversations with various
                            Soviet officials, is in Department of State, Central File,
                            033.1100-EL.</note> Congressional visits have always been a problem for
                        the Embassy. While according to the Department's instructions the Embassy is
                        absolved from making arrangements for interviews of congressmen visiting the
                        Soviet Union as tourists, in practice it is clearly impracticable for the
                        Embassy to refuse its assistance to such congressional visitors. While these
                        have not been numerous in the past year, I believe it can be anticipated
                        that such visits will be more numerous in the future. I am thoroughly in
                        agreement with the Department in insisting upon control over the actual
                        arrangements for visits from members of the Supreme Soviet remaining in the
                        hands of the Department. I believe that Senator Javits had considerable
                        success in explaining to the Soviet officials concerned, in particular Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> of the State Committee
                        for Cultural Relations With Foreign Countries, that the Congress does not
                        have the function nor the facilities to handle the details of such visits.
                        On the other hand I believe it would be to the interest of both the
                        Department and the Embassy if some better system of handling <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0368"/>congressional visits could be arranged.
                        While I do not wish to push unduly my point of view as we can of course live
                        with the present system, I believe Senator Javits' experience justifies a
                        re-examination of this question. In my opinion an official exchange of
                        delegations between the Congress and the Supreme Soviet would be to the
                        advantage of the United States. It is to our interest to encourage visits
                        from Soviet officials who play an important role in their country. Although
                        the Supreme Soviet is gradually growing somewhat in importance it is of
                        course basically a rubber-stamp organization, the chief purpose of which is
                        to enable the Soviet leadership to advocate its current policies to a cross
                        section of its own officials. Nevertheless the members of the Supreme Soviet
                        do play an important role in their own communities and are people who could
                        be influenced by a visit to the United States. I am not impressed by the
                        argument that a formal exchange of visits would tend to equate the
                        undemocratic Supreme Soviet with the freely-elected Congress, since the
                        character of the two organizations appears already to be widely known.</p>
                    <p>Even if a formal exchange of delegations is not agreed to by the Department,
                        I believe it would be useful if the Congress could be persuaded to make some
                        arrangements to coordinate visits of congressmen to the U.S.S.R. If this is
                        not done it is quite likely that we will have separate visits from a number
                        of congressmen interested in the same subject, and the Soviet authorities
                        cannot be expected to make satisfactory arrangements for a number of
                        individuals investigating the same field. A large number of requests to the
                        Soviet authorities for assistance in arranging congressional visits in a
                        given field, for example education, could also interfere with arrangements
                        for specialized delegations in such field. Moreover, as matters now stand
                        the Soviet authorities can give preference to congressmen whom they believe
                        will give more favorable publicity to conditions in the Soviet Union rather
                        than to congressmen who are likely to be more critical. If the Congress
                        itself would set up some means of coordination it seems probable that
                        balanced delegations would be formed which would avoid this difficulty.</p>

                        nuclear weapons in the atmosphere to the Berlin issue. According to the

                        affirmative. If a really good settlement could be achieved on Berlin, he
                        believed—as a private matter, not for publication—that it would be easier to

                        described in his covering memorandum as “a really powerful paper arguing for

                        have had for some time that you have a right to hear a better argument
                        against testing now than you have yet heard from advisers nearly all of whom

                        “really of high importance” and capsulized as follows: “1. You can safely
                        offer an atmospheric test-ban, because without atmospheric tests we can be
                        sure of a nuclear stand-off, and even with them we cannot get anything
                        better after 1963. 2. If Russians accept, you get a real step towards arms
                        control. 3. If Russians reject, you shift much of the weight of our test

                    <p>You may recall that on November 24, 1961 you sent a letter to the Attorney
                        General (Tab A) setting forth the Department's position on a possible
                        Powers-Abel exchange.<note n="2" xml:id="d141fn2">Not printed. In this
                            letter <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> wrote:</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>“I do not believe that foreign policy considerations as such need be a factor
                        influencing the Justice determination in consultation with the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> as to whether we should proceed in an
                        attempt to obtain the release of Powers in exchange for the release of
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARI1">Abel</persName>.”</p>
                    <p>This matter has been discussed on several occasions by representatives of the
                        Department and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> with Mr. Oehmann, Special
                        Assistant to the Attorney General. The various facets of the problem have
                        been carefully explored, including whether, if an exchange is agreeable from
                        the standpoint of Justice, we should try to get more than Powers for Abel,
                        i.e., whether we should try to get a package including some or all of those
                        mentioned below. While there are of course Americans held in various bloc
                        countries (Communist China, North Vietnam, etc.), for practical purposes it
                        seemed logical to limit any potential “package” to the following:</p>
                    <p>(1) Marvin Makinen, a 23 year old American student in Berlin who was arrested
                        in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> this July. He was sentenced in
                        September, 1961, <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0372"/>to eight years for
                        espionage and is in prison in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. A
                        moderate amount of interest and pressure on the Department has developed
                        from Makinen's family and friends.</p>
                    <p>(2) Frederick Pryor, a 28 year old student in Berlin working on a Ph.D.
                        dissertation on “Communist Foreign Trade”. He made many contacts in East
                        Germany, including some with persons in ill favor with the <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> regime. He was arrested August 25
                        and detained apparently on espionage grounds. A show trial is expected in
                        January. His parents have been very active on his behalf, including an
                        extended stay in Berlin. They have received a letter from “Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_ARI1">Abel</persName>” proposing an exchange. The family
                        knows nothing of the status of the Donovan-Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_ARI1">Abel</persName> channel and believe they may play a leading role in a
                        possible exchange.</p>
                    <p>(3) Victor Pankey-Gilbert Ferrey, the two college boys who were caught trying
                        to smuggle a girl from East to West Berlin, and were sentenced to two years.
                        A moderate amount of pressure and interest has been exerted through family
                        and Congressional sources.</p>
                    <p>The possibility of a “peel off” negotiation has also been considered, i.e.,
                        ask for a 5 for 1 deal, then, if this is not acceptable, drop our asking
                        price in stages down to a straight man for man exchange.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has presented a strong position favoring
                        a direct Powers-<persName corresp="#p_ARI1">Abel</persName> exchange,
                        believing that attempting to get a 5 for 1 or other combination “package”
                        might complicate the effort to extricate Powers. Their evaluation of the
                        importance of obtaining Powers' release has increased since their memorandum
                        on the subject was prepared in November (Tab B).<note n="3" xml:id="d141fn3">Not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The probable adverse reaction from the families and others interested in the
                        individuals held by the Communists to a straight Powers-<persName corresp="#p_ARI1">Abel</persName> exchange was discussed at the
                        Department of Justice and, we understand, was brought specifically to the
                        attention of the Attorney General.</p>
                    <p>The Department has now been informed that the Attorney General has
                        decided:</p>
                    <p>1) that he will agree to a Powers-<persName corresp="#p_ARI1">Abel</persName>
                        exchange;</p>
                    <p>2) that he will envisage an arrangement other than that previously

                    <p>3) that he favors a direct <persName corresp="#p_ARI1">Abel</persName>-Powers
                        exchange, with no “strays” rung in, which he believes would create
                        complications which might ruin the operation.</p>
                    <p>An additional factor of significance relating both to the scope of the
                        exchange as well as public reaction is that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has developed a detailed plan for handling Powers should he
                        be released. They would like to undertake a secret operation under which the
                        release would not be disclosed for a considerable period of time and Powers
                        would in effect be <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0373"/>kept “under
                        wraps” while he is debriefed and his future activities arranged.</p>
                    <p>Some thought has been given to the technique of a possible approach to the
                        Soviets. Preliminary judgment in the Department of Justice, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and the Department favors using James
                        Donovan, <persName corresp="#p_ARI1">Abel</persName>'s New York lawyer for
                        this purpose. The most recent letter from Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_ARI1">Abel</persName> to him<note n="4" xml:id="d141fn4">Not printed, but
                            most of this letter is published in Donovan, Strangers on a Bridge, pp.
                            367-368.</note> has remained unanswered while the decision of the
                        Attorney General on its wording was awaited. It is now believed preferable
                        to consider having Donovan go to Germany to establish direct contact with
                        Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_ARI1">Abel</persName> and her Soviet contacts and
                        seek to make arrangements. Donovan is highly regarded by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> for this role as he has cooperated closely
                        with the Government in all matters relating to the correspondence with Mrs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARI1">Abel</persName> and also has the advantage
                        of apparently having achieved considerable respect from the communist side
                        as a result of his spirited and able defense of <persName corresp="#p_ARI1">Abel</persName>. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has sounded him
                        out in the past few days and ascertained that he is prepared to act as
                        intermediary. It is envisaged that if it is now agreed that he will be so
                        designated he will be requested to come to Washington very soon for a
                        careful briefing.<note n="5" xml:id="d141fn5">Presumably the meeting
                            discussed ibid., pp. 371-372.</note>
                        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> will finance the effort.</p>
                    <p>The principal aspect which we believe should be called to your attention
                        relates to the “package-no package” decision. We thought that if for any
                        reason you believe an effort should be made to arrange a “package” exchange
                        for <persName corresp="#p_ARI1">Abel</persName>, that you might wish to
                        discuss the matter personally with the Attorney General and perhaps Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>. The chief advantage of a
                        package deal, as we see it, is that it would give the Administration a
                        better position vis-à-vis the families, possible Congressional inquiries,
                        and the public.</p>
                    <p>If you agree that proceeding on a direct <persName corresp="#p_ARI1">Abel</persName>-Powers exchange is appropriate in view of the
                        circumstances, so that State-Justice-<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                        concurrence exists on the point, we will continue our separate efforts to
                        secure the release of the other Americans mentioned above. We also have
                        asked <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to check whether the West Germans
                        are holding any East German or Soviet agents who might be “borrowed” as
                        possible trading material for Pryor and possibly Ferrey and Pankey.</p>

                    <p>DEAR GEORGE: Your letter of December 26<note n="2" xml:id="d142fn2">For text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v14">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1961-1963, vol. XIV, pp.
                                705-708</ref>.</note> just arrived and I am very glad to have your
                        views. Actually I do not think that our opinions are very far apart. I was
                        somewhat concerned at some of the statements in your telegram<note n="3" xml:id="d142fn3">Regarding this telegram and the one referred to below,
                            see ibid., footnote 1, p. 705.</note> for the effect they might have on
                        policy. Although your telegram was presumably marked Eyes Only I would
                        assume it was read by at least the top Pentagon officials and I note that
                        the President in a recent conversation, I think with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, said that you thought the Soviets
                        were preparing to go to war while I disagreed. What disturbed me was the
                        possibility that this might encourage advocates of surprise attack,
                        particularly if and when we have a trial of nerves over the Berlin question
                        as seems almost inevitable. As you will note from my telegram, I do think
                        the Soviets will bring us very close to war and in fact have already done
                        so. It is therefore natural that the Soviet military would insist upon
                        having the resources they consider necessary if anything should go wrong.
                        There are a good many signs that the military do exercise influence on the
                        leadership, although I think this is confined to purely military matters. I
                        think the Soviet military must have told <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that policy on the Berlin question was up to the
                        Presidium but that since this involved a real risk of military conflict and
                        since it had already generated extensive military measures on the part of
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and particularly the U.S., they
                        must insist upon adequate steps being taken to enable them to carry out
                        their responsibilities. I think this was the primary reason for the
                        resumption of testing although I suspect another factor was Soviet
                        realization that the Chinese Communists would not in any case go along with
                        a controlled test ban. I also think that there is a division of opinion
                        within <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0375"/>the Soviet military
                        establishment. I do not have much to base this on, but whenever there has
                        been a real crisis in relations with us, including the U-2, some of the
                        Soviet Marshals have gone out of their way conspicuously to be pleasant to
                        me. As you know, actions of this kind are seldom coincidence here.</p>
                    <p>I quite agree that on the German problem we have at the moment little to
                        offer and I suspect that in the end the best we will get is some arrangement
                        after their signature of a separate treaty to keep East German interference
                        within the limits of our tolerance, but this will be a most unsatisfactory
                        situation. This seems a pity since after the Berlin wall was built it should
                        have been possible for us to have produced a proposal which would have
                        provided the Soviets with a real alternative to the risky course they will
                        probably follow. The situation is not, however, quite as bad as it appears
                        because if we find that the Soviets would give us some real improvement on
                        access which would have a genuine promise of durability we could go much
                        further with our allies than we have been able to do on an abstract basis.
                        The difficulty here of course is that the Soviets will almost never reveal
                        their side of a bargain first. With so many strings and so many kibitzers my
                        task appears almost hopeless but I intend to give it a real try.</p>
                    <p>This is a most interesting period here and although people are beginning to
                        talk much more freely, it is frustrating not to know what is really going
                        on. There is no doubt that there have been very sharp differences on policy
                        within the leadership. Some of these are set forth in Research Memorandum
                            <gloss target="#t_RSB1">RSB</gloss>-35, December 11, 1961,<note n="4" xml:id="d142fn4">Not printed. (Department of State, Central Files,

                        Research. The <gloss target="#t_FBIS1">FBIS</gloss> made an excellent study
                        documenting the thesis that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was obliged to retreat from his advocacy of
                        greater allocation to non-agricultural consumers goods. You may also have
                        read Conquest's book on the leadership<note n="5" xml:id="d142fn5"> Robert
                            Conquest, <hi rend="italic">Power and Policy in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>: The Study of Soviet
                                Dynasties,</hi> New York, 1961.</note> and his thesis (which the
                        Department inclines to accept and which I much doubt) that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wanted to punish the anti-Party
                        group more than he was able to do because of opposition within the Party.
                        While I am convinced that many of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s policies meet vigorous criticism and even
                        opposition, I do not think this takes the form of any attempt to supplant
                        him. Another development which will bear watching is the growing influence
                        of the new generation. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> on
                        New Year's Eve asked me to call the President's attention to the fact that
                        the new Soviet Ambassador to Washington was a member of “their generation.”
                        He is, incidentally, an excellent man and I consider that his appointment
                        and that of Soldatov to London are all to the good.</p>
                    <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0376"/>
                    <p>I should be more than delighted if you would visit Moscow and hope that you
                        would bring Annelise and of course would expect you to stay with us. I
                        expect to leave in the spring and it could be that I might leave earlier if
                        there is some definite turn in the Berlin problem. When I asked the
                        Secretary some months ago what my chances of getting away from here were, he
                        replied that I was in the same category as Bizerte. I think that despite the
                        indications from the Soviets that they would not object to a visit, it would
                        be well either for you through the Soviet Embassy or for me here informally
                        to sound out the Soviets before making an actual application for a visa. I
                        think they would appreciate the courtesy of having an opportunity informally
                        to suggest a change in timing if there should be some subject such as
                        Soviet-Yugoslav relations, the Albanian question, or even internal policy
                        toward Soviet intellectuals on the carpet at the time you planned your
                        visit.</p>
                    <p>I gather that the intellectuals, along with other groups, are currently
                        probing to see how far they can go following the 22nd Congress. Given the
                        Russian character it is quite likely that they will go too far and have to
                        be checkreined.</p>
                    <p>I will be most interested in your reactions to the current Soviet scene. I
                        think you will be startled in two ways: to find how much some things are
                        exactly the same while others have completely changed. Internally I believe
                        the regime is approaching a crossroads and the outcome of the Berlin problem
                        may have great influence on which path they take.</p>
                    <p>Jane joins me in best wishes to you both. We envy you the skiing which we had
                        also planned but as usual the Department decided otherwise.</p>

                    <p>On January 17, 1962, the intelligence community issued Special National
                        Intelligence Estimate 80-62, which sought to estimate the threat to U.S.
                        security interests in the Caribbean area over the next two decades. <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0377"/>Regarding the possible
                        establishment of a hostile military presence, the estimate stated the
                        following: “Cuba and any other Caribbean state which fell under Communist
                        control could be used by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as areas
                        in which to establish missile, submarine, or air bases, designed to bring
                        North America under attack or to add to the deterrents to any conceivable US
                        military action in the Caribbean or elsewhere. On the whole, we believe the
                        establishment of such Soviet bases is unlikely for some time to come. Their
                        military and psychological value, in Soviet eyes, would probably not be
                        great enough to override the risks involved.” For text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v10">

                    <p>3. In <gloss target="#t_FONOFF1">FonOff</gloss> view these developments
                        should be assessed against the following problems currently confronting
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>: (a) delay in
                        effecting Berlin settlement in accordance with his November 1958 ultimatum;
                        (b) his difficulties with China and Albania and consequent repercussions in
                        bloc; (c) his recognition of growing Western confidence in USA in light of
                        U.S. reappraisal of military balance between East and West.</p>
                    <p>4. <gloss target="#t_FONOFF1">FonOff</gloss> assumes that Soviets are in
                        process of reconsideration their policies with regard to three issues cited
                        above. Although it points out Soviet leaders give no impression of being in
                        state of crisis with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        travelling around Byelorussia and Mikoyan off in Africa.</p>
                    <p>5. As to effect of such re-examination on Soviet actions and implications it
                        may hold for West, <gloss target="#t_FONOFF1">FonOff</gloss>'s crystal ball
                        is somewhat cloudy. In <gloss target="#t_FONOFF1">FonOff</gloss> view, it is
                        difficult to see what easy solutions <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> can find on either Berlin or his difficulties
                        with Albania or China. He may even contemplate stalling on these while
                        focusing on this third problem—the military balance. He may contemplate
                        distractions elsewhere making the most of opportunities such as exploiting
                        the anti-colonial gale blowing through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        and coming forward with plausible schemes of disengagement and international
                        security. While Berlin may be put on back burner, <gloss target="#t_FONOFF1">FonOff</gloss> continues believe that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will use any suitable occasion for harassments
                        over access to Berlin although avoiding action which might risk hostilities
                        however limited.</p>
                    <p>In discussing above assessment with Embassy <gloss target="#t_FONOFF1">FonOff</gloss> stressed preliminary and informal nature of its views
                        and expressed interest in being informed of Dept's current appraisal of
                        recent rather puzzling developments and particularly if appropriate of
                        substance of Secretary's remarks <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0379"/>to
                        Senate Foreign Relations Committee which had been widely reported in local
                            press.<note n="7" xml:id="d144fn7">On January 22 <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> reported that the British
                            analysis seemed “generally sound,” but added that the Soviets had
                            exchanged New Year's messages with <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> (paragraph 2c) and the problems of agriculture
                            and dimmer prospects in Africa might be added to paragraph 3. He
                            concluded that while there were “undoubtedly disputes within Soviet
                            leadership over several current policies, I do not see in this any
                            indication of a real power struggle for leadership within Soviet party
                            itself.” (Telegram 2008 from Moscow; Department of State, Central Files,

                    <p>DEAR SENATOR KEATING: I have your communication of January 11<note n="2" xml:id="d145fn2">Not printed, but attached to the source text.</note> in
                        which you inquire concerning student exchanges between the United States and
                        the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The U.S.-U.S.S.R. Exchanges Agreements of January 28, 1958 and November 21,
                            1959<note n="3" xml:id="d145fn3">For text of the 1958 agreement, see 9
                            UST 13; for text of the 1959 agreement, see 10 UST 1934.</note> have
                        provided for exchange of graduate students between the United States and the
                        Soviet Union. This exchange, like the other exchanges provided by the
                        Agreements, is governed by the principle of reciprocity so that Soviet
                        graduate students are received only on the basis that a similar number of
                        American graduate students are received in the Soviet Union under similar
                        conditions. During the current academic year, thirty-six Soviet graduate
                        students are enrolled in American universities while thirty-seven American
                        graduate students have been accepted in Soviet institutions.</p>
                    <p>The exchange program with the Soviet Union, as you undoubtedly know, is
                        carried out under the provisions of National Security Council <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0380"/>directives. Individual exchanges including
                        the graduate student exchange, as well as the program as a whole, are under
                        continuing evaluation to insure that they are in the national interest. We
                        do not feel that the small number of Soviet students involved will deprive
                        any American students of places in our universities, particularly since they
                        are enrolled in special programs at the graduate level. In any case, we
                        believe that the advantages of having a carefully selected group of mature
                        American graduate students, with a good command of the Russian language,
                        enrolled in Soviet universities more than compensates for any disadvantages
                        in having Soviet students in the United States. No other group of American
                        citizens is in a position to come into such close contact with everyday life
                        in the Soviet Union and particularly with an important segment of Soviet
                        society. We consider there are also some advantages in exposing a limited
                        number of future Soviet intellectuals and scientific leaders to life in the
                        United States. Appropriate measures are taken to see that their presence in
                        the United States does not constitute a serious security hazard.</p>
                    <p>The report in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> of January 2 that the
                        United States and the Soviet Union have permitted the Exchanges Agreement to
                        lapse, may be misleading. The November 21, 1959 Agreement provided for
                        exchanges during the years 1960-1961, a period which is now concluded. It is
                        possible that there will be negotiations on a new exchanges agreement to
                        provide for exchanges during the years 1962-1963 within the next month or
                        two, and preliminary drafts have already been exchanged. In the meantime,
                        those portions of the last Agreement that govern continuing or recurring
                        programs, such as the graduate student exchange, are considered to be still
                        in effect.</p>
                    <p>If we can be of further assistance please do not hesitate to let us know.</p>

                    <p>DEAR CHIP: I note in today's radio bulletin that the President has invited
                            <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> to lunch. This raises
                        some questions in my mind. I must admit that his interview with the
                            President<note n="2" xml:id="d146fn2">See <ref target="#d134">Document
                                134</ref>.</note> was a ten-strike for us. This subsequent
                        invitation however makes me wonder if it is really a good idea to build him
                        up as much as we are doing. He is a forceful young man and is endeavoring to
                        encourage young Communists to play a greater role in life here, which is all
                        to the good. On the other hand, I believe that he is personally very
                        anti-American and he is certainly a ruthless careerist. While I understand
                        that the workers on his paper think that he is doing a useful service to
                        Soviet journalism by introducing new practices, I do not think that he is
                        personally respected and he has undoubtedly made many enemies. I doubt very
                        much that he will survive them if anything happens to his father-in-law.
                        Another point that bothers me is that <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>'s paper has been running almost daily for some
                        months vicious anti-American articles and cartoons.<note n="3" xml:id="d146fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> had also made these
                            points in telegram 2038 from Moscow, January 25. (Department of State,
                            Central Files, 911.6261/1-2561)</note> I don't like to see him rewarded
                        for this type of thing. I would therefore dislike to see us get too tied to
                        him, although this is of course a good way for the President to get thoughts
                        to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. I have no feeling
                        whatever about my personal position in this, for as you know I can easily
                        see <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> at any time. I do
                        think however that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would
                        like to undercut and diminish the role of the Secretary. While this is
                        doubtless recognized and need not cause us concern, it doesn't seem wise to
                        encourage the Soviets in the idea that they can do this. You may wish to

                        Department generally agrees with British analysis Soviet developments,

                    <p>Our crystal ball no less cloudy than British. We inclined believe, however,
                        there less question of serious split in Soviet leadership than indecision
                        among leaders, including <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>,
                        over policies to follow. Closely related factor is magnitude and number of
                        inter-related problems requiring decision. As both <gloss target="#t_FONOFF1">FonOff</gloss> and Embassy Moscow point out,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> trips strongly indicate absence of
                        leadership crisis. These trips do indicate, however, seriousness with which

                            (<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> tours) and relations
                        with African states, especially following apparent difficulties in Guinea
                            (<hi rend="italic">Mikoyan</hi> trip). We also inclined believe that at
                        least until other problems are partially back on rails Soviets wish let

                    <p>On January 28, 1962, Assistant Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> called in Soviet Charge Smirnovsky. Talking
                        informally from an oral statement, <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> informed him that the United States supported the
                        agreement reached in Geneva on January 19 among the three Laotian factions
                        and <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0383"/>hoped the upcoming meeting of
                        the three factions in Laos would enable them to form a government and send a
                        united delegation to the conference in Geneva. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> then noted that the United States might be forced
                        to increase pressure on Royal Lao Government leaders to “induce them to
                        negotiate in good faith and not to obstruct settlement by unreasonable
                        demands.” Since such pressures might include withholding aid, which could
                        weaken the Royal Lao Government politically and militarily, the United
                        States would “need assurances from Soviet Gov't that they will see to it
                        that P[athet] L[ao] do not take advantage of the situation.” For text of

                        not be expected to pressure the Royal Lao Government when it was under
                        leftist military attack. (Ibid., page 611, footnote 1) In telegram 2109 to

                        therefore, as essentially to impress on Soviets that rigid maintenance of
                        their present position will prevent agreement but that some flexibility on
                        their part may provide basis for progress.” For text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v14">

                    <p>In telegram 2100 to the Department of State, February 1, <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> reported back on his meeting with

                        stated, by the fact that the proposals presented by the U.S. were “not at
                        all realistic and Soviet attitude toward them is well-known.” In telegram
                        2175, February 9, <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> reported

                    <p>The President had a conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> both before and after the luncheon he and Mrs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> hosted for Mr. and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>. The reporting officer was not
                        present at the conversation after lunch. That conversation is reported on
                        the basis of the information given by the President to the drafter. The
                        following subjects were discussed before lunch:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Cuba</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> stated that he had had
                        two conversations with <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>, each
                        lasting about three hours. <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> had
                        been rather reasonable in his remarks about the United States, but in view
                        of the strain in US-Cuban relations, had not asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> to convey any message to the
                        President. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> wondered
                        whether the United States realized that by its unfriendly attitude toward
                            <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> it was pushing Cuba farther
                        and farther away.</p>
                    <p>The President emphasized that the strong reaction in the United States toward
                        events in Cuba was due to the fact that over the past hundred and some odd
                        years, the United States had had no hostile power close to its borders.
                        Therefore, when a group which preached hostility toward <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0385"/>the United States seized power in Cuba, the
                        reaction in the United States was bound to be very strong. The US was
                        psychologically unprepared for such a change. The President pointed out that
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would have the same reaction if a
                        hostile group arose in the vicinity of its borders. In this connection, the
                        President referred to the Soviet reaction to the Hungarian uprising.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Laos</p>
                    <p>The President emphasized that the United States intends to use every means to
                        influence the Boun Oum Government to accept the formation of a Government
                        under <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna</persName>. He said that he
                        realized that on both sides in Laos there were groups who desired renewal of
                        military action. On the one side, there are people who believe that they
                        would win in that event; while on the other side, on the right, there are
                        people who think that resumption of hostilities would involve the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> wondered whether the
                        United States, proceeding from the premise of false contradictions between
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and China, was seeking to delay
                        the solution of the Laotian question and to exploit the Laotian situation
                        for the purpose of aggravating Sino-Soviet relations.</p>
                    <p>The President categorically denied that the United States was seeking to
                        exacerbate Sino-Soviet relations over the Laotian question. He said that
                        such policy would be unwise. However, he said it was his belief that the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, just as the US, was more
                        interested in a peaceful solution of the Laotian situation than China. He
                        said he thought that both the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were interested in a peaceful solution in Laos because
                        Laos was far from either of the two countries and was not an area of vital
                        interest to them. The President reiterated that the US was going to make
                        every effort to get the Boun Oum Government to accept a reasonable solution
                        under Souvanna. He expressed the hope that both sides would exert their
                        influence during the next few days in order to prevent renewal of
                        hostilities, which would be fraught with disastrous consequences.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> said that he was
                        gratified to hear the President's views and that he would report them
                        immediately to Moscow. However, he said he was sorry that the US and the

                        difficulty in finding a mutual accommodation on matters that are not vitally
                        important to them, rather than on those in which they have vital
                        interests.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons</p>
                    <p>The President observed that one of the basic tenets of US foreign policy is
                        that the US is opposed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He recalled,
                        in this connection, his statement during the interview he gave Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> last fall.<note n="2" xml:id="d150fn2">See <ref target="#d134">Document 134</ref>.</note> The
                        President reiterated that the US is opposed to <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0386"/>Germany's acquiring nuclear weapons, just as it is opposed
                        to any other States' acquiring such weapons. He referred to the fact that
                        the US has not given France any information necessary for the development of
                        a nuclear capability. In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>'s question as to whether the US was opposed to
                        giving nuclear weapons to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as a group
                        of States, the President said that such an arrangement might be one way of
                        discouraging individual States from seeking to acquire nuclear weapons. He
                        said that the United States was concerned that at some point France would
                        realize how expensive development of nuclear weapons and of means of
                        delivery was, and that at that point, West Germany and France might join
                        forces in their effort to develop a nuclear capability of their own. A
                        multilateral arrangement with regard to control of nuclear weapons might be
                        a solution to this problem. However, the President expressed doubt that a
                        satisfactory formula for such an arrangement could be found.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> reacted rather
                        impulsively to this statement by the President, saying that if nuclear
                        weapons were given to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, they would also
                        be given to the Warsaw Pact. He said that the Warsaw Pact would have less
                        difficulty in developing a formula. He then said that the President should
                        stop reading diplomatic despatches and should send someone who could give
                        him a first-hand account of what is really going on in the Soviet Union. He
                        said that the Soviet people are peace-loving and friendly, but also tough
                        and full of resolve and can resort to extreme measures. This led to a
                        discussion on Berlin.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Berlin</p>
                    <p>The President pointed out that Berlin was a very involved situation and that
                        it would be rather difficult to find a perfect solution for it. However, he
                        did not see why at least a temporary arrangement satisfactory to both sides
                        could not be found. After all, he said, no one knew what situation would
                        prevail five or ten years from now. He observed that there was no need in
                        telling him that the Soviet people were tough and full of resolve because he
                        knew that very well and was quite familiar with the history of the past war.
                        In any event, this was not the point. The American people were also tough,
                        and could also resort to extreme measures. The question is how to avoid
                        resort to extreme measures—and this is the task of leadership. In spite of
                        French wishes to the contrary, the US had engaged in conversation with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in Moscow, hoping that later
                        negotiations could be transferred to a higher level. However, the Soviet

                        we had been before; <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0387"/>and, in fact,
                        created the impression that the Soviet Union slammed the door in front of
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> said that he was not
                        familiar with the details of the talks between Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The following topics were discussed during the conversation after
                        luncheon:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Cuba</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> wondered whether the US
                        would prefer Cuba to develop into a State like Yugoslavia or have it drift
                        in the direction of China. He noted that there were quite a few Chinese in
                        Cuba. He emphasized that, primarily because of Cuban fears of US invasion,
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was seeking to help Cuban economy
                        and was buying more sugar from Cuba than it really needed and was pumping
                        more money into that country than it really wanted to. He also raised the
                        question of Cuban volunteers and inquired whether the US intended to invade
                        Cuba.</p>
                    <p>The President replied in the negative.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Germany and Berlin</p>
                    <p>The President went over the text of the Soviet memorandum given Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>, and there was some
                        conversation which was rather inconclusive.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Sino-Soviet Relations</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> admitted some differences
                        between China and the USSR, but emphasized that China and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be together if there was any
                        aggression.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. The Molotov Situation</p>
                    <p>At one point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> said that
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was of the opinion
                        that if a plebiscite had been taken in 1957, Molotov would have obtained 95%
                        of the votes and he only 5%. On the other hand, if a poll were taken today,
                        it would be Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> who would
                        obtain 95% of the votes and Mr. Molotov would get only 5%.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the conversation, both before and after lunch, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> seemed to emphasize that he is
                        regarded in the Soviet Union as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s “American boy.” He also expressed his concern
                        about what he seemed to regard as humiliations. In this connection, he
                        referred to some press story which said that he had actually imposed himself
                        on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName>, as well as to the way
                        the matter of the Attorney General's possible visit to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KMA1">Kharlamov</persName>

                        with the press. At one point, he remarked that he had certain ambitions and
                        that he did not wish to die politically.<note n="4" xml:id="d150fn4">

                        were arranged to discuss a television show featuring the President and

                            that the Soviet Union would be receptive to a visit by Attorney General

                            and <persName corresp="#p_BGN1">Bolshakov</persName> agreed to meet with

                    </p>
                    <p>The first meeting on Sunday night was a social affair at the home of Cecil
                        Lyon, Minister at the United States Embassy in Paris. Also present were:
                        Pierre Baraduc, Chief of the Press Office of the French Foreign Ministry;
                        John Mowinkle, the Public Information Officer for <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> in France; Jack Hedges, Press Officer for <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> at our Paris Embassy; and Mr. Kondrashev,
                        Press Attaché of the Soviet Embassy in Paris. The evening was largely a
                        social affair but Khalarmov did make these points:</p>
                    <p>(1) Molotov is not going back to Vienna. He is remaining in Moscow. Khalarmov
                        described him as a “political cadaver” who has no significance <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0389"/>and to whom no one pays any attention in
                        the Soviet Union. He says the news that Molotov is going back to Vienna was
                        in error; someone with the International Atomic Energy group in Vienna
                        bought him a ticket thinking he was returning to Vienna.</p>
                    <p>(2) People in the west should not take any stock in the story that there is a
                        crisis in the Kremlin. There is no such crisis. Khalarmov pointed out that
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had been on vacation
                        in the country; <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> had been in
                        Africa; other Soviet officials were traveling in the Soviet Union. He said
                        if there were a crisis these movements would not have been possible.</p>
                    <p>Khalarmov and Baraduc exchanged a long series of statements on the subject of
                        censorship. This was opened by Baraduc's expression of unhappiness upon the
                        barring from the Soviet Union a French correspondent named Sascha Simon of
                        Le Figaro. Khalarmov replied this did not seem to be a practice limited to
                        Communist countries and pointed to French government statements on the
                        exclusion of <gloss target="#t_NBC1">NBC</gloss>'s John Rich from Paris.</p>
                    <p>On Monday, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName> and I met with
                        Khalarmov at the Soviet Embassy. We were accompanied by Mr. Burton an
                        interpreter from the American Embassy. Khalarmov also had an interpreter
                        with him. We immediately got down to the subject of the television exchange.
                        Khalarmov brought up the subject of the amount of time each of the
                        Principals could expect and asked whether our 7-1/2 minute proposal was one
                        to which we were wedded. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName>
                        and I expressed the belief that it was not a hard and fast proposal.
                        Khalarmov asked if we could extend the time. We then proposed 15 minutes for
                        each and he assented to this.</p>
                    <p>It was also decided the Chairman and the President would be simultaneously
                        translated. The translation would be done by someone of each government's
                        choice, i.e., <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would be
                        translated by someone of Soviet choice; <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> would
                        be translated by American choice. In addition, each side would provide the
                        other with an authorized translation of the Principals' statements. This
                        would obviate any charge of changing the meaning through translation.
                        Khalarmov pointed out the problems of translation by citing the
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> interview, which had been given in English to five
                        different people, then translated by them into Russian and in turn given to
                        five other people who translated it back into English. He said the result
                        was five different interviews.</p>
                    <p>We next discussed the order of appearance of the two Principals. It was
                        determined that each of the two countries could exercise its own decision as
                        to what order to broadcast the Principals. In the subsequent world-wide
                        distribution of the program the order could be determined by the country in
                        which it was shown.</p>
                    <p>Khalarmov then brought up the point of exchanging drafts. He said he thought
                        it would be helpful if each could exchange drafts before finally filming the
                        show. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName> stated we did not
                        want the exchange <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0390"/>of drafts to
                        become a stumbling block to the actual filming of the program through the
                        continuous exchange of drafts until both sides were satisfied. Khalarmov
                        agreed that there would be only one exchange of drafts. Following that
                        exchange each Principal would be free to say what he wanted to say. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName> suggested that they
                        address themselves to the general topic of “What Kind of a World I Would
                        Like to Live In.” Khalarmov agreed the first discussion should be a general
                        one but that neither Principal should be tied down to the substance of his
                        discussion. Khalarmov also stated he hoped after the first general
                        exposition of views by the President and the Chairman that it might be
                        possible to have future programs in which they could discuss specific
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>Khalarmov also said—and we agreed—that the television show should be used to
                        advance relations between the two countries and that neither side should use
                        it to restate well-known polemics of the cold war.</p>
                    <p>Khalarmov said the only matter on which he would have to check with the
                        Chairman would be the timing. He asked if we had a time in mind. We opened
                        by offering March 15, 1962. In a subsequent discussion on the simultaneous
                        showing of the film in the United States and Moscow, we decided to propose
                        the date of Sunday, March 18th with a release time in Moscow of 7:00 p.m.
                        and a 12:00 noon release in Washington; there, of course, being no bar to
                        the replaying of the program. It was further decided that the drafts would
                        be exchanged by March 1st with the filming to be done around March 9th or
                        10th.</p>
                    <p>The technical problems re the compatibility of American and Soviet equipment
                        was discussed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName> and Mr.
                        Khalarmov agreed that the initial film would be done on 35mm film and that
                        each side would then convert to whatever was most necessary, such as 16mm
                        film or video tape.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Khalarmov agreed to seek the greatest possible distribution of the film
                        in countries under Soviet influence. He pointed out that there was a direct
                        television cable link from Moscow with Prague, Budapest and Warsaw. He said
                        he would also look into the matter of Rumania and Yugoslavia. Both sides
                        agreed however that the film should be given the widest possible
                        dissemination around the world.</p>
                    <p>Khalarmov said he would go back to Moscow, arriving in about seven days and
                        would communicate to me the decision of the Chairman in regard to the date.
                        He also suggested that all future communications in regard to this
                        particular problem be conducted through the channel in which the
                        arrangements for our meeting had been made.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of this part of the discussion, Khalarmov asked if there
                        were any other matters which should be brought up. I told him that, through
                        a Soviet source, the question of a direct telephone channel between the
                        President and the Chairman had been raised. I asked him if my information
                        was correct. Khalarmov said it was correct; that someone <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0391"/>(an American) a year or a year-and-a-half
                        ago had contacted him about installing such a circuit; there had been some
                        discussion of this subject and great interest evinced. He said, however,
                        that he had never been apprised of the President's interest on this matter.
                        I told him I had not discussed the subject with the President and was,
                        therefore, not in a position to report his interest or disinterest; that if
                        Soviet interest reflected any real desire in this connection I would take it
                        up with the President. Khalarmov said he would look into the matter himself
                        and report back to me. He said, however, that in times of crisis it would be
                        most effective to have instantaneous communication between the Chairman and
                        the President.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Khalarmov then brought up the subject of Laos. He said the United States
                        government should exert further pressure on Boun Oum to bring about a
                        solution of the problem of Laos. I stated that the President and the
                        Chairman had agreed at Vienna that the best possible solution was the
                        creation of a neutral and independent Laos and I said I knew we were working
                        toward that end. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName> said that any
                        government may, from time to time, have trouble with its own allies and
                        pointed to the present Soviet difficulties with Red China. Mr. Khalarmov
                        replied that this was not the same. Khalarmov went on to say that the Soviet
                        Union agreed that there should be a neutral and independent Laos and the
                        solution on the problem of Laos could lead to the solution of other
                        problems. It would also lead the people of the Soviet Union to believe that
                        the Soviet Union could do business with the people of the United States.</p>
                    <p>This discussion broke up at around 12:30 p.m. followed by lunch during which
                        the conversation was almost entirely social. A great many barbs were aimed
                        by Khalarmov at Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName>; accusing
                        him of playing the role of a “master propagandist”. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName> replied that he wished Khalarmov
                        could testify before the Senate Appropriations Committee for such testimony
                        would no doubt go far in increasing the <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> budget. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName>
                        inquired when the Soviet Union was going to stop jamming the Voice of
                        America. Khalarmov said the jamming would stop when <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> presented a reasonable view of the Soviet Union. The
                        meeting concluded with the understanding between Khalarmov and me that no
                        announcement or statement would be made until he had time to check with the
                        Chairman. We agreed the Soviet Union and the United States would make a
                        joint announcement of the broadcast on approximately March 9th or 10th; the
                        texts to be mutually agreed to in advance. I agreed that if questioned by
                        reporters, I would make a general statement to the effect that we had had a
                        general discussion of improving Soviet-American communications; that I would
                        make no statements with reference to the television broadcast.</p>

                        all the conditions discussed between myself and <persName corresp="#p_KMA1">Mikhail Khalarmov</persName> in Paris.<note n="2" xml:id="d154fn2">See

                        Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has suggested the
                        following dates to which I have tentatively agreed—</p>
                    <p>(a) Exchange of draft statements on March 8 (through <persName corresp="#p_BGN1">Georgi Bolshakov</persName>).</p>
                    <p>(b) Announcement on March 15. I am to prepare a draft announcement and submit
                        it to Khalarmov for approval.</p>
                    <p>(c) Exchange of film on March 18. Film to be delivered to the American
                        Embassy in Moscow; Soviet Embassy in Washington.</p>
                    <p>(d) First showing at 8:00 p.m., Moscow time on March 25 and 12:00 noon,
                            <gloss target="#t_EST1">EST</gloss>, March 25.</p>
                    <p>(2) <persName corresp="#p_BGN1">Bolshakov</persName> wanted to know if there
                        was any further information on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert F.
                            Kennedy</persName>'s intentions.</p>
                    <p>(3) Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is very
                        interested in the Washington-Moscow telephone set-up discussed in Paris. If
                        the President is interested in this proposal, the Soviets would like to
                        institute technical discussions on how to work it out.</p>
                    <p>(4) In regard to the current cultural exchange negotiations,<note n="3" xml:id="d154fn3">See <ref target="#d168">Document 168</ref>.</note> Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGN1">Bolshakov</persName> feels there are certain
                        points which the Americans are being difficult about—</p>
                    <p>(a) Re artistic troupes the exchange has been on the basis of one troupe for
                        one troupe. <persName corresp="#p_BGN1">Bolshakov</persName> says the
                        Americans are imposing equality of pay for the troupes. The Soviets do not
                        feel this is equitable. He points out that an exchange might involve the
                        Moishev Ballet for the Benny Goodman band which are not comparable
                        organizations. Further, he said travelling distances in the Soviet Union are
                        much longer than in the United States; that the United States has much
                        bigger halls. He suggested that the matter of payment be left to the
                        impressarios.</p>
                    <p>(b) <persName corresp="#p_BGN1">Bolshakov</persName> said the Americans are
                        insisting on the rights of American students to go to Russian research
                        institutes. He said such institutes are not primarily educational
                        institutions and that our government should understand the difference. They
                        have no objection for some of our students attending some of these
                        institutes but do not want it written into the contract of agreement.</p>
                    <p>(c) There are 30 categories of technical exchanges. The United States is
                        proposing one exchange in only two of the 30 categories; the Soviets are
                        proposing 5 out of 15 categories. The Soviets feel that the base upon which
                        the Americans are working is too narrow.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGN1">Bolshakov</persName> and I went on to discuss
                        the recent articles in the New York Times by Harrison Salisbury. He said
                        Salisbury's views on Soviet activity are governed by impressions gained when
                        Salisbury covered the Stalin period. He said this is true of most American
                        Soviet experts. He said the United States has to adjust to change in the
                        Soviet Union and its thinking.</p>

                    <p>In a February 15, 1962, letter to Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> wrote that he had concluded that negotiations on
                        Berlin would be protracted but believed that, over the longer term,
                        agreement might still be reached. In the meantime, he argued, neither side
                        should undertake any step which could lead to an increase in tensions over
                        Berlin. The President also mentioned the possibility of creating an
                        international commission with East German participation which would

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Foreign Policy Developments</p>
                    <p>Moscow last week made a number of diverse moves which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> probably calculates will draw
                        the West into top-level contacts later in the year. His probable aim is to
                        use a summit conference as the occasion for new Soviet disarmament proposals
                        and to consider the diplomatic impasse on Berlin.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> publicized the release of <persName corresp="#p_PFG1">Francis Powers</persName> on 10 February as an effort
                        to improve US-Soviet relations. This was followed on 11 February by
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s relatively moderate
                            letter<note n="2" xml:id="d156fn2">For text, dated February 10, see <ref target="frus1961-63v06">

                        than the foreign ministers, as the West had suggested—meet at Geneva prior
                        to the 18-nation disarmament conference opening on 14 March. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> retained a free hand to accept
                        the Western proposals and press for a summit later.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> resumed pressure
                        on the Western position in Berlin by attempting to impose temporary
                        conditions on the use of the air corridors. This maneuver, together with
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s adamant stand in the
                        Moscow talks with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>, suggests that <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0395"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is seeking to impress on
                        the Western powers that Berlin remains a potentially dangerous
                        situation.</p>

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s letter of 11 February
                        was nonpolemical and in sharp contrast to vitriolic Soviet propaganda that
                        US policy is hypocritical. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        noted that US and Soviet “reasoning, on the whole, runs in the same
                        direction,” and he expressed hope that the West would “rightly understand
                        the motives which have prompted” the Soviet proposal. He went to some
                        lengths to disclaim that his proposal was a mere propaganda gesture by
                        admitting that participation by the heads of government was “unusual” and by
                        claiming that he was actually drafting his proposal when the letters from
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>
                        <note n="3" xml:id="d156fn3">Dated February 7; for text, see ibid., pp.
                            85-87.</note> were received. Moreover, he acknowledged that the heads of
                        government could not be expected to complete a final treaty, but that their
                        presence would provide the committee with a “powerful and correct start” and
                        open the way for a “breakthrough in international relations.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s immediate and tactical
                        aim in calling for an 18-nation summit was to regain the initiative by
                        countering the US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> proposals. He emphasized
                        that “direct contacts between national leaders” had become an “established
                        international practice,” and he accepted the President's proposals for a
                        “broader exchange of opinions” between the heads of government. Moreover, he
                        did not rule out acceptance of the Western proposal for a foreign ministers'
                        conference to precede the Geneva meeting, stating: “It goes without saying
                        that the foreign ministers must also take part … both with the heads of
                        government and in the subsequent period … .”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> specifically stated that
                        the heads-of-government meeting he proposed should not be considered a
                        substitute for a summit meeting “as it is generally understood.” This may
                        foreshadow an effort to arrange a four-power summit at a later date with an
                        agenda broader than disarmament, or to use an 18-nation heads-of-government
                        meeting as the forum for establishing contacts with the US on other
                        international issues, particularly Berlin.</p>
                    <p>While the release of <persName corresp="#p_PFG1">Powers</persName> and the
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> letter point toward a
                        Soviet effort at establishing a more favorable climate for resuming
                        top-level contacts, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has
                        been careful not to over-commit the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                        a general relaxation of tensions. His letter was followed by an
                        authoritative <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> “Observer” article on 13
                        February which sharply attacked the West for proposing a foreign ministers'
                        conference while preparing for a series of nuclear tests. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s letter, moreover, left <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0396"/>open the possibility that he might
                        go to Geneva regardless of the Western position. He may view the Geneva
                        conference as an ideal forum to project an image of greater interest in
                        disarmament than the West, and may believe that the prospect of attendance
                        by some neutral leaders would force a reversal by the West.</p>
                    <p>The presence of other leaders might appeal to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> if he plans to unveil some new disarmament
                        package. His letter avoided all the substantive points raised by the
                        President and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>. This failure to reply, particularly on the important
                        question of dividing disarmament into three separate categories for
                        immediate consideration, suggests that he may initiate further
                        correspondence on the substantive issues. Soviet diplomats in London have
                        hinted that Moscow is considering new comprehensive disarmament proposals
                        which would include the standard plan for complete and general disarmament
                        plus some immediate steps in the field of European security and partial
                        disarmament.</p>
                    <p>In an 8 February conversation with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> in Moscow, the new Soviet ambassador to Washington,
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Anatoly Dobrynin</persName>, said that he
                        was “not clear” concerning what the West had in mind with respect to the
                        third disarmament category and inquired if this referred to such steps as
                        measures “against surprise attack.” He emphasized the importance of making a
                        start “somewhere” on the question of disarmament and expressed the belief
                        that atomic testing would be a “good field in which to begin.” <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that as a “layman” he could
                        not understand why the US could not now agree to a ban on atmospheric
                        testing without inspection and control, as it had “surely been demonstrated”
                        that the US had the capacity of detecting atmospheric tests without control
                        stations in the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s remarks suggest that the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> expects the test question will be
                        raised at the 18-nation talks, despite the formal Soviet rejection of the
                            US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> proposal to merge the test ban
                        question with the talks on general and complete disarmament. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may be considering putting forth a formal
                        proposal which would be restricted to a ban on atmospheric tests in line
                        with the <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> proposal of 3 September. Soviet leaders would
                        probably calculate that such a proposal could embarrass the West and draw
                        considerable support from the nonaligned powers represented at Geneva.</p>
                    <p>Since the US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> announcement of tentative
                        plans for US atmospheric tests at Christmas Island and British underground
                        testing in Nevada, Moscow has initiated a propaganda campaign charging that
                        the tests are a “certainty” and accusing the West of having broken off the
                        test ban talks to continue with its test program. A <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> article said that the new series of Western tests “is
                        clearly linked” with plans for making <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0397"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> a fourth nuclear power. <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi> warned that if the West conducts nuclear
                        tests, “the Soviet Union will have to resume testing.”</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Berlin and Germany</p>
                    <p>Soviet moves to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate with the West have not
                        been accompanied by any effort at compromise in the <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> talks. While <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> has simply reiterated previous positions, he has not
                        yet indicated that he is ready to break off the dialogue. The Soviet
                        attempts this week to place temporary restrictions on Western use of the
                        Berlin air corridors, together with the deliberate stalling in the <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> talks, may be aimed at inducing the Western powers
                        either to move directly into formal negotiations or to make concessions.</p>
                    <p>By resorting to unilateral moves in the sensitive area of access, the Soviet
                        leaders may be attempting to demonstrate that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s withdrawal of a deadline for a separate treaty
                        should not be interpreted as an indication that Moscow will be content with
                        the status quo in Berlin. This attitude was emphasized in a long article in
                        a special edition of <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi> on 11 February which
                        accused the West of avoiding solutions of major international issues and of
                        playing for time, particularly on the Berlin question.</p>
                    <p>Soviet interference with air access to Berlin began on 7 February when the
                        Soviet controller at the Berlin Air Safety Center (<gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss>) announced that Soviet military transports would “engage”
                        the southern air corridor from Frankfurt to Berlin at altitudes up to 7,000
                        feet for three and a half hours on 8 February. While it is unusual but not
                        unprecedented for Soviet planes to conduct maneuvers in the corridors, the
                        prior announcement and attempt to “reserve” the bulk of the corridor
                        airspace were clearly designed to infringe on unrestricted Western access.
                        The Soviet controller refused to file flight plans for Soviet aircraft, as
                        is customary, and refused to guarantee flight safety for Western aircraft
                        flying within the altitudes “engaged” by the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>The procedure was repeated for the northern and central corridors on 9 and 12
                        February, although on the latter date the Soviets canceled their
                        restrictions. However, restrictions were reinstituted for 14 February, and
                        for 15 February for the southern corridor. For the first time, the Soviets
                        warned that if Western aircraft flew at altitudes planned for Soviet planes,
                        this would be considered as “trespassing with resultant consequences.”</p>
                    <p>This warning was followed by a “strong protest” against alleged Western
                        violations of established procedures and a demand that Allied flights cease
                        unless given specific Soviet approval. These moves, together with the first
                        deliberate harassment of incoming flights on 14 February and again on 15
                        February, indicated that the Soviets were carefully but deliberately raising
                        the level of tensions. The further attempts to impose <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0398"/>conditions on Western flights on the
                        grounds that the Allies must have Soviet approval may have been intended as
                        an implicit warning that the Soviets would withdraw from the four-power air
                        safety center.</p>

                    <p>In a memorandum to the President, approved at a meeting in Secretary of State
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s office on February 20,
                        1962, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked: “If there is no
                        reason to believe that the Soviets will agree to a test ban of a type we
                        deem necessary to safeguard our national security over the long run, can we
                        risk our national security by gambling that the Soviets will parallel
                        restraints we could unilaterally impose on ourselves? I do not personally
                        believe we can accept this risk.” <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                        continued later in the memorandum: “My recommendation, therefore, is that
                        you decide to order such atmospheric nuclear weapons tests as you may deem
                        militarily necessary along lines of the program proposed.” <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> added that “I should like to emphasize
                        the importance of preparing our allies and friends in other parts of the
                        world to assist us in facing up to the criticism which a test series will

                        barred. Believe target should be average Soviet citizen and that problem
                        uppermost in his mind is peace. Therefore suggest plug for disarmament might
                        be one of main themes. Description of what could be done with savings on
                        arms expenditure <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0399"/>might enable
                        President to deal both with Soviet charge that our munitions manufacturers
                        oppose disarmament as well as to show how well off our people presently are.
                        For example New York electrical workers now have 25-hour week; with
                        disarmament everyone could have the same. Believe friendly tone of <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> interview made great impression
                        here and similar expression of good will would be most useful. Support for
                        exchange program would be useful and could be peg for following line. We
                        would like more visitors come to US not in order to try to sell them our
                        system but to help do away with suspicion and mistrust which is greatest
                        obstacle to peace today. Such visitors can see for themselves good will of
                        American people and lack of any incentive on our part to expand or dominate
                        other countries. President might say we would like to see Soviet people
                        similarly prosper and be content as this is also in interest of peace.
                        Should more controversial approach be permitted, President might point out
                        that he is aware of much discussion in Soviet Union of policies of Stalin
                        but such discussion appears to ignore Stalin's actions in field of foreign
                        affairs which gave rise to much of the mistrust of Soviet Union by American
                        people. Soviets have built up image of Roosevelt and use suitable Roosevelt
                        quotation might be helpful.</p>
                    <p>Youth of Soviet Union is element most dissatisfied with old Communist methods
                        and there is considerable admiration for youthful leadership in US.
                        Therefore any statement appealing to youth would be effective.</p>
                    <p>While in short speech targets must be limited, may be opportunity to deal
                        with one or more of strongest Soviet misconceptions about US, namely: that
                        we are colonialist power; that higher education beyond reach of average
                        American; that few can afford adequate medical care; that unemployed get no
                        relief.</p>
                    <p>In making arrangements would be highly desirable to obtain commitment that
                        prior announcement of telecast would appear in newspapers; otherwise
                        audience here will be greatly restricted.</p>
                    <p>An alternative approach might be for President to discuss what problems we
                        are dealing with in US—agricultural surpluses, segregation, urban renewal,
                        automation, etc.—but am inclined to think disarmament or exchange agreement
                        better pegs.<note n="4" xml:id="d158fn4">On February 20 <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had also asked <persName corresp="#p_KGF1">Kennan</persName> for his views on the television

                            disarmament. The President should also stress that the United States had
                            no designs on other countries, believed in the possibility of peaceful
                            coexistence, and realized that some important problems were probably not

                    </list>
                    <p>The President will have the same advantages in his TV appearance with
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that he had in the
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> debates: obvious sincerity,
                        obvious ability, obvious youth and vigor. This appearance, then, should not
                        be a statement or speech which incidentally is filmed but one which is
                        skillfully produced to take full advantage of the man and the medium so as
                        to enhance the persuasiveness of his arguments.</p>
                    <p>To this end the President should be informal, perhaps sitting in his
                        rocking-chair in his office. He should use two or three words of Russian,
                        and address his Soviet audience directly as “you”. He should limit his
                        presentation to several main themes, easily repeatable by word-of-mouth (the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has only a limited number of TV
                        sets). He should be positive, not negative, and avoid making “debater's
                        points” which might put him one-up on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> but would not convince many in his audience.</p>
                    <p>To establish rapport he should make some cultural or literary reference to
                        Russian authors or artists, and refer to his own visit to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in the late 1930s. He might informally
                        introduce his wife at the close of his remarks.</p>
                    <p>Questions and comments directed to Russian-speaking guides at our recent
                        exhibits in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> provide a useful
                        insight into the Soviet public's chief concerns and misconceptions about the
                        U.S. and its policies. Based on this experience and the advice of our
                        demonologists, we recommend that the President emphasize:</p>
                    <p>1. The earnest desire of the U.S. for peace. We want equitable and peaceful
                        solutions to world problems. We have never started a war and never will. We
                        support an effective U.N. as the best hope for just and peaceful solutions
                        to international quarrels. The President might relate Soviet suffering
                        during World War II (“You understand what war is”) to his own war experience
                        and injury and his brother's death.</p>
                    <p>Our desire for equitable and peaceful solutions is not so much a point in
                        itself but a thread to be woven throughout his remarks.</p>
                    <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0401"/>
                    <p>2. The U.S. position on:</p>
                    <p>(a) Berlin. A restatement along the lines of the President's very effective
                        presentation to <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName> would be
                        most desirable.</p>
                    <p>(b) Disarmament and nuclear testing. We invented the atom bomb and had a
                        monopoly on it until 1949. During the time we were the only atomic power we
                        sought to share our knowledge with the Soviet Union and others but the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in 1946 rejected the Baruch Plan
                        for turning over all our military and peaceful atomic resources to
                        international authority. President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>'s 1955 “Open Skies” proposal, which would have
                        permitted the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the U.S. to keep an
                        eye on each other's military preparations, was rejected by the Soviet Union.
                        At our initiative, talks were undertaken in Geneva in 1958 among the U.S.,
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Britain in an effort to agree
                        on a treaty banning nuclear testing. We also proposed that all testing be
                        suspended during these talks. The Soviet Union broke that moratorium by
                        resuming atomic testing in the atmosphere in September of last year. Then
                        the U.S. (and Britain) proposed to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that their governments agree at once to halt
                        atmospheric tests but the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> turned down
                        the offer. Later in September President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> challenged the Soviet Union to a “peace race”
                        instead of an arms race and presented to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> a plan for “general and complete disarmament.” On October 27
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly, by a vote of 87 to
                        11, appealed to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> not to test a
                        50-megaton bomb. The Soviet Union voted against this resolution and three
                        days later exploded the bomb.</p>
                    <p>3. The welfare base of our free enterprise (or mixed economy) system. (The
                        average Soviet citizen thinks the American worker lives and toils in an
                        economic jungle, unprotected from unemployment and the hazards of old age,
                        ill health and accident. He also believes our economy is subject to regular
                        booms and busts with the latter more frequent and longer-lasting than the
                        former.) The American government, national and local, has a deep and abiding
                        concern for the welfare and happiness of all its citizens. This concern
                        dates back to the revolutionary beginnings of our republic when the new
                        Constitution declared that providing “for the general welfare” of our
                        citizens is a major purpose and essential function of the American
                        Government. This was emphatically reaffirmed by President Roosevelt in the
                        1930s. (FYI: FDR is a favorable symbol of the U.S. in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.)</p>
                    <p>Last year, the average pay of an American industrial worker was more than
                        $420 or 378 new rubles per month. To give you a better idea of what this
                        means, the worker was paying $8.50 (or 7 rubles, 65 kopecks) for a pair of
                        shoes. His suit cost him $40 (or 36 rubles). He paid about $2,000 (or 1,800
                        rubles) for his six-passenger automobile.</p>
                    <p>Should this worker lose his job, he would receive about $150 (or 135 rubles)
                        per month for up to nine months. However, few workers are unemployed <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0402"/>for such a long time. The average
                        period of unemployment in 1961 was less than four months.</p>
                    <p>When the worker retires because of old age or disability, he and his family
                        are supported by monthly payments from a government fund to which he and his
                        employer have contributed. This is often supplemented by further payments
                        from his employer.</p>
                    <p>As the President told the Congress February 6,<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn2">For text of the President's Special Message to Congress on Education,
                            February 6, 1962, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents

                        the mainspring of our economic and social progress.” The Russians say
                        (phonetically: “oochaynya svee-et ah niyeh oochaynya tmah” (“Education is
                        light; ignorance is darkness”). So it is that in the U.S., every child has
                        the right to 12 years of free education. One-fourth of all American young
                        people between 18 and 21 are enrolled in institutions of higher learning.
                        (Avoid use of the word “college” which is misunderstood in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.)</p>
                    <p>In closing, the President might express his desire for further communication
                        between the two nations such as that afforded by this joint TV
                        appearance.</p>
                    <p>One obvious reminder, Ted: the President's audience will be the whole world,
                        including our allies and the uncommitted nations, not just the USSR and the
                        U.S.</p>

                    <p>To examine the political situation in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the world Communist movement, particularly in the
                        light of the XXII Party Congress and developments in the Sino-Soviet
                        dispute, and to estimate major trends.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Principal Conclusions</p>
                    <p>A. Within the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> remains the most powerful single
                        leader, and we believe that his leadership is not in danger at present. His
                        control over policy, however, is subject to restraints; conservative
                        resistance has forced him to compromise or postpone his proposals on such
                        matters as economic policy, military force structure, and the party's role
                        in Soviet society.</p>
                    <p>B. Present trends suggest that, over the long term, popular aspirations are
                        likely to acquire a larger influence in Soviet domestic politics. There are
                        some prospects for further moderation of totalitarian controls; however,
                        such a trend depends not only on social forces but also on external events
                        and developments in top level politics.</p>
                    <p>C. Sino-Soviet relations are in a critical phase just short of an
                        acknowledged and definitive split. There is no longer much chance of a
                        fundamental resolution of differences. In our view, the chances that such a
                        split can be avoided during 1962 are no better than even.<note n="2" xml:id="d160fn2">The Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, USAF,
                            believes that the chances of a definitive split during 1962 are much
                            less than even. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>D. The Sino-Soviet rivalry will continue to have disrupting effects upon the
                        international Communist movement, and these will greatly intensify if a
                        definitive split occurs. Whatever the outcome of the present Sino-Soviet
                        crisis, we believe that the pressures for national autonomy within the
                        international Communist movement will present the Soviet leaders with
                        increasing difficulties, and that their control over it is likely to be
                        further diminished.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                    <p>1. The politics of the Communist world have continued in the past year to
                        grow more complicated and more controversial. The intensity with which
                        issues of policy and authority were posed at the XXII Congress has
                        highlighted the contradictions which are emerging as Soviet internal
                        development becomes more complex and as the world Communist movement becomes
                        larger and more diverse. Adjustment to these changing conditions is made
                        more difficult by the element of doctrinal rigidity in Communist theory and
                        practice and by the legacy of Stalinism. (Paras. 14-17)</p>
                    <p>2. These problems do not weaken the growing material base of economic
                        strength, scientific development, and military power which underlies the
                        Soviet threat. Nor have they had a significant effect upon the Soviet view
                        that the East-West conflict is a fundamental clash of systems or upon their
                        determination to press their aims in this conflict. Present Soviet moves
                        toward a détente in East-West relations may owe something to Moscow's desire
                        to contain tensions in this area while a crisis impends <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0404"/>in its relations with Peiping. While we
                        perceive no indication that the Soviets are abandoning their basic hostility
                        toward the West, there has been a shift in their tactics toward relatively
                        greater subtlety and flexibility in pursuing their foreign policy
                            objectives.<note n="3" xml:id="d160fn3">Soviet policies toward the
                            non-Communist world will be examined in a forthcoming estimate due in
                            March 1962. Chinese policies will be discussed in <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 13-62, “Communist China,” now scheduled
                            for completion in April. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. While basic attitudes toward the West are not in dispute among the Soviet
                        leaders, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s sponsorship of
                        successive reforms in internal policy has generated conflict with various
                        elements which resist his changes. In the past year, differences of opinion
                        have become evident over the important question of the relative priority of
                        welfare programs as against the traditionally favored sectors of heavy
                        industry and defense. Some contention has also been apparent over other
                        issues—the proper structure of the armed forces, the role of the party
                        apparatus in Soviet society, and the final disposition of the “antiparty
                        group.” Even the violent onslaught against Stalin at the Congress, which
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> conceived as a means
                        of weakening the opposition to his views, failed to resolve these problems.
                        (Paras. 18-21, 23-29)</p>
                    <p>4. We continue to believe that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> remains the most powerful single leader in Soviet
                        politics. Most top party leaders share his general outlook, and those who
                        resist various of his innovations do not appear to form a coherent faction
                        which is seeking his downfall. Indeed the lineup among his colleagues
                        probably changes from issue to issue. In addition to the difficulties of
                        securing agreement at the top, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in implementing his policies must rely primarily
                        on a party bureaucracy schooled in conservatism and jealous of its
                        traditions and privileges. In all these ways, he is subject to restraints
                        which have the effect of slowing down the pace of his reforms. (Paras. 22,
                        25, 30-32)</p>
                    <p>5. The attitudes of the Soviet people, on the other hand, represent a form of
                        largely silent pressure on the regime to proceed in the direction of further
                        reforms of the system. The traditionally compliant attitude of the
                        population has to some extent been upset in recent months by heightened
                        anxiety over the possibility of war over Berlin and a related concern over
                        the effects of international tensions on the already sagging rate of
                        improvement in living standards. In addition, the revelations of the XXII
                        Congress about the Stalin period and subsequent confusion within the party
                        have led to openly expressed skepticism and to considerable ferment among
                        intellectual circles. (Paras. 33-34)</p>
                    <p>6. We do not, however, foresee any sharp turning of the public mind toward
                        radical solutions. Not only is the regime able to capitalize upon the strong
                        sense of pride in national accomplishment, but the Soviet people are
                        accustomed to authoritarian rule. Current trends suggest <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0405"/>that, over the long term, popular
                        aspirations are likely to acquire a larger influence, and we believe that
                        there are some prospects for further moderation of totalitarian controls.
                        But this will depend on external events and developments in top level
                        politics as well as on the identifiable forces for change which are clearly
                        now at work within Soviet society. (Paras. 35-37)</p>
                    <p>7. A far more critical question has been posed by the moves launched at the
                        Congress against Communist China's challenge to Soviet policies and
                        international authority. While the condemnations of Stalin and the
                        “antiparty group” were also conceived as part of the rebuttal to China, the
                        main vehicle is the unremitting campaign against Albania. This Soviet
                        attack, and the unyielding Chinese response, have moved the Sino-Soviet
                        dispute into a critical phase just short of an acknowledged break. While
                        substantial differences on Communist strategy divide the two, these have now
                        been transcended by the even more fundamental question of authority, in
                        which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s traditional leadership of
                        the international Communist movement is at stake. (Paras. 15, 38-39, 45)</p>
                    <p>8. Considering the conflicting views and interests of the two parties, the
                        record of attack and counterattack, the liabilities already incurred, and
                        the uncompromising attitude of both, we believe that there is no longer much
                        chance of a fundamental resolution of Sino-Soviet differences. Indeed, the
                        question now is whether Moscow and Peiping will succeed in maintaining
                        formal unity, or whether they will take those remaining steps—undisguised
                        accusations of heresy and the formation of separate international
                        movements—which would constitute a definitive split. (Paras, 40-41,
                        46-47)</p>
                    <p>9. The considerations of self-interest which argue against such an outcome
                        must be fully evident to both parties. On the Chinese side, however, there
                        are important contrary factors, particularly the belief that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is turning away from revolutionary aims
                        and that Soviet policy is running counter to Chinese interests and
                        ambitions. These considerations, plus a certain xenophobic righteousness
                        which persuades Peiping that its policies could best carry the Bloc to
                        victory, have already led the Chinese to sacrifice many of the advantages of
                        the former relationship. For the Soviet part, remaining in partnership with
                        China involves the possibility of being drawn into riskier situations than
                        they wish to contemplate, and the probability of a continuing struggle
                        within the movement which could lay restraints on Soviet policy and enable
                        China to acquire an increasing authority in that movement. Thus the Soviet
                        leaders may now be considering whether, from the standpoint of their
                        national interests, a smaller movement in which they enjoyed undiluted
                        predominance would not be preferable to a larger movement which they could
                        not control. (Paras. 42-44)</p>
                    <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0406"/>
                    <p>10. Predictions cannot be confident, particularly since, with tensions so
                        high, the likelihood is increased that either the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or China could miscalculate the other's moves and
                        reactions. In our view, however, the chances that a definitive split can be
                        avoided during the current year are no better than even.<note n="4" xml:id="d160fn4">See the Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, USAF,
                            footnote to paragraph C of Principal Conclusions. [Footnote in the
                            source text.]</note> If such a split should occur, diplomatic and
                        economic ties between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and China
                        would be further reduced, though not necessarily severed. The military
                        alliance, whether openly renounced or not, would be of doubtful value to
                        either signatory, although each would still have a very heavy stake in the
                        preservation of Communist power in the other. The international Communist
                        movement would become a virtual battleground as both the Soviets and the
                        Chinese competed for the allegiance of other parties, fostered splits in
                        those non-bloc parties not firmly committed to one side or the other, and
                        used all the weapons of pressure and persuasion available to them to isolate
                        their rival. (Paras. 45, 47, 65, 75-76)</p>
                    <p>11. If no definitive split occurs, we believe that the Sino-Soviet
                        relationship will continue to be marked by tension and instability,
                        increasing and declining as events may occasion. In these circumstances, the
                        disruptive consequences for the international movement will continue to be
                        felt, although in a less intense and more manageable form than under
                        conditions of avowed rivalry. The present lineup finds Albania and the minor
                        parties of Asia in the Chinese camp, important elements in the Indian,
                        Indonesian, and Japanese Parties sympathetic to Peiping, and the North
                        Koreans and North Vietnamese seeking to maintain neutrality but edging
                        closer to Chinese positions. Outside Asia, Soviet authority generally
                        prevails, so far with little difficulty, against scattered pro-Chinese
                        elements. (Paras. 48, 60, 62-64, 66-72)</p>
                    <p>12. The Chinese challenge, however, tends to undermine Soviet authority even
                        among parties which are totally out of sympathy with Chinese views, just as
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s attacks on Stalin
                        tend to becloud the legitimacy of Soviet leadership even among Communists
                        who are not themselves Stalinists. As the international movement grows in
                        size and diversity, as the Satellite regimes become preoccupied with
                        national problems, as other parties acquire real prospects for sharing or
                        even seizing state power under circumstances which have no parallel in
                        Soviet experience, the virtue and necessity of following Soviet guidance is
                        being increasingly questioned. In these circumstances, the Soviets are under
                        considerable pressure to make concessions to national autonomy and to take
                        increasing account of diverse national views in framing the general
                        Communist line. (Paras. 15, 52, 66, 73)</p>
                    <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0407"/>
                    <p>13. Gradual adjustments in this direction might preserve for some time to
                        come the essentials of Soviet leadership, were it not that China is
                        simultaneously pressing rival policies and gaining adherents among other
                        parties. China's defiance dramatizes the inability of the professedly
                        internationalist Communist ideology to preserve the unity of a movement
                        embracing powerful nationalist forces, once the traditional sources of
                        Soviet authority had been weakened. No clear solution to this problem is in
                        sight, and we believe that the management of the international Communist
                        movement will present the Soviet leaders with increasing difficulties which
                        are likely, in one way or another, to result in a further diminution of
                        their control over it. (Paras. 50, 74)</p>

                        Germany, talked again last evening for two hours with Soviet Ambassador

                        my initiative, it was clear he had communicated with his government in
                        interval since we met on February 12.<note n="2" xml:id="d161fn2">In the

                            601.6168/2-1362)</note> He himself said he was not speaking officially
                        on behalf his government but also “not entirely personally”. In contrast
                        previous occasions, his remarks struck me as of considerable interest and
                        suggestive of changes in Soviet outlook which, if real, would be important.
                        Highlights as follows.</p>
                    <p>1. He dealt great length and emphasis on need for <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0408"/>improvement commercial relations between US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. When I voiced skepticism as to
                        importance this factor for either one of us, he made it clear this was
                        conceived by them as first step to wide political rapprochement including
                        many forms exchanges. When I asked him how he thought our specific political
                        differences of the moment would be helped by improvement commercial
                        relations, he said if we took correct path in this respect specific
                        political problems would die on the vine. Can't imagine what he could have
                        meant by this if not Berlin. I would not attach importance to this statement
                        if it did not represent new note in his approach and if I did not know as
                        historian how prone Russian Communists are to regard improvement commercial
                        relations as normal first public step toward genuine political
                        improvement.</p>
                    <p>2. He indicated suspicion we were delaying attempt to find solutions to
                        Soviet-Western differences in belief there might soon be internal changes in
                        Russia which would yield advantage from our stand-point. He asserted with
                        great vigor any such view would be wholly misconceived. Nothing of this sort
                        was happening. Policies announced by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> represented in every respect considered views of
                        Soviet government as whole. I told him I thought they were very wrong in
                        suspecting we had been misled in this way.</p>
                    <p>3. He showed much interest in <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s proposal for preliminary four-power meeting on

                            stated that France was prepared to participate in talks among the
                            nuclear powers, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament,
                                1962,</hi> vol. I, pp. 48-49.</note> and wanted to hear my opinion
                        of it. His government, he hinted, had come to no conclusion about it but was
                        very interested in the proposal and thought it might have merit. I pleaded
                        ignorance both of details proposal and of views my government.</p>
                    <p>4. He said he expected to remain Belgrade until at least March 3, when I
                        should be back here, adding that he was not even sure he would attend
                        Central Committee meeting March 5 at all since it would presumably deal only
                        with agriculture. I took this as hint if I expressed desire meeting with him
                        upon my return he would give precedence to this over Central Committee
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>While I do not have adequate information for judgment, point one above looks
                        to me like attempt to convey to us that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would be willing to permit Berlin situation to
                        simmer down and become quiescent again but can do this only if we save his
                        face by a general show of improvement US-Soviet bilateral relations.
                        Reference to internal problems could be warning either that we will not do
                        better by waiting for further internal developments within Soviet regime or
                        that any sort of progress in our relations could be vitiated if we allow it
                        to appear we are speculating on Soviet internal differences. I lean to first

                        analysis of Soviet intentions in Vietnam in telegram 2284 from Saigon,
                        February 26, 1962. He stated, among other things, that “we can assume Moscow
                        wishes avoid enlargement of hostilities into international conflict which
                        would heighten risk of major war. In this sense Vietnam not a vital Soviet
                        interest. However, if balance should tip in South Vietnam's favor, Soviets
                        might feel obliged to redress balance through greater support of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>: 1) to meet threat to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> itself, and 2) to prevent Chinese from

                        concluded that “whatever Soviet longer-range policy on Vietnam question may

                    <p>In telegram 1998 to Moscow, March 1, 1962, the Department of State instructed
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> to make a

                        on February 21 of interest, implications of what he was saying are not clear
                        and in our estimation are not persuasive of any particular conclusions.</p>
                    <p>As regards his emphasis on improvement of commercial relations between US and
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, since <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>'s visit in 1959 and subsequent trips of <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to US, this has been frequent Soviet theme by
                        which they are in reality talking about credits (long-term as well as
                        short-term) to make possible kind of trade they are interested in.
                        Lend-Lease negotiations in early 1960 made this all too clear. It is true
                        that Soviet leaders have been and are now perhaps prone to look upon better
                        economic relations as step toward an improvement of political atmosphere.
                        Most notable precedent, preliminaries to Nazi-Soviet pact 1939, was example
                        Soviet method using economic relations as beginning to political objectives.
                        However principal political issues today, i.e., Berlin, Laos, disarmament,
                        have already been subject of prolonged debate and negotiations between
                        parties at interest. Moreover, we find it difficult to believe after visits
                        of Soviet leaders here in 1959 when our position on economic relations was
                        explained at length to them by then Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, that Soviet Government could
                        genuinely consider it possible for legislative obstacles to improved
                        commercial relations to be <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0411"/>removed
                        before an improvement in political relations had occurred by a muting of
                        some of the sharpest international differences of today, notably Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Of course, if a settlement of major issues were reached and thereby tensions
                        in the world lessened, there would be created a better atmosphere for
                        increased trade. American traders would themselves be more confident in
                        dealing with Soviet organizations and would not fear public criticism.
                        Sustained improvement in the international climate might in due course
                        enable us to secure modification or removal of existing legislative
                        obstacles. But even then Soviets should recognize more than they have given
                        indication to date inherent limitations on trade between two countries whose
                        economies are so different and whose methods of trading so divergent. The
                        plain fact is that the Soviets, who tend to bilateral trading relationships
                        have relatively little to sell which is of interest to American
                        importers.</p>
                    <p>As regards possible internal changes in Russia, you were completely correct
                        in telling Ambassador he was wrong in suspecting us of any such attempts as
                        he asserted. We have no reason to doubt that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is effectively in charge of Soviet Government and
                            <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> and our policies are based on
                        these realities and not on any wishful thinking or in anticipation of
                        “advantage from our standpoint” as result of possible future Soviet internal
                        changes.</p>
                    <p>We leave entirely in your discretion your next contact with Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_YAA1">Yepishev</persName>. After your return to

                        comment along above lines but we see no necessity for you taking initiative
                        to seek interview with him before March 5.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> reports that an
                        unusual number of Soviet ambassadors have remained in Moscow, although some
                        of them were scheduled to return to their posts some time ago. While they
                        may be waiting for a routine briefing after <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s return, it is more likely that their presence
                        is connected with a review of foreign policy questions. Among them are the
                        ambassadors to London, Washington, Paris, and Rome; some of the ambassadors
                        to the satellite countries are also believed to have returned to Moscow
                        during the past several weeks. The Soviet ambassador to Laos returned
                        unexpectedly to Moscow on 20 February, and Deputy Foreign Minister Pushkin
                        failed to return to the Geneva conference on Laos as expected on 19
                        February. These developments suggest that a whole range of topics has been
                        up for reconsideration.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> comments that
                        Soviet foreign policy appears to be approaching a crossroads. Moscow's
                        position on Vietnam, for example, will be very much influenced by the
                        outcome of talks in Laos as well as by developments in other major East-West
                        problems such as disarmament and Berlin. Developments in any one of these
                        questions could affect policy toward the West as well as toward Communist
                        China.</p>

                    <p>In its relations with the Western powers, Moscow has continued to speak with
                        an indecisive voice. On the one hand, there are signs that Soviet <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0413"/>policies could shift to a more
                        militant line. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> dropped his
                        cordial tone and employed pointed criticism of US policy toward disarmament
                        in his letter of 21 February to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d165fn3">For text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v06">

                        reach agreement on questions of disarmament,” and that it had already
                        concluded that the 18-nation disarmament committee would fail in its task.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> directly charged the
                        US with an ulterior motive in proposing a meeting of foreign ministers at
                        Geneva in order to “neutralize” world opinion's “adverse reaction to the
                        resumption of nuclear tests by the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.” The harsher Soviet tone also was contained in key speeches by
                        Soviet military leaders on the occasion of Red Army Day.</p>
                    <p>While <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> apparently is
                        determined to gain a definite commitment from the West for a future heads of
                        government meeting, this approach does not rule out the achievement of
                        propaganda advantages from alleged Western disinterest in an immediate
                        top-level meeting on disarmament. The extensive Soviet propaganda campaign,
                        government statements and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s pronouncements are designed to provide the Soviet
                        Union with a justification for resuming its own test series at any time. As
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said in his letter:
                        “It is clear that the Soviet Union … will not want to be left behind and
                        will do everything to maintain its nuclear arsenal at the necessary
                        level.”</p>
                    <p>This strident campaign for a summit has nevertheless been offset by the wide
                        publicity given <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s prompt
                        congratulations on Colonel <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Glenn</persName>'s
                        successful flight and the Soviet leader's offer to cooperate with the US in
                        outer space.<note n="4" xml:id="d165fn4">For text of Khrushchev';s message,
                            February 21, see ibid., p. 96.</note> In addition, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has left the door open for a
                        foreign ministers' conference as proposed by the US and has stopped short of
                        announcing his intention of going to Geneva regardless of Western
                        participation—a move which would foreshadow an unabashed propaganda assault
                        on the US. Press reports from Moscow suggest that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will soon make his position
                        clear in a number of speeches and pronouncements containing new versions of
                        proposals on disarmament and European security. The scheduled World
                        Conference on Peace and Disarmament, to be held in Moscow in July, suggests
                        that the “peaceful coexistence” and disarmament themes will dominate the
                        Soviet line this spring, with its predictable effect on Sino-Soviet
                        relations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Berlin</p>
                    <p>The summit campaign has tended to overshadow the Berlin question, but the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may have reached new decisions in
                        this area. Almost immediately after his return to Moscow, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> met for two days with an East
                        German delegation headed by party First Secretary <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Walter Ulbricht</persName>. The short communiqué issued on 28 February
                        dealt mainly <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0414"/>with economic
                        questions and indicated further Soviet support for the East German
                            regime.<note n="5" xml:id="d165fn5">For reports of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s meeting with <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>, see <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>, March 1-3, 1962, and <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi>,
                            March 1-2, 1962.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>On the political side, the communiqué stated only that “an exchange of
                        opinions” occurred on the conclusion of “the German peace treaty and the
                        normalization of the situation in West Berlin on its basis.” While this
                        formula contains no sense of urgency and avoids any question of timing, it
                        is likely that the Soviets and East Germans have used the meeting to
                        coordinate a tactical line on these questions for the coming months. This
                        meeting, in the wake of more aggressive actions affecting access to Berlin,
                        also suggests that the bloc will begin to press forward on Berlin.</p>
                    <p>While Moscow has backed away from any showdown over Allied access, it has not
                        abandoned its maneuvering to undermine the four-power basis for air access
                        to Berlin. After a four-day respite, coinciding with a Soviet holiday, the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> resumed flights in the air
                        corridors and continued filing specific flight plans. Employment of this
                        tactic, rather than a return to the blanket reservations used earlier,
                        suggests that for the present Moscow is mainly interested in keeping its
                        position intact by periodically asserting a right to use the corridors at
                        times and places of its own choosing.</p>

                            762A.34/2-2662)</note> protesting that the West German customs law of 1
                        January provided for inclusion of West Berlin in the Federal Republic
                        customs system. This was labeled a “provocation” designed to create new
                        difficulties in “normalizing the situation in West Berlin on the basis of
                        conclusion of a German peace treaty.” The note included the standard claim
                        that the extension of West German legislation to West Berlin was “absolutely
                        illegal and beyond the competence of the Federal Republic.” The timing of
                        these protests, after almost two months' delay, suggests that it is a
                        further step toward driving a wedge between Bonn and its allies by raising
                        the issue of the incompatibility of the occupation status with West German
                        ties to Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Simultaneously, Soviet diplomats in Vienna have inspired reports in the
                        Western press that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is
                        prepared to make far-reaching concessions to <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> if bilateral talks are arranged. The Soviet
                        concessions would include incorporating West Berlin into the Federal
                        Republic, establishing a corridor for access, removing <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>, and eliminating the wall; in
                        return, Bonn would sign a peace treaty, recognize East Germany, <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0415"/>and accept the division of Berlin. Such
                        rumors are doubtless intended to provide an incentive for Bonn to explore
                        Soviet intentions in private talks. In the meantime, the Soviets apparently
                        will allow the talks with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> to stagnate.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sino-Soviet Relations</p>
                    <p>The Soviet leaders may also have decided to launch a new attack against the
                        Albanian leaders and by implication their Chinese Communist defenders. <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> on 21 February devoted two full pages to
                        articles and statements made several months earlier by leaders of other
                        Communist parties “supporting” the new Soviet party program and the course
                        established at the 22nd party congress. One of <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>'s two editorials tried, by citing Engels, to rebut Chou
                        En-lai's complaint that it was “un-Marxist” to attack another Communist
                        party—the Albanians. <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> warned that “only with
                        open and uncompromising criticism” of Albanian leaders Hoxha and Shehu can
                        unity of the Communist movement be preserved. This appeal, which apparently
                        is directed at the Asian parties, directly contradicts the Chinese view that
                        attacks on the Albanians disrupt unity. It probably is intended to prepare
                        the way for stepped-up criticism of Tirana.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> apparently is moving to
                        offset Chinese influence among other parties where it is strong, and the
                        first new step in this effort is toward Hanoi. A Soviet Communist party
                        delegation headed by party secretary Boris Ponomarev—and including Andrey
                        Andropov, head of the central committee's department for liaison with
                        foreign Communist parties—arrived in Hanoi on 21 February “at the
                        invitation” of the Vietnamese. Ponomarev was active during <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s behind-the-scenes assault on
                        the Rumanian party congress in June 1960 and will probably try to persuade
                        the Vietnamese leaders to reject Mao's challenge to Soviet leadership of the
                        international Communist movement and join the Soviet bloc in criticizing
                        Albania.</p>
                    <p>The Russians are reopening the issue of factions in the international
                        Communist movement—an issue presumably decided in favor of the Chinese at
                        the Moscow conference of Communist parties in late 1960. A Soviet
                        commentator on 24 February cited the British Communist party's criticism of
                        the idea of “freedom to form factions,” and <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> on
                        21 February reprinted part of Lenin's letter to the Austrian party stressing
                        the need to accept the “international discipline of the revolutionary
                        movement.” <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may be
                        preparing to use the issues of factions and dogmatism, possibly in his
                        report to the central committee plenum, as pretexts for criticizing Peiping
                        more openly.</p>

                    <p>On March 2, 1962, the President delivered a major radio and television
                        address on nuclear testing and disarmament. The United States had “long
                        urged an effective worldwide end to nuclear tests,”
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> declared, and in 1958 had joined the Soviet
                        Union in a nuclear test moratorium. The Soviet Union's breaking of the
                        moratorium in September 1961, however, had prompted his decision soon after
                        to resume underground tests and to begin preparations for atmospheric tests.
                        On March 2, following a careful review of the subject by the National
                        Security Council, he authorized the Atomic Energy Commission and the
                        Department of Defense to conduct a series of atmospheric tests, beginning
                        when preparations were completed in the latter part of April and to be
                        concluded as quickly as possible, within 2 to 3 months. Such series,
                        involving only those tests which could not be held underground, would take
                        place in the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean. For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States:

                        Adalbert de Segonzac of <hi rend="italic">France Soire</hi>, and Werner
                        Imhoof of the Swiss <hi rend="italic">Neue Zuercher Zeitung.</hi> They
                        observed <persName corresp="#p_BGN1">Bolshakov</persName> and I entering the
                        bar together.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BGN1">Bolshakov</persName> said he was about to
                        transmit my message to Moscow when he received a message from Moscow saying
                        the Soviet Government <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0417"/>no longer
                        thought the time was propitious for a <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> TV exchange. He said the
                        President's decision to resume nuclear testing<note n="2" xml:id="d167fn2">See <ref target="#d166">Document 166</ref>.</note> had caused the
                        Soviet Government to defer the program to a later date; that the Soviet
                        people would not understand why Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> appeared with the President in view of the
                        latter's testing decision. <persName corresp="#p_BGN1">Bolshakov</persName>
                        said this development did not affect my trip to the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_BGN1">Bolshakov</persName> I considered the
                        decision most unfortunate; that I could not see how the decision could not
                        but affect my trip; that it was a personal blow to the President as well as
                        for me; that, on the contrary, that in these difficult times we should
                        strive, in communications, to keep the lines open; it was always most
                        essential to communicate when our relations were improved. I told Bolshakov
                        I could not believe that he himself agreed with the Soviet Government
                        decision and I did not think there was anybody in the high ranks of the
                        Soviet Government who was naive enough to think that we would not test. I
                        said Mr. Khrushchev himself had made the statement that after the first
                        country tested it was natural to expect the other country to test.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGN1">Bolshakov</persName> said he was sorry about
                        it and that we had already accomplished a great deal in communications. I
                        told <persName corresp="#p_BGN1">Bolshakov</persName> that I had been able
                        to say, since January 20, 1961, that every commitment made with a Soviet
                        official regarding communications had been carried out to the fullest
                        extreme; that I had staked my personal reputation on <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>'s commitment to interview the
                        President. I told <persName corresp="#p_BGN1">Bolshakov</persName> I could
                        now no longer make this claim. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGN1">Bolshakov</persName> was obviously upset about the Soviet decision but
                        did not enter much into the conversation.</p>
                    <p>I left the Hay-Adams and returned to the White House where I reported to the
                        President, who was alone in the office. He immediately called
                            <persName>Sorensen</persName> who had prepared the draft TV remarks. The
                        President told me to call <persName corresp="#p_BGN1">Bolshakov</persName>
                        back and tell him this was another manifestation as to why it was so
                        difficult to come to any agreement with the Russians; that this particular
                        decision was as if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had
                        arranged for a Summit with the President and then cancelled out two days
                        prior to [it] because of some change in the political climate. The first
                        thought the President had was that I should immediately announce
                        cancellation of my Moscow trip in retaliation. On second thought he said we
                        would not do this because to do so would reduce the climate of
                        American-Soviet relations to an even lower point than now existed.</p>
                    <p>The President called Chip Bohlen and informed him of the Soviet decision;
                            <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> suggested that it be made
                        to appear as a joint one. I was thereupon instructed to call <persName corresp="#p_BGN1">Bolshakov</persName> back and tell him of the
                        President's <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0418"/>displeasure; point out
                        the difficulties with our own press because of the great many people who
                        knew of this matter, particularly the network heads; without further raising
                        of tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States we would attempt
                        to play down the decision. This I did.</p>

                    <p>On January 31, 1962, negotiations for a new U.S.-Soviet exchanges agreement
                        began in Washington. The U.S. delegation was headed by the Secretary of
                        State's Special Assistant, <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Charles E.
                            Bohlen</persName>, and the Soviet delegation by <persName corresp="#p_RSK1">S.K. Romanovsky</persName>, Deputy Chairman of the
                        Soviet Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. Following
                        prepared statements by the heads of delegation at the first plenary meeting
                        on January 31 and comments by each delegation on the draft agreement
                        submitted by the other on February 1, the delegations then split into four
                        committees devoted to general sections, scientific exchanges, performing
                        arts, and educational exchanges. As the talks progressed smaller meetings
                        between <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RSK1">Romanovsky</persName> occurred when discussion of
                        particular topics threatened to bring a halt to the negotiations. In general
                        the U.S. delegation tried to expand the number of exchanges in the
                        educational and informational fields, while the Soviet side attempted to
                        increase the numbers of exchanges in the scientific and industrial
                        areas.</p>
                    <p>By February 23 the discussions had progressed sufficiently far to warrant the
                        establishment of a drafting committee charged with preparing a paper that
                        showed what had been agreed and what remained to be resolved. Following this
                        meeting the delegations were able to reach agreement on all aspects of the
                        text and at their eleventh session on March 8, the drafting committee
                        compared the English and Russian texts and signed the agreement. For text of

                    <p>In a March 9, 1962, memorandum to Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> provided instructions for <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s upcoming meetings with Soviet Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in Geneva. “With
                        particular regard to Berlin,” the President stated, “you should attempt to
                        develop in your discussions with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> the draft proposal of a modus vivendi which has my
                        approval.” The draft modus vivendi to which the President referred called
                        for agreement by the Soviets to the general principle that “West Berlin
                        should be free to choose its own way of life, that its viability should be
                        maintained, and that its access should remain free and unhindered.” It also
                        called for further negotiations at the level of deputy foreign minister and
                        maintenance, for the time being, of current access procedures. For text of

                    <p>In a March 10 letter to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> responding to <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s letter
                        of February 15 (see <ref target="#d155">Document 155</ref>), Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> stated that the Soviet
                        Government was “prepared to meet halfway the desire expressed by you and to
                        agree to the creation of a special international organ on the access to West
                        Berlin.” <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> continued, “The
                        organ that I have in mind would act as an arbiter if difficulties appeared
                        during the practical implementation of the agreements on free access to and
                        from West Berlin. It would not be empowered with any administrative
                        functions which would give it authority to directly regulate traffic or set
                        its own regulations on the traffic routes connecting West Berlin with the
                        outside world because this is a prerogative of the German Democratic
                        Republic.” <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> indicated that
                        Soviet agreement on creation of such an organ would come only in the context
                        of an agreement to demilitarize Berlin and on “final legalization and
                        consolidation of the existing German borders and also on other questions
                        which are well known to you and which you mention in your message.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> added that “symbolic

                        could be stationed in West Berlin for 3-5 years. In telegram <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss> 5114-52 to Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, March 11, the President commented that
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s “proposal of an
                        international organ on access, though at present attached to a quite

                    <p rend="center">SOVIET MOTIVATIONS IN CANCELLATION OF TV EXCHANGE</p>
                    <p>1. In matters of this kind, the Soviet Union is not animated by any of the
                        normal personal considerations which might seem to us to be involved. The
                        Soviets undoubtedly consider that the time is not propitious in large
                        measure because of their propaganda reaction to our announcement of
                        resumption of tests. They undoubtedly feel it would be quite incompatible at
                        a time when Soviet propaganda was denouncing the President's speech as
                        “aggressive” or “atomic blackmail” to have an exchange of television
                        programs between the President and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                    <p>2. I would seriously doubt if there was any intention of affronting the
                        President if only because the agreement on this exchange has never been made
                        official, and from the Soviet side, there has been no leak at all. The leaks
                        from our side are, as you know, something they have complained about. But,
                        it does not fall in the category, in their eyes, of the renunciation of
                        something that was officially announced.</p>
                    <p>3. As additional proof that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        was not seeking to rebuff the President, is the fact that he is clearly
                        directing his policy towards bringing about a Summit meeting at Geneva. It
                        is likewise clear that the only person that he wishes to meet and talk to is
                        the President, since the Soviet Union is only always interested in going
                        where the power is, and, on the nuclear subject, there is only really one
                        other nuclear power, namely the United States. It would hardly make sense
                        for Khrushchev <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0421"/>avidly to seek a
                        meeting with the President on the one hand and on the other to go out of his
                        way to affront the President personally.</p>
                    <p>4. In short, given the fact of no announcement of the agreement, the Soviet
                        response to our resumption of testing, I think the Soviet suggestion to call
                        it off for the time being is quite sensible, and a further illustration of
                        the lack of considerations in the carrying out of their policies—to which we
                        perhaps attach greater importance. On policy matters, the Soviet Government

                    <p>In Geneva on March 19, 1962, Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> handed Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> a paper containing nine principles for
                        negotiations on Berlin that the former had drafted in response to their
                        discussion on March 12 (see <ref target="#d169">Document 169</ref>).
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> reported on the meeting in
                        telegram Secto 65 to the Department of State, March 19, noting that
                        “although some formulations are new and relate to our previous discussions,
                        paper as whole is essentially restatement in guise of principles of basic
                        Soviet position on Germany and Berlin it has developed over past three and
                        one-half years.” For text of telegram Secto 65, see <ref target="frus1961-63v15">

                    <p>The following day <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> argued in a
                        discussion with <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, as recorded in
                        the memorandum of conversation, that a solution to the Berlin issue “would
                        provide for: (1) a German peace treaty—perhaps without Western
                        participation, which would be regrettable; (2) a change in the abnormal
                        situation in West Berlin, a situation which had ensued from Germany's
                        surrender; and (3) a change in the situation with regard to respect for the
                        sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, which was now quite
                        intolerable.” <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> later in the
                        discussion explained the “vital interests” of the United States: “(1) our
                        presence in West Berlin; (2) freedom of access as it had been understood for
                        many years; and (3) freedom of West Berlin to choose its own way of life.”

                    <p>In further conversation on March 22, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> proposed that the two sides consider acknowledging that
                        they were unlikely to reach agreement on Berlin soon and “see how
                        disagreement should be handled.” <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> did not address the proposal directly, rather
                        emphasizing continuing Soviet patience in the effort to reach an
                        “understanding.” Yet another discussion on March 26 led to no progress. For

                        talks with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in Geneva,
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated that the “Soviets have
                        not changed their proposals in any significant way since Vienna summit.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had nevertheless
                        “carefully avoided threat and bluster on the one hand and any temptation to
                        declare an impasse on the other.” The Soviets “clearly left the impression
                        that they wished to continue talks on a bilateral basis and are flexible as
                        to exact means.” For text, see ibid., pages 91-92.</p>

                        issued on March 21, 1962, included the intelligence community's view that
                        Cuban military capabilities were “essentially defensive. We believe it
                        unlikely that the Bloc will provide Cuba with strategic weapon systems or
                        with air and naval capabilities suitable for major independent military
                        operations overseas. We also believe it unlikely that the Bloc will station
                        in Cuba combat units of any description, at least for the period of this
                        estimate [“over the next year or so”]. This attitude will not preclude the
                        liberal provision of Bloc advisers, instructors, and service personnel, the
                        provision of such defensive weapons and equipment as surface-to-air missiles
                        and radars, and such improvement of Cuban naval and air facilities as would
                        enable them to service Soviet units.” For text of the estimate's summary and

                    <p>Three weeks later, on April 10, the Chairman of the Board of National
                        Estimates, <persName corresp="#p_KS1">Sherman Kent</persName>, forwarded to
                        Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> an estimate on “Probable Reactions to a US Military
                        Intervention in Cuba.” Among other things, the estimate expressed the view
                        that the “<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would have no means to
                        intervene effectively in Cuba with its own forces, and almost certainly
                        would not resort to general war for the sake of the Castro regime. However,
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would exert every means of
                        political and psychological pressure at its disposal to procure a universal
                        condemnation of US aggression against Cuba, and, if possible, a restoration
                        of the status quo ante. To this end, it might make threatening references to
                        Soviet missile power. Communist China and other Bloc states would support
                        these Soviet efforts. In the circumstances, there would probably be a
                        first-class war scare, with panic among the neutralists and a high state of
                        alarm in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.” For text, see ibid., pages

                    <p>On March 28, 1962, during a National Security Council meeting, Secretary of
                        State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> reported to the President
                        on the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Conference still underway in Geneva.
                        According to the minutes of the meeting, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated that “on testing, it was utterly clear that the
                        Soviets would accept no inspection in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, in any way, shape or form. They had made this position
                        plain in public and in private; <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had told the Secretary privately that even one
                        foreigner loose in the Soviet Union could find things out that would be most
                        damaging to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. There seemed no room
                        to negotiate on this point.” Turning to the problem of general disarmament,
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that “the Soviets had
                        brought in a complete treaty covering complete disarmament by stages. But
                        the Soviet position clearly allows only for inspection of disarmament and
                        not for retained armaments.” For text of the minutes, see <ref target="frus1961-63v07">

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> remarked he had
                        seen Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> before his
                        departure from Moscow and that the Chairman had asked him to convey his best
                        wishes to the President. The President thanked him and then remarked with
                        regard to Laos that he considered the agreement reached with Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> at Vienna on this
                        subject as still valid; that we had been trying, not entirely with complete
                        success, to achieve a Laos settlement along the lines of that agreement;
                        that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> had recently
                        had some intensive discussions in Laos to this end and that it was important
                        that during our efforts to achieve a final settlement, the cease-fire should
                        be observed. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        assured the President that the Soviet Government considered the Vienna
                        agreement on Laos still valid.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he thought his views on meeting at the summit were
                        well known; that summit meetings where four or five were involved were
                        complicated matters; that people expected from a summit meeting some
                        positive accord. On the other hand, the President continued, it was possible
                        in informal meetings such as at Vienna to exchange views and it was not
                        necessary to expect that any agreement or accord on specific matters come
                        from such informal meetings. The Ambassador said that he understood the
                        President's views on this question.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the postponement of the exchange of television interviews, the
                        President expressed the hope that the near future might bring an opportune
                        moment to revive the exchange to which the Ambassador assented.</p>

                        with a summit or bilaterally for the following reasons:<note n="2" xml:id="d175fn2">Next to this paragraph in the source text <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> wrote “if some prospect of

                    </p>
                    <p>Our two principal problems with the Soviets are Berlin and disarmament. I
                        believe these are somewhat connected in Soviet thinking. A Berlin settlement
                        would facilitate progress in disarmament and one of the reasons <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may be holding off on Berlin is
                        to see whether or not there is any real prospect of meaningful disarmament
                        measures. In any event progress in disarmament would also facilitate a
                        Berlin settlement. While I continue to believe that a real settlement of the
                        Berlin question is not now possible I think that if Khrushchev thought the
                        prospects in the field of disarmament were good, we could reach agreement
                        with him on some kind of modus vivendi for Berlin. It seems to me that
                        continuance of the present situation of Soviet harassment and attempts to
                        erode our position in Berlin is very dangerous and could easily lead to a
                        situation where communication between us would become impossible. If the
                        Soviets proceed with the signature of their separate peace treaty without a
                        prior understanding with us the situation will become even more dangerous. I
                        believe therefore that we should proceed promptly to get out of the present
                        impasse.</p>
                    <p>Given the situation within the Soviet Union <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> should want—rather desperately—to at least stop
                        the increase in arms expenditure and if possible to reduce this burden
                        drastically. It is clear that he is in deep trouble with the Soviet
                        agricultural situation and will need to make heavy direct investments in
                        this area as well as to increase production of consumers goods to provide
                        needed incentives both in agriculture and industry. The problem is from what
                        area can he take these measures. Housing is already behind plan and the
                        pressure is already strong in this field. A cutback in heavy industry would
                        encounter strong internal opposition and would mean giving up the goals of
                        the seven-year plan. Foreign <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0426"/>aid
                        and space programs would be difficult to cut back and would probably not be
                        sufficient. The only area where the cuts could be made without causing
                        serious internal difficulties is that of military expenditures.</p>
                    <p>I believe that when they have seriously considered our proposal of a 30% cut
                        combined with a sampling technique, the Soviets will be very much attracted
                        to the possibilities it offers toward the solution of their problems. The
                        greatest opposition would come from the Soviet military and their strongest
                        argument is probably that even with sampling we would uncover their
                        weaknesses and be able to fix targets with sufficient accuracy that we would
                        be tempted either to launch a first strike or make political demands based
                        upon a “position of strength.”</p>
                    <p>In these circumstances I believe that the disclosure to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> of our present intelligence
                        capability could be the item which could tip the scale both in disarmament
                        and Berlin. The pros and cons of this action would have to be carefully
                        examined. I understand that the military and CIA are strongly opposed
                        particularly to revealing the extent of resolution of our photography but I
                        do not believe this would be necessary. I suggest that the President should
                        see <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> with only an
                        interpreter present and should relate the disclosure solely to disarmament
                        and not to the Berlin question. He could pick an area where the Soviets
                        would know there had been no <gloss target="#t_U21">U-2</gloss> flights or
                        visits from our attaches. He could produce maps showing targets in that area
                        and drawings of military and particularly of missile installations. An
                        alternative might be to show <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> similar information about Communist Chinese
                        atomic and missile developments. It would be helpful if in the conversation
                        it could be brought out that our decision to stand firm on Berlin antedated
                        this intelligence capability.</p>
                    <p>I have an appointment to see the President on Friday at 10:30 and if you
                        agree I would propose to talk to him along these lines.<note n="3" xml:id="d175fn3">The source text bears an “OK DR”, but other than an

                    <p>In an April 4, 1962, memorandum to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, Ambassador to India John Kenneth Galbraith urged
                        that Assistant Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> “be instructed to approach the Russians to express
                        our concern about the increasingly dangerous situation that the Viet Cong is
                        forcing in Southeast Asia. They should be told of our determination not to
                        let the Viet Cong overthrow the present government while at the same time to
                        look without relish on the dangers that this military build-up is causing in
                        the area. The Soviets should be asked to ascertain whether Hanoi can and
                        will call off the Viet Cong activity in return for phased American
                        withdrawal, liberalization in the trade relations between the two parts of
                        the country and general and non-specific agreement to talk about
                        reunification after some period of tranquillity.” In a memorandum to the

                    <p>Moscow continues to evince interest in further high-level negotiations with
                        the United States on the Berlin problem and to avoid actions which might
                        lead to a confrontation with the West. The suspension of Soviet flights in

                        actions will be restrained, at least pending further developments in
                        negotiations. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has shifted its
                        attention to efforts to restrict and erode Western rights in ground travel
                        to and within Berlin and to curtail or terminate the Western Military
                        Liaison Missions in East Germany.</p>
                    <p>Moscow's treatment of the <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> talks at
                        Geneva has featured reports from US papers which are said to have emphasized
                        the fact that the two major powers agreed to continue negotiations on the
                        German problem through normal diplomatic channels. Moscow <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss>, in its brief coverage of the 29 March
                        news conference, carefully noted President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s remarks on Berlin concerning the “urgency and
                        importance of this problem” and his assertion that the US “wants to have
                        these talks in order to avoid a dangerous situation.”</p>
                    <p>Although there has been no further elaboration by the bloc on its proposal
                        for the creation of a four-power “arbitration agency” to ensure Western
                        access to West Berlin, East European satellite representatives are
                        reportedly actively seeking neutralist support for the proposal. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of 2-column source text not declassified</hi>]
                        several East European embassies have recently approached the Indian
                        Government in the hopes of obtaining a favorable endorsement of the
                        Communist proposal. The Czech representative even suggested that Indian
                        troops might be stationed in Berlin in place of Soviet and American troops.
                        The bloc has made it clear, however, that any Berlin settlement must also
                        recognize the termination of existing Western occupation rights. A 4 April
                            <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> attack on the US radio station in West
                        Berlin (RIAS) may signal more direct Soviet propaganda attacks against the
                        West's occupation status in West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>The pattern of Soviet flights in the air corridors over the past three weeks
                        suggests that Moscow is satisfied with the limited gains achieved thus far
                        and does not contemplate any major new moves on air access in the near
                        future. Soviet tactics in the corridors from the start have been closely
                        linked with Moscow's broader objective of obtaining some sort of new
                        settlement on the status of West Berlin and access to the city which could
                        be interpreted as de facto Western recognition of East German sovereignty.
                        Toward this end Moscow sought to establish its right to use the corridors on
                        a basis of complete equality with the West and consequently to undermine the
                        original purpose of the corridors as channels for unrestricted Western
                        access.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets apparently believe that if they can extend bloc control in the
                        corridors and bring air access procedures more into line with those involved
                        in ground access, the bloc will be in a stronger bargaining position for
                        demanding new access arrangements which would “respect” East German
                        sovereignty. Soviet activities both in the air corridors and on the ground
                        routes are also aimed at preparing for an eventual transfer to the East
                        Germans of controls over all forms of access.</p>
                    <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0429"/>
                    <p>Recent Soviet moves involving the US and British Military Liaison Missions in
                        East Germany may reflect a desire to terminate the missions altogether, in
                        line with the Soviet contention that they are anachronisms left over from
                        the period of the military occupation of Germany. The Soviets have rescinded
                        their order placing the chief of the US Military Liaison Mission (USMLM) in
                        Potsdam under virtual house arrest and are again allowing USMLM personnel
                        free travel to and from West Berlin. The official East German news agency,
                        however, announced earlier that USMLM personnel will not be allowed to
                        travel in East Germany without the express approval of the Soviet
                        authorities. Soviet Marshal Konev has rejected Allied protests over the
                        treatment of mission personnel by the East German police, and may attempt to
                        impose even sharper restrictions on mission activities. The Soviets
                        apparently hope to force the US to withdraw its missions. Alternatively, the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could propose to the three Western
                        powers the termination of all four missions and unilaterally withdraw the
                        Soviet mission from Frankfurt.</p>
                    <p>In a further effort to test Western reaction to their new customs law prior
                        to its full implementation—reportedly on 30 April—the East Germans have
                        apparently decided to introduce new crossing procedures on the East-West
                        Berlin sector borders. On 2 April, long-term entry passes held by numerous
                        individuals engaged in interzonal trade and by West Berliners working in
                        East Berlin were taken up, and the holders were advised to secure new
                        passes. The East Germans are reliably reported to have assured a West German
                        trade official that the new customs law will not affect interzonal trade or
                        trade between West Berlin and West Germany, but they may be laying the
                        groundwork for separating West Berlin commercial contacts with East Germany
                        from those between East and West Germany.</p>

                    <p>Since the departure of the foreign ministers from Geneva, the nuclear test

                        subcommittee discussions of the test ban issue, Soviet delegates have
                        continued to reiterate the standard argument that a test ban agreement is
                        possible only on the basis of the 28 November Soviet draft proposal,<note n="3" xml:id="d177fn3">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on

                    <p>On 3 April Moscow issued another formal pronouncement warning that if Western
                        nuclear testing continues, the USSR “will be compelled to hold tests of new
                        types of nuclear weapons” to strengthen its security and safeguard universal
                        peace. This latest warning—contained in a government <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0430"/>note<note n="4" xml:id="d177fn4">For text,

                        of US atmospheric tests will inevitably give a “new impetus” to the
                        perfection of mass destruction weapons.</p>
                    <p>In a further attempt to justify an eventual Soviet test resumption, the
                        Soviet press has distorted recent statements by President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>—commenting on possible US use of
                        nuclear weapons in a hypothetical situation in which Soviet conventional
                        forces would be overrunning Western Europe—to imply that the President had
                        advocated preventive war. <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> went beyond Moscow's
                        usual line—which consistently denounces the Pentagon and US “militarists,”
                        but generally stops short of implicating the President personally—and
                        remarked that “it seems that the President is himself taking the position of
                        the most belligerent part of the Pentagon brass.”</p>
                    <p>The criticism was diluted somewhat by the interjection of bitter side attacks
                        on US “monopolist” and “militarist” circles. The Soviets were also careful
                        not to imply that the President himself no longer advocated peaceful
                        settlement of outstanding East-West issues, such as Berlin and Germany.</p>

                    <p>According to the minutes of a White House meeting on April 6, 1962, Secretary
                        of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> told President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> that “there was an urgent need to
                        provide the U.S. delegation at Geneva with an outline of our proposed treaty
                        for general and complete disarmament. He noted that the Soviet delegation
                        had already tabled a draft treaty and that there was considerable pressure
                        on our delegation to begin a detailed discussion of the Soviet document.”
                        The President asked “why it was that we were not further along with the
                        treaty draft at this point since we presumably had been working on it for
                        the past several months.” <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">William
                            Foster</persName>, Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency,
                        replied that “the most basic substantive issue to be resolved was the manner
                        in which reductions of armaments and limitations on production could be
                        controlled.” The President asked that a small interagency task force be
                        formed to prepare a final draft of the treaty. For text of the minutes, see

                    <p>At a luncheon conversation today <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> raised the question of the Alsop article and the
                        stir this had caused in Moscow.<note n="2" xml:id="d179fn2">“<persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s Grand Strategy,” <hi rend="italic">Saturday Evening Post</hi>, March 31, 1962. In this article Stewart
                            Alsop, basing his remarks on an interview with the President, wrote that
                            in some circumstances the United States might employ a first
                            strike.</note> He said they had been particularly upset about the timing
                        of the article. I explained that the <hi rend="italic">Saturday Evening
                            Post</hi> had a lead time of, I thought, something in the neighborhood
                        of five weeks. He said he thought that surely in an article of this
                        importance the article could have been changed in order not to be related to
                        the discussions of the Berlin problem. I said I was sure that this was not
                        possible since the Post was published in millions of copies and I also felt
                        certain that no one had really considered at the time the interview was
                        given what the situation might be at the time it was published. I explained
                        that the way these things usually work, as far as I understand them, was
                        that the President would give an interview and that the text might be
                        checked by the President's staff in the White House, but probably not by him
                        personally.</p>
                    <p>I expressed the opinion that one of our difficulties in relations between the
                        United States and the Soviet Union was their tendency to read into press
                        stories policy indications that were actually non-existent. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he knew of the frequent
                        and close contact the President had with the press, and he was therefore
                        inclined to take press stories as much more indicative of the President's
                        policy than was the case with President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>. I pointed out that there were a great many
                        people who talked to the press besides the President and that this tendency
                        to read Government policy implications into press stories was a great
                        mistake, since a great many press stories had absolutely no relation to
                        government policy.</p>
                    <p>I said I thought there was one area in which he could greatly improve over
                        previous practice, and that was that when he was in doubt about what some
                        press story or government action meant, he should <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0432"/>contact appropriate officials in the State
                        Department and informally get their opinions. I said that, from my
                        observations, the Soviets tended to read into instances policy implications
                        which did not exist, and that very often there was a simple explanation
                        which our people will be glad to give him. He expressed surprise that he
                        could ask for this kind of information and said he was somewhat put off by
                        the fact that every time he called at the State Department, it turned out to
                        be a big operation with the press waiting for him when he left. I explained
                        that this was inevitable but that there was no need for him to make any
                        substantive comment and that, after a while, the press would become used to
                        this, although they would always be there in case he had something to
                            say.<note n="3" xml:id="d179fn3">During the luncheon conversation
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> also asked <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>'s advice about contacts with

                    <p>The Soviet press and radio promptly denounced the 10 April joint US-British
                            statement<note n="2" xml:id="d180fn2">On April 9 the U.S. and U.K.
                            Governments sent a joint statement on nuclear testing to the Soviet
                            Government that reiterated their view that international inspection or
                            verification inside the Soviet Union was required in any nuclear test
                            ban treaty in order to determine the nature of unexplained seismic
                            events which might be nuclear tests. For text, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1962</hi>, vol. I, pp. 292-293.</note> on
                        a nuclear test ban as a “face-saving maneuver” issued at a time when the US
                        is completing preparations for atmospheric tests. A 12 April <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> article termed it an “ultimatum” and “typical
                        nuclear blackmail.” At the 12 April session of the Geneva disarmament
                        conference, <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0433"/>Soviet chief delegate
                        Zorin similarly denounced the joint statement and pledged that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would not stage tests during the
                        disarmament negotiations if the West would make a similar pledge. There have
                        been indications that the Soviets might follow this bid for a test
                        moratorium with a proposal ostensibly designed to break the impasse over
                        international controls to monitor a test ban.</p>
                    <p>Soviet representatives at Geneva recently have hinted at the possibility of
                        some agreement in principle to international controls over a test ban. [<hi rend="italic">15 lines of 2-column source text not

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> probably expects that the US will
                        resume testing, and the advanced state of readiness of the Soviet test site
                        at Novaya Zemlya suggests that the Soviets will do likewise after the first
                        few US explosions and the anticipated neutralist condemnation. Soviet
                        delegate <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> at the disarmament
                        conference and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in a recent
                        letter to the Japanese prime minister have reiterated the standard argument
                        that US control proposals for a test ban would amount to an “espionage
                        network” on Soviet territory.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet delegation at Geneva has continued to seek to present the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as the champion of general and complete
                        disarmament and to maintain publicly that a test ban agreement is possible
                        only under the terms of the Soviet November 1961 draft treaty, which
                        excludes international controls.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets are also attempting to impress the neutralist delegations with
                        their stand on partial disarmament measures. In urging the adoption of the
                        Soviet draft on banning war propaganda, <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> charged that the US has systematically suppressed
                        peace propaganda and outlawed a number of organizations in favor of peace.
                        The Soviets have capitalized on the fact that the US has not yet presented a
                        draft treaty on general and complete disarmament, and neutralist delegations
                        are reportedly surprised at US failure to do so and are voicing suspicions
                        that the US does not want to present any general disarmament proposals,
                        “despite many official US statements supporting this goal.”</p>

                    <p>At a meeting of the National Security Council on April 18, 1962, the
                        President approved the nuclear atmospheric test series proposed by the

                        1962. The resulting test series, called Dominic I, ultimately consisted of
                        36 detonations held in the Pacific Ocean area from April 25 to November 3,
                        1962. The first 27 were held in the vicinity of Christmas Island in the
                        spring and summer. The remaining 9 tests, approved by President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> at a meeting of the National

                        least one bout with influenza followed by a long recuperative vacation on
                        the Black Sea has become an annual event. He was ill with flu in early
                        January of this year, and evidently had another attack in April which
                        necessitated a postponement of the opening Supreme Soviet session from 10 to
                        23 April.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has a history of other
                        medical problems which are at least a potential source of concern. He is
                        dangerously heavy, for instance: only five feet, five inches tall, he weighs
                        about 220 pounds and measures 49 inches around the waist. For some years he
                        has had kidney trouble, and there are numerous reports that he suffers from
                        high blood pressure and a liver ailment. He does not appear to be
                        particularly respectful of professional medical advice.</p>
                    <p>The other leaders carry on quietly during <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s extended absences from Moscow, and as yet there
                        has not been any noticeable increase in political maneuvering within the
                        party presidium in preparation for a succession crisis. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> himself gives every indication
                        of being in full command; speculation that he is still involved in a fight
                        to maintain his position seems to be unfounded. However, there probably
                        continue to be disagreements within the hierarchy over such questions as the
                        proportion of economic resources that should be devoted to consumer goods
                        and the pace and extent of liberalization in the wake of renewed attacks
                        against Stalin.</p>
                    <p>When <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is away from the
                        capital, party secretary <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName> and
                        Deputy Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> seem to have
                        the primary “caretaker” responsibilities for party and government affairs,
                        respectively. <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName>, however, does
                        not receive the preferential treatment that might be expected for someone
                        who has been designated first lieutenant and eventual successor.</p>
                    <p>It is still unclear how some of the responsibilities at the top are being
                        divided since the personnel shifts at the party congress in October. This is
                            <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0436"/>particularly true in the
                        ideological and propaganda fields, with <persName corresp="#p_SMA1">Suslov</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Kuusinen</hi>, Ilichev, and
                        Ponomarev now all members of the party secretariat. Friction and jockeying
                        in this area seem likely.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>We have been reviewing our restrictions on the travel of Soviet citizens in
                        this country in the hope of finding a new approach which would strengthen
                        our political and propaganda posture without damage to our essential
                        security needs.</p>
                    <p>Our restrictions were imposed in 1952 as a means of retaliating against
                        long-standing restrictions on the travel of American citizens in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Originally they involved prior
                        notification of intent to travel and were applied only to Soviet officials.
                        They were extended in 1955 to all Soviet citizens other than those who are
                        members of the United Nations Secretariat and closed zones, modeled on those
                        in existence in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, were also
                        established. This followed adoption by the National Security Council of NSC
                        5427 which provided that “restrictions should be placed upon diplomatic and
                        official representatives of Soviet bloc countries in the United States on
                        the basis of strict reciprocity for restrictions placed upon United States
                        representatives in each Soviet bloc country.”<note n="2" xml:id="d184fn2">Regarding NSC 5427, July 15, 1954, see <ref target="frus1952-54v08">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952-1954, vol. VIII, pp.
                                1238-1246</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>In 1957 the United States proposed to the Soviet Government that closed zones
                        be abolished on a basis of reciprocity. Subsequently, we have repeated that
                        proposal several times and have also suggested partial elimination, again on
                        a reciprocal basis. The Soviet Government has never replied officially to
                        these proposals.</p>
                    <p>Our review has indicated that our previous efforts to use our travel
                        restrictions as a bargaining lever with which to exert pressure for a
                        lessening of Soviet restrictions have become increasingly ineffectual in
                        terms <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0437"/>of the exchange program. The
                        travel restrictions were adopted several years before the first exchange
                        agreement was signed in 1958. Despite our best efforts, our rationale for
                        the restrictions has been either largely misunderstood or not appreciated by
                        that segment of the American public concerned with exchanges. Furthermore,
                        we have not been able to extract a significant number of exceptions from the
                        Soviets to their own closed area regulations. Actually, during the course of
                        the past year or so, the Soviets have become increasingly adamant regarding
                        exceptions. We have tried ourselves to adopt a stricter attitude, but we
                        find ourselves on a number of occasions making exceptions in order to
                        achieve our over-all goals of maximum usefulness for each exchange. In so
                        doing, however, we vitiate the basis of our closed area policy which is
                        retaliation for Soviet restrictions in the hope that the Soviet authorities
                        might be induced at least to grant reciprocal exceptions or possibly to
                        liberalize or even eventually abolish their restrictions.</p>
                    <p>We have come to the conclusion that the travel restrictions no longer serve
                        our interests so far as Soviet visitors are concerned. We are, therefore,
                        recommending the abolition of the travel restrictions for exchange visitors
                        and tourists. We would retain adequate controls on Soviet travel in this
                        country by continuing present arrangements among the Departments concerned.
                        In this way itineraries of Soviet exchange visitors and tourists would be
                        coordinated and approved in advance as before. In the case of long-term
                        Soviet visitors, we would keep the advance notification requirement to
                        enable the Departments of State and Justice to remain aware of the movements
                        of such individuals. We have consulted with the Departments of Defense and
                        Justice and with the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.<note n="3" xml:id="d184fn3">Regarding the letters to the Department of Defense and
                            Justice and the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, June 9, 1961, see
                                <ref target="#d75fn6">footnote 6, Document 75</ref>. In replies
                            dated June 16 and 28, 1961, the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and
                            Department of Defense raised some concerns about lifting the
                            restrictions, but stated that it was basically a matter for the
                            Department of State to determine. (Department of State, Central Files,
                            601.6111/6-1661 and 6-2861) Apparently no reply was received from the
                            Department of Justice, because on February 15, 1962. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> again wrote to the Attorney General
                            about lifting the travel restrictions and specifically referred to his
                            June 9 letter. (Ibid., 601.6111/2-2062) In reply to this letter, on
                            March 27 Attorney General <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>
                            agreed to lift the restrictions if <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> determined that it would be to the net advantage of
                            the United States. (Ibid., 511.613/3-2762)</note> They have concurred in
                        our recommendation on the basis of the Department's assessment that the
                        over-all effect would be to our net advantage and that the control
                        arrangements mentioned above be continued. We propose to retain the closed
                        area system for resident Soviet officials for internal security reasons and
                        in order to maintain our bargaining position for our own officials in the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. We also feel that the closed area
                        system should continue to apply to Soviet correspondents accredited in the
                        United States. In view of the stringent restrictions and often provocative
                        treatment to which our correspondents in the Soviet Union are subject, we do
                        not feel we can justify waiving <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0438"/>restrictions on Soviet correspondents at this time. Our feeling is
                        re-enforced by the highly distorted reporting engaged in by Soviet
                        correspondents in this country. If we are able to obtain greater
                        opportunities for dissemination of American views in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and if the lot of our correspondents
                        improves, we might wish to reconsider this point.</p>
                    <p>We consider that removal of the travel restrictions on Soviet visitors would
                        have significant and positive advantages for us, primarily with that segment
                        of the American public concerned with exchanges. Such a move would in all
                        probability result in still greater support of the exchanges program by
                        American scientists and by American universities. At the same time, we could
                        without difficulty assure the public that adequate security controls are
                        being retained. With regard to the Soviet Government, we would present this
                        change as a modest step in improving relations and as in keeping with the
                        hopes expressed at the time of the signing of the recently concluded
                        exchanges agreement regarding broadening of channels of communication
                        between peoples in both countries. We would invite the Soviet Government to
                        respond to our initiative, although the likelihood of a positive response is
                        not great. Our approach would be sufficiently restrained so that it would
                        not be regarded by the Soviets as another evidence of what they consider to
                        be espionage mania or another propaganda gimmick against them.</p>
                    <p>If you concur in our recommendation to abolish the travel restrictions for
                        Soviet exchange visitors and tourists, the Department will plan to send a
                        note to the Soviet Embassy within the next month or two. The exact timing
                        would depend on the then current international situation. Given the present
                        status of our discussions with the Soviets on a number of international
                        issues, we do not believe in the immediate abolition of these restrictions.
                        Since our primary motivation in doing away with the restrictions is a
                        domestic one, we would not favor, however, indefinitely postponing these
                        changes. In any event, I would plan to advise you before a note is
                            sent.<note n="4" xml:id="d184fn4">On May 2 <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> informed <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> that the President had approved the lifting of

                    <p>The President said the Prime Minister and he had discussed the possibility of
                        a summit. The Prime Minister commented that a summit hangs on what had just
                        been said about nuclear testing and disarmament. He was doubtful of the
                        value of having a summit if nothing happens. It would be a propaganda
                        exercise. All the pressures would be on us because of our public. We had
                        been thinking about a summit on Berlin, but this raised the problem too
                        high. However, we should not lose contact with this “strange character”.</p>
                    <p>The President explained that both the Prime Minister and he were in agreement
                        that there is really no sense in a summit unless there could be agreement in
                        some important area, perhaps Berlin or nuclear testing. We would be at a
                        disadvantage. There were three of us and only one of them. <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0440"/>There was some advantage in a bilateral
                        meeting in the summer or fall. We should keep this possibility open. A
                        summit would be warranted either in case of a crisis or if an agreement was
                        in prospect. A bilateral meeting was an alternative. The Prime Minister and
                        he were in agreement that it was not right to have a bilateral meeting
                        now.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister suggested that nuclear testing might be the subject of a
                        summit meeting since agreement would never be worked out at the Geneva
                        conferences, complicated by the presence of neutrals. He had the feeling
                        that the only way to do a deal is directly with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. The Secretary recalled that in his recent speech
                        on Berlin,<note n="2" xml:id="d185fn2">The text of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s speech to the Supreme Soviet
                            on April 24 is printed in <hi rend="italic">Pravda,</hi> April 25,
                            1962.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had indicated the Russians
                        might be leading to a meeting of heads of government. We ourselves had
                        played this theme a bit. The Prime Minister said that we must think of the
                        communiqué that would come out at the end of a summit meeting.</p>
                    <p>At one point during the meeting the Prime Minister said <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> seemed to be in a curious mood.
                        He was talking now at length to anyone who went to see him. If he took a
                        position as he did on Laos at Vienna, it would influence the whole Russian
                        bureaucracy. The whole thing changes at a word from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. The thing is to get to him. If
                        we made up our minds to make another effort on nuclear testing we should
                        consider seeing him. It is no good trying to persuade junior people. If the
                        word comes from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> they will
                        have to work the problem out. When he gives an order he carries the entire
                        structure with him. The Prime Minister agreed on the dangers of a meeting of
                        three or four of us. An opportunity could be created to see Khrushchev at
                        Geneva or the U.N.</p>
                    <p>Reverting at another point to the question of a summit, the President said
                        that he did not know of any labor agreement that had come about except as
                        the result of an offer at the last minute to the top level. An agreement
                        could result from a summit or maybe it could be reached at a bilateral
                        meeting. The Prime Minister suggested that such a meeting would provide an
                        opportunity for talks also about other matters in addition to the ostensible
                        subject of the meeting. The President again mentioned the awkwardness of a
                        meeting with three on our side and one on theirs. Perhaps it would be better
                        for the Prime Minister, <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De Gaulle</persName> or
                        himself to see <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        bilaterally.</p>

                    <p>This writer had lunch on Tuesday, May 1, 1962 with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> at the Soviet Embassy. Also present were Enver
                        Mamedov of the Novosty News Agency and <persName corresp="#p_BGN1">Georgi
                            Bolshakov</persName>, Editor of <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        Magazine. The early part of the luncheon was taken up with non-political
                        pleasantries and in the hope that my trip to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might better <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-USA
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>After the departure of Mamedov, the Ambassador became serious and launched
                        into a discussion of his own relationship with the Soviet Government. He
                        said that it was very important to him to report accurately to Moscow the
                        views of this Administration on a variety of subjects. Sometimes, he said,
                        he had to rely on the newspapers for these views; that this source was not
                        always accurate.</p>
                    <p>He said he would like to improve on this feature of his ambassadorship; he
                        would like to have informal contacts with the President if the President so
                        desired. He said the relationship would be very informal and he would be
                        prepared to meet at any time and at any place with the President to discuss
                        any subject.</p>
                    <p>He was also interested in how Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> could make contact with Mrs.
                            <persName>Kennedy</persName>. Prior to leaving the Soviet Union he had a
                        telephone call from <persName corresp="#p_KMA1">Mikhail Kharlamov</persName>
                        who had received a copy of the TV film of the White House tour which Mrs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had been invited to see
                        with Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_KMA1">Kharlamov</persName>. They both
                        enjoyed this tour very much and he said that Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was anxious to meet Mrs.
                            <persName>Kennedy</persName> without causing embarrassment to Mrs.
                            <persName>Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he understood the
                        political problems of this country.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said he would like to establish some rapport with other
                        members of the Administration: <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName>,
                        Ted Sorensen, Schlesinger, Kissinger.<note n="2" xml:id="d186fn2"> Henry
                            Kissinger was a part-time consultant to the National Security Council
                            during 1961.</note> He said if he was in touch with these people on a
                        regular basis there was less of a chance of sending inaccurate reports to
                        Moscow. He has the desire to send completely accurate reports to Moscow even
                        though he cannot guarantee Soviet reaction to them but that he was
                        determined not to send home just what the government wanted to hear but what
                        the actual views were.</p>
                    <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0442"/>
                    <p>He said he was just feeling his way in this country but that anything which
                        could be done to insure his receiving accurate information would be highly
                        appreciated. I told him I was certain our government wanted him to have
                        accurate information particularly since we felt that he had the confidence
                        of the Soviet government. The Ambassador told me that personally during the
                        previous ambassadorial administration here, <persName corresp="#p_BGN1">Georgi Bolshakov</persName> was used as a go-between because we did not
                        have the confidence of getting accurate information to Moscow; and in some
                        cases that would continue to be true; but that now he was available to enjoy
                        that same confidence.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked if I would have a

                    <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                    <p>To estimate probable Soviet courses of action in foreign policy over the next
                        year or so and to examine some factors affecting the Soviet outlook on
                        international politics over a longer period.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>1. Despite attacks on the general line of Soviet foreign policy by the
                        Chinese and other Communists over the last two years or so, and despite some
                        disappointment with the results of that line on the part of the Soviets <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0443"/>themselves, we believe that the
                        general principles and tactical methods of Soviet foreign policy are likely
                        to be continued for some time to come. (Paras. 10-12, 43-46, 62)</p>
                    <p>2. The Soviet leaders retain basic confidence in their
                        ideologically-motivated belief that the Communist system is destined to
                        prevail worldwide. But the aggressive quality of their policies derived from
                        this belief will continue to be limited by their full appreciation of the
                        dangers of general nuclear war, and their unwillingness to run serious risks
                        of such a conflict. This does not mean, however, that the Soviets would
                        always estimate such risks correctly nor that they would abandon vital
                        interests to avoid them. (Paras. 13-17)</p>
                    <p>3. Soviet tactics of struggle under the slogan of “peaceful coexistence” rest
                        on two basic assumptions: (a) that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s economic system will demonstrate its superiority and
                        increasingly give it a power advantage; and (b) that the “masses,” first in
                        the underdeveloped and former colonial countries but ultimately in advanced
                        Western states also, will increasingly join the Communists in the struggle
                        to overthrow the “system of Western imperialism.” (Paras. 25, 42-46)</p>
                    <p>4. The greater stress placed by the Soviets in the last year or two on wars
                        of “national liberation” is in part a response to Chinese criticism that the
                        Soviets were magnifying the dangers of war with the West and underplaying
                        the necessary role of violence. Despite these Chinese pressures, the USSR
                        has not given full political and material support or committed its prestige
                        to all armed anti-Western movements in the underdeveloped areas. We believe
                        that the Soviets will continue to follow an opportunistic policy in this
                        regard. (Paras. 21-22)</p>
                    <p>5. Although the Soviets are unlikely, as a matter of general policy, to use
                        their own forces to achieve local gains, they might do so in some area
                        adjacent to Bloc territory if they judged that the political circumstances
                        were favorable and believed that the West would not make an effective
                        military response. They would probably employ Soviet forces as necessary if
                        some Western military action on the periphery of the Bloc threatened the
                        integrity of the Bloc itself. (Para. 20)</p>
                    <p>6. We see no prospect for acceptance by the Soviets of a permanently
                        stabilized situation in Germany, which they will continue to regard as a key
                        area of struggle. While a direct challenge to the Western position in Berlin
                        proceeding from a separate “peace treaty” with East Germany cannot be
                        excluded, it seems more likely that the Soviets will continue to pursue
                        their aims by diplomatic pressure and by small unilateral steps designed to
                        whittle away the Western position and to establish the de facto sovereignty
                        of the East German regime. (Paras. 29-37)</p>
                    <p>7. It is unlikely that a change in Soviet leadership would produce any major
                        shift in the Soviet outlook or lead to policies carrying increased dangers
                        of war. However, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s present
                        role testifies to <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0444"/>the importance of
                        the individual leader in the conduct of Soviet policy, and the man or group
                        which succeeds him may introduce significant changes in style and even in
                        the weight attached to various tactics. (Para. 63)</p>
                    <p>8. Over the long run, the concept of ineradicable hostility between systems
                        may gradually come to carry less weight in determining Soviet international
                        conduct. The chances of such a long-run change depend to some extent upon
                        the strength of certain evolutionary trends within Soviet society and, to a
                        greater extent, on the impact of divisions within the Communist movement.
                        But most of all they depend on whether fundamental Communist beliefs are
                        sustained by successes in the East-West struggle or, over an extended period
                        of time, are challenged by failure to achieve substantial progress in that
                        struggle. Thus US strength, maintained at an adequate deterrent level, and
                        the effectiveness of US policy, are crucial factors bearing upon this
                        possible evolution in the Soviet outlook. (Paras. 64-69)</p>
                    <p>9. Even if such a tendency should emerge, however, strong national
                        aspirations would continue to sustain great East-West conflicts of interest.
                        The requirements of Soviet national security, prestige, and ambition, as
                        seen by the Soviet leaders and people, would still bring the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> into collision with the interests of
                        other states, even if communism lost all of its fanatical character. The
                        most that could be expected would be that some issues would become more
                        tractable and negotiable, particularly those which were not deeply rooted in
                        the national interests of the Soviet state. (Paras. 65, 69)</p>
                    <p rend="center">Discussion</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. The Soviet Outlook</p>
                    <p>10. The mood of exuberant confidence which marked the conduct of Soviet
                        foreign policy two or three years ago seems in the last year or so to have
                        sobered somewhat. In the aftermath of the Sputnik success of 1957 the
                        Soviets appeared for some time to entertain expectations of early advances
                        at the expense of the West. But the promising factors which spurred the
                        Soviet mood in that period seem to have lost some of their force and new
                        complications have arisen.</p>
                    <p>11. As the Soviets contrast 1962 to, say, 1958, they must recognize that the
                        significant advantage they then believed they would acquire in missiles and
                        therefore in strategic posture has failed to materialize. The prospects for
                        a settlement of the Berlin and German question in accord with Soviet
                        objectives, which probably seemed good through 1959 and the spring of 1960,
                        were not realized, and the attempt to resume pressure on this subject in
                        mid-1961 brought a sharp rise in the pace of the arms race. This development
                        in turn tightened the chronic squeeze on Soviet resources at a time when
                        some domestic programs, notably in agriculture, <pb n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0445"/>in housing, and in some branches of investment, were
                        falling well short of expectations. Added to these concerns, there has been
                        since at least the spring of 1960 an ever sharpening crisis in relations
                        with Communist China. This development has brought confusion and uncertainty
                        to the international Communist movement, which the Soviets see as an
                        important instrument of their challenge to the West.</p>
                    <p>12. This is not to say that the last year or two has been marked only by
                        disappointments. On the contrary, there have been significant successes
                        also. The Soviets have doubtless viewed the Cuban development as a gain.
                        Also they evidently believe that trends generally in Latin America and in
                        some other parts of the underdeveloped world show great promise in the long
                        term. They probably regard the “national liberation” struggles in Laos and
                        South Vietnam as progressing on the whole favorably. Nevertheless, the more
                        rapid general advance of Communist fortunes which the Soviets seemed to have
                        anticipated two or three years ago has failed to materialize. Their
                        confidence in the outlook at present, while still strong, seems to have
                        assumed a somewhat more dogged quality and to be keyed to an expectation of
                        slower advance. There has been no evidence, however, of any fundamental
                        reappraisal of policy in the light of a somewhat disappointing record of
                        events. Indeed the general principles and tactical methods of Soviet foreign
                        policy which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had developed
                        earlier were reaffirmed at the XXII Party Congress of late 1961.</p>
                    <p>13. The visible growth of Soviet power and of Soviet influence abroad is the
                        primary factor sustaining the Soviets' basic confidence. Thus the Soviets
                        feel that the present relation of forces enables them to challenge the
                        Western Powers at crisis points everywhere although they appreciate that the
                        risks of nuclear warfare impose caution on themselves as well as their
                        opponents. The US, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> now
                        asserts, must realize that the time has passed when it could have its own
                        way in the world, even in an area like Latin America; it must recognize the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s claim to be its great power
                        equal, and therefore entitled to be involved in the settlement of all major
                        international questions.</p>
                    <p>14. In addition to these considerations, the Soviet outlook on foreign policy
                        is also conditioned by the ideology of Marxism-Leninism. This doctrine leads
                        the Soviet leaders to see the world movement of historical forces as
                        favorable to them, to believe that they can associate all sorts of popular
                        and national aspirations with their cause, to regard the developed societies
                        of the West as transitional and destined to give way. Such an outlook
                        contains by itself few tactical prescriptions; it can be used to justify
                        periods of waiting as well as the vigorous exploitation of opportunities.
                        But it anchors Soviet policy to the premise that international politics is
                        at bottom a clash of systems which precludes any genuine, lasting
                        accommodation with the West.</p>
                    <pb n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0446"/>
                    <p>15. Soviet doctrines, however, are not unchanging. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has been resourceful in
                        introducing reformulations which reflect a growing awareness of the dangers
                        and complexities confronting the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as it
                        extends its operations in the world arena. He has placed great stress, often
                        at the cost of ideological confusion and conflict, on the preventability of
                        war, on the decisiveness of economic competition, on the legitimacy of
                        cooperation with non-Communist and even anti- Communist governments. These
                        theses are intended to permit the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                        pursue its external objectives with greater flexibility and sophistication.
                        At the same time, they are designed to justify policies which permit careful
                        control of military risks and accord high priority to the goal of domestic
                        economic growth.</p>
                    <p>16. The US occupies a special place in the Soviet outlook. The primary
                        element in the Soviet attitude is, of course, the concept of Washington as
                        the stronghold of the enemy camp. In addition, however, the Soviets have
                        great respect and even admiration for US material achievements. As rulers of
                        a nation which has newly reached the status of a superpower, they greatly
                        value any American acknowledgements of equality and, conversely, are highly
                        sensitive to any American derogation of or challenge to their prestige. This
                        factor also contributes to the recurrent Soviet impulse toward bilateralism.
                        Moscow sometimes appears to be intrigued with the notion that the two
                        greatest powers could somehow combine to contain or override the interests
                        of lesser powers. But this idea, which appears out of harmony with the
                        premise of basic conflict of systems, has not been accompanied by a
                        readiness to compromise on the major issues in dispute between the US and
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. We believe that, in the future as
                        well, this idea is more likely to affect the manner in which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> approaches these issues, and that only
                        occasionally, than to alter the substance of its positions.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Attitudes Toward War</p>
                    <p>17. Fundamental hostility toward the non-Communist world defines one limit of
                        Soviet foreign policy; so long as it persists, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will regard international issues as opportunities
                        progressively to weaken and undermine its opponents, and not as occasions
                        for conciliation which would guard the interests of all parties. The other
                        limit, which puts a check upon this aggressiveness, is the Soviet leaders'
                        awareness that their own nation and system would face destruction in a
                        general nuclear war. Both their statements and their actions in recent years
                        have demonstrated their unwillingness to run any considerable risks of this
                        eventuality. This does not mean, however, that they would always estimate
                        the risks correctly, nor does it mean that they would abandon interests they
                        considered vital in order to avoid grave risk of nuclear war.</p>
                    <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0447"/>
                    <p>18. The Soviet leaders evidently continue to base their military and foreign
                        policy planning on the assumption that the present overall military
                        relationship, in which each side can exert a strong deterrent upon the
                        other, will continue for some time to come. They are clearly determined to
                        maintain and improve their strong military posture. In addition, they are
                        vigorously pursuing programs of research and development in advanced weapons
                        to acquire whatever military advantage they can, and they would, of course,
                        make heavy political use of any successes they achieve. It is possible that
                        some future technological breakthrough would persuade them that they had
                        acquired a decisive advantage and could therefore press the West with far
                        more aggressive policies. We do not believe, however, that the Soviets base
                        their policies upon the expectation that they will be able to achieve,
                        within the foreseeable future, a military posture which would make the
                        deliberate initiation of general war a rational decision; the Soviets
                        realize that the US is determined to maintain second-strike capabilities
                        which would visit intolerable destruction upon them. In any case their
                        policies rest on the conviction that Communist victory can be won without
                        resort to nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>19. The overt Soviet position on limited wars is that these will grow,
                        rapidly and inevitably, into general nuclear war and are therefore also to
                        be avoided. In our view this formulation is primarily designed to deter the
                        West from the local use of force and does not mean that the Soviets would
                        themselves immediately expand any local conflict into general war; rather,
                        if at all possible they would employ political means to prevent such
                        escalation. In circumstances where they enjoyed a local preponderance of
                        power but important Western interests were at stake, they would probably use
                        that power with restraint in order not to confront their opponent with the
                        painful choice of enlarging the conflict or accepting a conspicuous
                        defeat.</p>
                    <p>20. We believe that the Soviets are unlikely, as a matter of general policy,
                        to assume the military and political risks involved in using their own
                        forces to achieve local gains. Nevertheless, they might do so in some area
                        adjacent to Bloc territory if they judged that the West, either because it
                        was deterred by Soviet nuclear power or for some other reason, would not
                        make an effective military response. They would probably employ Soviet
                        forces as necessary if some Western military action on the periphery of the
                        Bloc threatened the integrity of the Bloc itself. Even in the latter case,
                        however, they would attempt to use their forces in a way calculated to bring
                        hostilities to a conclusion short of general war. At a much lower level,
                        they will almost certainly encourage and support the use of force by
                        pro-Communist forces when they believe that a local situation is ripe for
                        forceful exploitation and that the challenge to Western interests is not <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0448"/>great enough, and their own
                        involvement not direct enough, to involve risks of a direct encounter
                        between US and Soviet forces.</p>
                    <p>21. This estimate of Soviet views on general and local war is generally
                        consistent with the positions laid out by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> on 6 January 1961, when he defined various types
                        of wars and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s attitude toward
                        them. On that occasion, in addition to stating Soviet opposition to both
                        world wars and local wars between states, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> distinguished a category of “wars of national
                        liberation, or popular uprisings.” Such internal wars, ranging pro-Soviet or
                        anti-Western forces against colonial or pro-Western regimes, he declared to
                        be “just” and deserving of Communist support. He was carefully vague,
                        however, in discussing the forms which this support would take, and in
                        particular he neither promised nor hinted that Soviet forces would join in
                        the fighting. It has become clear in the past year that this was not a
                        statement of intent to usher in a new phase of vigorous Soviet incitement of
                        such conflicts everywhere, or of maximum military assistance to “national
                        liberation” forces.</p>
                    <p>22. Instead, it seems likely that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s emphasis on “national liberation” warfare, not
                        a new idea at all, was intended in part to meet Chinese criticisms then
                        being made that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, by its
                        undifferentiated stress upon the need to avoid war, was in fact ruling out
                        altogether the use of force in advancing the Communist cause. This charge is
                        a major component in the Chinese attack upon the correctness of Soviet
                        policies and, therefore, upon the legitimacy of the USSR's traditional
                        leadership of the Communist movement. It is also designed to win for China
                        the allegiance of Communists and radicals in the less developed countries,
                        who are less firmly tied to Soviet leadership than their European
                        counterparts. Despite these Chinese pressures, the USSR has not given full
                        political and material support or committed its prestige to all armed
                        anti-Western movements in the underdeveloped areas. We believe that the
                        Soviets will continue to follow an opportunistic policy in this regard.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Strategy of “Peaceful Coexistence”</p>
                    <p>23. In the Soviet leaders' assessment of the forces at work in the modern
                        world, there are a host of issues, trends, and sentiments which can be
                        turned to their account. The strategy of “peaceful coexistence,” which is
                        the fruit of this assessment, is intended to focus the attention and
                        energies of Communists everywhere upon the incessant exploitation of these
                        forces. This strategy puts great stress on the virtues of flexibility and
                        expediency, and allows for a wide variety of contradictory tactics,
                        frequently pursued simultaneously. Thus military intimidation goes hand in
                        hand with championing of the peace theme, bourgeois governments are courted
                        while their local Communist opponents receive Soviet support, and the
                        Western Powers are treated to promises of détente <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0449"/>while their colonies and ex-colonies are
                        urged to turn against the “imperialists” and while Moscow maintains its
                        demands for concessions on Berlin.</p>
                    <p>24. One noteworthy tactic of this strategy is the raising periodically of
                        demands for Summit meetings. Because his success in Soviet politics has
                        depended partly on his personal qualities, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is probably prone to overestimate the effect on
                        foreign statesmen of the pressure he brings to bear in personal encounter.
                        He also believes that, at such a meeting, his Western counterparts will be
                        under greater pressure than he to avoid a “failure” and will therefore be
                        obliged to make concessions to Soviet positions. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> clearly has a personal penchant for meetings with
                        the President, which we believe reflects his desire that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> shall be acknowledged as America's great
                        power equal and that he himself shall personify this equality. Finally, he
                        probably also conceives of Summit meetings as a way of further entrenching
                        his own leadership in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the
                        validity of his own prescriptions for dealing with the West.</p>
                    <p>25. Central to the “peaceful coexistence” strategy is the belief that time is
                        on the side of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and that, without
                        general war, the Western position can be gradually but steadily eroded. This
                        belief in turn rests in great part upon the Soviet conviction that economic
                        competition is the decisive factor in the struggle of the two systems. This
                        is the meaning of the slogan emphasized so prominently at the XXII Congress,
                        that the Soviet Party “considers Communist construction in the Soviet Union
                        as the fulfillment of its international duty to the working people of all
                        countries.” The Soviet leaders expect that tangible economic successes in
                        physical power and popular well-being will prove so impressive and
                        attractive, and so disheartening to their opponents, that their own position
                        and prospects in the international arena will be steadily enhanced.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Chinese Critique of Soviet Policy</p>
                    <p>26. But this slogan, however closely it is linked in the Soviet outlook with
                        the prospects of the Communist movement, clearly implies that the claims of
                        that movement will be subordinated to the security concerns and national
                        interests of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. And so it is
                        precisely at this point, where the theses on war and economic competition
                        combine to produce the strategy of “peaceful coexistence,” that the Chinese
                        Communists have raised a fundamental dissent. They perceive in this Soviet
                        analysis a justification for denying priority to courses of action which
                        meet Chinese interests but fail to serve directly the objectives of the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Chinese leaders see
                        confirmation of their suspicions in a host of indicators: Soviet reluctance
                        to provide them with advanced weapon capabilities, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s recurrent moves toward détente
                        and direct dealings with the Western leaders, Moscow's stress on the
                        disarmament issue, and its unwillingness to give support to all-out tactics
                        of militancy in all areas of <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0450"/>contention with the West. Perhaps most important, the Chinese object to
                        the Soviet leaders' insistence upon building communism in the USSR first and
                        their concomitant refusal to delay domestic progress in order to bring all
                        members of the Bloc up to the level of their own country.</p>
                    <p>27. There is some truth, we believe, in Chinese contentions, but it is an old
                        truth. Ever since its founding the USSR has regularly subordinated the
                        claims of foreign Communist parties to national objectives whenever a
                        conflict arose between them. The essential difference now is that, with the
                        growth of the international movement and especially with the accession of
                        some parties to state power, these claims have become more diverse and
                        urgent. In particular, China has sufficient power and independence to defy
                        Soviet discipline and to argue its case with great force.</p>
                    <p>28. We have analyzed in a recent estimate the way in which the Soviets sought
                        at the XXII Congress, by the attacks on Stalin, Albania, and the “antiparty
                        group,” to discredit Peiping's policy views.<note n="2" xml:id="d187fn2">11-5-62, “Political Developments in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the Communist World,” dated 21 February 1962.
                            [Footnote in the source text. <ref target="#d160">Document
                            160</ref>.]</note> Then and subsequently, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has reasserted its foreign policies in the face of
                        opposition within the movement and has served notice that adherence to
                        “peaceful coexistence” is a matter of Communist discipline. The Chinese have
                        nevertheless continued publicly to oppose and criticize Soviet policies,
                        making use of doctrinal arguments which find considerable response among
                        Communists who cling to the orthodoxy of an earlier day. We believe that
                        there is no longer much chance of a fundamental resolution of Sino-Soviet
                        differences, and that in the continuing competition between the two the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, despite its vigorous rebuttal of
                        Chinese criticisms, will find itself unable to ignore them entirely in
                        framing its tactics. This factor will not, in our view, cause the Soviets to
                        run significantly greater risks in East-West confrontations than they are
                        now willing to contemplate. But, depending upon the course of this
                        competition, it will exert greater or lesser pressures on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to display militancy against the West and
                        to achieve tangible successes which demonstrate the correctness of Moscow's
                        policies.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Soviet Policies in the Near Future</p>
                    <p>Berlin and Germany</p>
                    <p>29. The issues arising from the division of Germany remain, as they have for
                        the entire postwar period, the most critical in the whole confrontation
                        between East and West. The Soviets wish to bolster beyond challenge the
                        internal stability of the East German Satellite regime, always the potential
                        weak link in the East European system, where a breakdown of Communist power
                        could place in hazard all the regimes under Soviet hegemony in that area.
                        The concurrent Soviet offensive aim <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0451"/>is to limit the West German contribution to the strength of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and ultimately to separate the Federal
                        Republic from its Western partners. Both of these objectives have inspired
                        the three year old Soviet effort to erode the Western position in Berlin and
                        ultimately to effect a withdrawal of the allies from the city. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> believes that, if he is
                        successful, this would be a long step toward establishing the permanence and
                        stability of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and would at the same
                        time deliver a body blow to West Germany's confidence in its allies and,
                        indeed, to the confidence and cohesion of the entire <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Alliance.</p>
                    <p>30. More than three years of postponement, however, clearly signifies the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s awareness of the dangers
                        inherent in unilateral actions encroaching upon Western rights in Berlin.
                        The chief result of the stiff Soviet demands put forth again in June 1961
                        was to provoke from the US a display of firmness and a military buildup; as
                        a consequence, the USSR felt obliged to undertake increased military
                        expenditures and demonstrations which in turn curbed <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s efforts to readjust economic
                        priorities in favor of the consumer. In this situation, he was quick to use
                        the subsequent US initiative for bilateral talks as a pretext for
                        withdrawing his 31 December deadline for a separate treaty.</p>
                    <p>31. In the light of this record, we think it unlikely that the Soviets are
                        resolved to bring the Berlin issue to a head in some fixed period of time.
                        The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, by closing the sector border, has
                        overcome the refugee problem in a way which avoided a direct infringement on
                        essential Allied rights. Nevertheless, the building of the wall has reduced
                        only one of the urgencies in their Berlin problem, and their basic
                        objectives remain unsecured. In addition, Soviet prestige, and that of
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> personally has been
                        deeply committed to demonstrable progress in this question. The Soviets must
                        fear that continued failure to advance will not only hearten their Western
                        opponents, but will also lend greater weight among Communists to Chinese
                        criticisms that the “peaceful coexist-ence” strategy is a failure and in
                        reality disguises the USSR's abandonment of militant struggle against the
                        West.</p>
                    <p>32. Thus we believe that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will
                        continue its efforts to obtain at least minimal concessions through
                        negotiation. Its tactics in current diplomatic conversations and periodic
                        harassment on the access routes to West Berlin are intended to serve this
                        end. At the same time, however, other Soviet maneuvers suggest an effort to
                        broaden the scope of East-West discussions in a fashion which would obscure
                        a fundamental stalemate over the Berlin question. These maneuvers are
                        probably intended to preserve Soviet flexibility while diplomatic probing of
                        the Allied position on Berlin continues. In addition, they permit the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to explore the possibilities of making
                        gains in related political areas, such as European security arrangements or
                        greater recognition for East Germany, which could for a time compensate for
                        the lack of progress toward their objectives in Berlin.</p>
                    <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0452"/>
                    <p>33. We believe that, despite their hitherto essentially unyielding stand on
                        the terms of a Berlin solution, there will be some flexibility in actual
                        Soviet negotiating tactics. Among the various provisions associated with the
                        “free city” proposal, probably the demand for a change in the status of West
                        Berlin has the greatest immediate importance to the USSR. The Soviets
                        probably do not expect to obtain Western agreement to this demand, however,
                        and they are likely at some point to accept some “compromise” formula. It
                        might provide for the allies to remain in West Berlin and to enjoy access to
                        the city in exchange for undertakings which the Soviets could represent as a
                        change in the city's status and some de facto recognition of the GDR. This
                        would have the additional advantage of allowing them subsequently, with
                        minimum risk, to fulfill their commitment to sign a separate peace treaty,
                        particularly if the new arrangements left open to the allies the face-saving
                        device of treating East German controllers as Soviet agents. The Soviets
                        might even accept, as part of a Berlin arrangement, some form of
                        international supervision over access, but they would seek to inject the GDR
                        as fully as possible into these procedures.</p>
                    <p>34. We have regularly estimated that, if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> reached the conclusion that the allies were unwilling to
                        grant any significant concessions in negotiations, it would proceed along
                        the road of a separate peace treaty. Repeated Soviet procrastination on
                        various pretexts, however, has demonstrated the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s extreme reluctance to take this step. While we believe
                        that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would not accompany the
                        signing of a treaty with an immediate and absolute challenge to Allied
                        access, the Soviets would not wish such a treaty to be entirely meaningless,
                        yet its risks would increase in proportion to the meaningfulness of its
                        implementation. Accordingly, there is a good chance that they will continue
                        for some months to exercise their pressures through a variety of local
                        harassments, hoping in this way to demoralize both the allies and the West
                        Berliners and thus to create more favorable conditions for later
                        negotiations. But we cannot exclude the possibility that a combination of
                        circumstances might lead the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, sometime
                        during the next year or so, to embark on a course of major unilateral steps
                        of the kind threatened under a separate peace treaty.</p>
                    <p>35. Whatever their tactics in the period immediately ahead, we think it
                        highly unlikely that during the next few years the Soviets will come to
                        regard Berlin as an issue to be settled by a genuine and lasting compromise
                        which stops short of incorporating the western half of the city into East
                        Germany. Their objectives in this area are deeply rooted in their view of
                        Soviet security requirements: nor will they soon abandon the idea that the
                        changed relation of forces between East and West has rendered West Berlin an
                        anachronism which they need not tolerate forever.</p>
                    <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0453"/>
                    <p>36. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> intends, by demonstrating the
                        firmness of its hold upon East Germany and its ability to threaten West
                        Berlin, to stimulate doubts in the Federal Republic about the validity of
                        Bonn's whole foreign policy orientation. As a supplement to this approach,
                        the Soviet Government has recently stepped up its efforts to urge upon
                        German opinion the advantages of a more neutral posture. The Soviets are
                        encouraged in this effort by the recent political gains of the Free
                        Democrats and the prospects of <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>'s departure. They are likely to develop this tactic
                        further in the coming year.</p>
                    <p>37. The more active policy the Soviets have lately pursued toward West
                        Germany probably reflects also their concern about the advance of the Common
                        Market and the European unity movement. They have already made it clear that
                        they regard affiliation of the European neutrals with the Common Market as a
                        threat to their interests. Their understanding of the European unity
                        movement has probably never been very clear, perhaps because the phenomenon
                        of “capitalist” states submerging national interests in supranational
                        institutions is in flat contradiction to Marxist-Leninist teachings. But
                        their misgivings about this development, which they have few means to
                        combat, are evidently real. Most of all they would be prone to suspect that
                        the Germans will come to dominate “Europe” and find in it the means of power
                        to pursue “revanchist” aims. In addition, they are bound to fear the
                        disruptive effects on their inherently unstable and relatively impoverished
                        Satellite empire of a Europe growing in unity, strength, and prosperity.</p>
                    <p>Disarmament</p>
                    <p>38. Soviet behavior in the disarmament field in the last year or so has
                        reinforced our earlier judgments that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s primary objectives in this area are to identify itself
                        with universal desires for peace and an end to the arms race and to inhibit
                        and discredit Western policy. Thus agitation for disarmament is conceived by
                        the Soviets as political action intended to bring about alignments favorable
                        to their interests, and also to make it difficult for their opponents to
                        employ force against Communist advances. We believe that the Soviets do have
                        an interest in reducing their present and particularly their prospective
                        military burden. The economic argument for disarmament, which in the past
                        clearly has not been compelling, may acquire increasing weight if the
                        armaments race is not contained. As for the dangers of war, the Soviets
                        still prefer to rely on their own armed strength, and on the control which
                        they intend to retain over the development of crisis situations, rather than
                        to meet Western requirements for inspection and to forfeit the political
                        advantages of their great military power.</p>
                    <p>39. We believe that, at least during the near future, Soviet activity in this
                        field will continue to aim at political exploitation and the imposition of
                        restraints upon their opponents rather than at agreements on terms <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0454"/>which the West would find
                        acceptable. Along with their advocacy of general and complete disarmament,
                        they will maintain an interest in some partial measures, especially those
                        which have a specific political import. A nuclear free zone, for example,
                        tends not only to impede Western nuclear deployment and sharing, but applied
                        to Germany has the effect of imposing a special denial on the Federal
                        Republic and weakening its military and political ties with its Western
                        partners. The Soviets will also advocate schemes in the European security
                        field which would promote the de facto recognition of the GDR and require a
                        reduction in the American military presence in Europe. They will also try to
                        make use of the disarmament negotiating process for other ends: cultivating
                        support among participating nonaligned states, establishing the principle of
                        tripartitism, and achieving direct contact with Western leaders.</p>
                    <p>40. Having completed an extensive nuclear test series last fall, the Soviets
                        are now seeking to maximize the political costs of further Western testing,
                        coupling propaganda with repeated offers to sign a test ban treaty based on
                        national detection systems. Now that the US has resumed atmospheric testing,
                        we think it certain that Soviet tests will follow. At the same time,
                        however, the USSR will continue to agitate the test ban issue if only
                        because of the general political appeal of this question. But we do not
                        foresee any considerable movement toward Western terms in the Soviets'
                        position over the next year or so. They probably consider that they have a
                        high priority requirement for further testing and in any case they will
                        almost certainly continue to resist the inspection features of Western test
                        ban proposals.</p>

                        Soviet Outlook</p>
                    <p>62. In the opening section of this estimate, we have set forth certain broad
                        considerations underlying Soviet foreign policy which are likely to remain
                        generally valid for some time to come. We recognize, however, that the
                        environment in which Soviet policy is made is changing. It may therefore be
                        useful to examine three major factors—the course of developments within the
                        USSR, changing relations inside the Bloc and the Communist movement, and the
                        movement of events in the East-West competition—and to consider how they
                        might in the long run affect the Soviet outlook on international
                        politics.</p>
                    <p>Internal Developments</p>
                    <p>63. Within the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s removal from the scene might
                        be followed by a prolonged power struggle which could produce confusion and
                        uncertainty in foreign policy or considerable fluctuations in tactics. Apart
                        from this possibility, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        present role testifies to the importance <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0455"/>of the individual leader in the conduct of Soviet policy,
                        and the man or group which succeeds him may introduce significant changes in
                        style and even in the weight attached to various tactics. We think it
                        certain, however, that such a leadership would appreciate, as fully as does
                        the present one, the consequences of nuclear war. Further, this leadership
                        would be unlikely to take a substantially different view either of the
                        interests of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or of the risks
                        justified by these interests. We do not believe, therefore, that a change of
                        Soviet leadership would in itself produce any major shift in the Soviet
                        outlook or lead to policies carrying increased dangers of war.</p>
                    <p>64. Present trends suggest that, over the long run, popular aspirations are
                        likely to acquire a larger influence in Soviet domestic politics.<note n="3" xml:id="d187fn3">
                            <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-5-62, “Political Developments in
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the Communist World,”
                            (paragraphs 33-37), dated 21 February 1962 for a more complete
                            discussion of this matter. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> We
                        believe that such a development would have some effect on the conduct of
                        foreign policy, but this process would almost certainly be gradual and
                        subject to setbacks. Even now the Soviet people are not enthusiastically
                        committed to all aspects of Communist ideology. In particular, they are not
                        obsessed with the idea of ineradicable and total conflict, on ideological
                        grounds, between themselves and the non-Communist world. Their desire for
                        peace and for more rapid gains in material welfare is pronounced. To the
                        extent that these attitudes become more important in formulating Soviet
                        foreign policy, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s reluctance to
                        enter upon risky confrontations with the West—especially for the sake of
                        advancing the Communist cause in remote areas—would be reinforced.</p>
                    <p>65. At the same time, the Russian people possess strong nationalist feeling.
                        They welcome and support a vigorous assertion of Soviet power on the world
                        scene in furtherance of Soviet national interest. Accordingly, we believe
                        that, even if Soviet politics come to represent popular opinion to a greater
                        degree than at present there would not necessarily be any substantial
                        lessening of international conflict. But the nature of such conflict, and
                        the atmosphere in which it took place, would change, becoming less
                        ideological and more traditional. While East-West disputes would persist,
                        there would be a better chance of the occasional recognition of areas of
                        common interest between the contending powers.</p>
                    <p>Relations in the Communist World</p>
                    <p>66. Soviet control over the international Communist movement is likely to be
                        further diminished in the face of pressures for national autonomy. This
                        process, insofar as it enables individual parties to give a more national
                        cast to their policies, may increase the effectiveness of Communist
                        political appeals in some areas. This result, however, is likely to be more
                        than offset by the spectacle of policy conflicts and doctrinal argument <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0456"/>within the movement. These
                        consequences will tend to rob Soviet policy of the special authority which
                        it has derived from the concept of a wholly united movement based on a
                        single agreed interpretation of human society. In addition, some of the
                        Soviet energies now directed against the West may be diverted to combating
                        Chinese policies in various areas.</p>
                    <p>67. Behind these difficulties for the execution of Soviet policy, however,
                        lies the possibility of an important change in the Soviet outlook itself. If
                        the Chinese challenge produces a definitive and open Sino-Soviet break, and
                        if China subsequently progresses toward great power status and develops an
                        effective rivalry to the USSR as a claimant to leadership of the Communist
                        movement, the Soviet view of world politics as essentially a bipolar
                        struggle would be increasingly difficult to sustain. In these circumstances,
                        the Soviet leaders might come to feel that in some matters their interests
                        paralleled those of the West rather than those of their enormous and
                        uncontrollable neighbor.</p>
                    <p>The Course of East-West Competition</p>
                    <p>68. Perhaps the most significant factor which will affect the Soviet outlook,
                        however, is the success or failure which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s foreign policy encounters in the years to come.
                        Successes in expanding Soviet influence, major weakenings in Western
                        positions, and in particular any further advances of direct Communist rule
                        will act to confirm the Soviet leaders in their analysis of a fundamental
                        conflict of systems destined to end in their triumph. However, they have
                        already experienced difficulty in translating real gains in military power
                        into concrete political successes under conditions of nuclear stalemate. And
                        in the underdeveloped areas, it has proven far more difficult to move the
                        newer nations into a full association with Soviet policies and thence along
                        the path toward Communist control than the Soviets thought it would be when,
                        in an earlier phase, these countries were emerging from Western rule. If
                        Soviet objectives should be continually frustrated, the Soviet leaders would
                        have to reappraise the validity of some of their key doctrines. They might
                        in this case gradually relax their effort to extend communism
                            everywhere.<note n="4" xml:id="d187fn4">The <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> representative to the <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss> does not concur with paragraph 68, feeling that: if
                            Soviet objectives should be continually frustrated, the Soviet leaders
                            would have to reappraise their tactics in applying some of their key
                            doctrines. They might, in this case, find it necessary to delay their
                            efforts to extend communism everywhere. [Footnote in the source
                            text.]</note> Alternatively, they might become far more aggressive in
                        order to make good on the traditional commitment to make communism a world
                        system; but, assuming that the West retained its deterrent power, this seems
                        less likely because of the greater risks such a course would involve. Thus
                        US strength, maintained at an adequate deterrent level, and <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0457"/>the effectiveness of US policy are crucial
                        factors bearing upon this possible evolution in the Soviet outlook.</p>
                    <p>69. In sum, none of the factors discussed above portends any early or sharp
                        change in the basic Soviet outlook upon the external world. Still less do
                        they suggest that any deliberate renunciation of Marxism-Leninism, or of the
                        international movement built upon it, is likely. They do point, however, to
                        the possibility that in time—almost certainly a long time—the special
                        intensity which ideological hostility imparts to world politics may
                        diminish. Such a development would not mean that international conflicts of
                        interest ceased to exist, or even that the danger of general war was
                        appreciably reduced. On the contrary, the requirements of Soviet national
                        security, prestige, and ambition, as seen by the Soviet leaders and people,
                        would still bring the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> into collision
                        with the interests of other states, even if communism lost all of its
                        fanatical character. The most that could be expected would be that some
                        issues would become more tractable and negotiable, particularly those which
                        were not deeply rooted in the national interests of the Soviet state, and
                        that the occasional recognition of a measure of common interest between the
                        USSR and its adversaries would not be invariably stifled by ideological
                        hostility.</p>

                    <p>Difficult assess significance this policy of drift. So far as Berlin
                        concerned I believe K has been influenced by our military preparations, by
                        fact he must know that so far as U.S. concerned we consider missile gap in
                        our favor, and by situation in East Germany. In view Soviet internal demands
                        it cannot have been easy for Soviets to provide credit of over 300 million
                        dollars to East Germans and I should think Soviets would be at pains avoid
                        allowing Berlin situation develop in such manner as to bring end to
                        interzonal trade which would enormously increase economic burden on them
                        quite apart from danger of uprising in East Germany as well as risk of war.
                        (On other hand K so deeply committed to solution Berlin problem, difficult
                        see how he can allow it to drag on until factors mentioned above have
                        changed.) While I believe K remains firmly in control there is little doubt
                        that there is disagreement in leadership <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0459"/>on major policies. Among others may be mentioned following
                        on which both logic and some evidence point to differences of opinion:</p>
                    <p>1. Extent of de-Stalinization;</p>
                    <p>2. Agricultural policy; heavy vs light industry and general problem
                        allocation resources;</p>
                    <p>3. Basic military policy and disarmament;</p>
                    <p>4. Bloc relations;</p>
                    <p>5. Foreign policy both as to content and conduct including attitude toward
                        relations with us and personal diplomacy;</p>
                    <p>6. Policy toward under-developed countries including role Communist parties
                        and amount and direction Soviet aid;</p>
                    <p>7. Internal party matters such as personnel, role of party, aims, extent of
                        democratization, control of population, handling of youth.</p>
                    <p>Given setbacks of past 6 months or so and opposition to various of his
                        policies on foregoing problems, natural K would wish avoid initiatives at
                        this time which might add to those who for one reason or another may be
                        inclined question his leadership. Will be noted that many of his most
                        serious problems such as agriculture, missile gap, and situation East
                        Germany, not capable of quick solution and would be rational expect K to
                        seek détente with West for period of at least couple years. This would also
                        be consistent with his basic policy of co-existence. Key to such détente, as
                        K himself has pointed out, is Berlin problem. Difficulty with this analysis
                        is that Soviets not always rational by our standards and always possible K
                        will conclude that to maintain his position at home and deal with Chinese
                        problem abroad he should make radical change in policy. On balance however I
                        consider this unlikely. I also think it unlikely that he will pay our price
                        for real Berlin solution and that present “neither peace nor war” situation
                        will continue. Likely Soviet move on Berlin is another approach to West
                        Germans. While this would probably not succeed, would appear be some
                        possibility of deal in which in return for West German concessions Soviets
                        would get rid of Ulbricht and allow regime develop in East Germany along
                        Polish lines. If some such move not tried or is unsuccessful, I continue
                        believe K will sign his separate treaty but take steps prevent it from
                        bringing on serious conflict with West.</p>

                        Friday afternoon at the Soviet reception to have a few private words with
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>.</p>
                    <p>I told him that Marshal Malinovsky's statement on the subject of surprise
                        attack, naming the President of the United States, had been noted here, and
                        seemed to me to be a revision to Stalin-type diplomacy and not in any way
                        conducive to the development of the type of relationships that we were
                        seeking with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>I reviewed with him the history of the <hi rend="italic">Saturday Evening
                            Post</hi> article,<note n="4" xml:id="d189fn4">See <ref target="#d179fn1">footnote 1, Document 179</ref>.</note> pointing
                        out that, in effect, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had merely restated the policy in this regard which
                        had been that of the previous Administration, but that due to an imprecisely
                        written account in the article, was susceptible of misunderstanding. I
                        emphasized that the White House had immediately issued a clarification<note n="5" xml:id="d189fn5">Parts of this clarification, issued by <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName> on March 27, are quoted in <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>, March 28, 1962.</note> to set
                        any misinterpretation straight, but that apparently the Soviet Government
                        preferred to pick up the wrong interpretation and give it widest publicity
                        through an important speech by their Minister of Defense, on May Day. I
                        added that there were enough problems confronting our two countries without
                        deliberately trying to increase misunderstanding by a false interpretation,
                        which I felt was the case in regard to <persName corresp="#p_MRY1">Malinovsky</persName>'s speech.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> did not attempt to defend
                        the <persName corresp="#p_MRY1">Malinovsky</persName> speech beyond saying
                        that he did not know its origin, and appeared to feel that it was perhaps a
                        mistake. He, however, did state that “they” had been very much surprised at
                        the attribution to the President in the Saturday Evening Post article and
                        had wondered whether the President was trying to strike <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0461"/>out on a new nuclear policy for the United
                        States. He admitted that they perhaps should have paid more attention to the
                        White House clarification, but did not dwell on it. I told him that if there
                        were any points of this nature which were unclear, he had access to various
                        people in the Department of State or elsewhere from which he would be able
                        to receive a true account, with which he agreed.</p>
                    <p>The conversation was completely calm and friendly, and I gathered that
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was somewhat embarrassed
                        by <persName corresp="#p_MRY1">Malinovsky</persName>'s reference to the
                        President, but he also retained enough of typical Soviet suspicion to have
                        believed in the possibility of a highly contrived method of presenting a
                        policy departure with the White House clarification part of this subtle
                        performance. Operating as they do under a highly disciplined centralized
                        authority, they find it very difficult to believe in the quality of accident
                        in any public statement on policy.</p>

                            briefing in a memorandum of discussion, April 30. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> noted that, following the
                            briefing, “the President asked whether our recent photography caused a
                            change in our estimates. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> answered no, that our '62 and '63 estimates
                            remain. I however took a different position. I stated there were now 76
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launching pads located and
                            there were probably some which we had not located. Some were completed,
                            the majority apparently under construction. I pointed out our mid-62
                            estimate was 35 to 50 ICBMs on pads and ready to go. I now felt we have
                            to accept the higher figure as the minimum.” (Ibid.)</note> had
                        disclosed that additional Soviet <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0462"/>ICBMs which now total 81 in being or under construction and MRBMs which
                        now total 440 located sites in being or under construction. We are not
                        raising our mid-62 estimate but the President was told that the matter was
                        under review and that we will probably raise our mid-63 estimate of Soviet

                        parachute did not open and the most recent Samos was lost. The President was
                        further advised that Discoverer units were being purchased in sufficient
                        number to carry on the program through '62 and into '63, if trouble
                        developed with Samos.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> reviewed the attached
                            memorandum<note n="4" xml:id="d190fn4">Not printed.</note> on the number
                        of operational U.S. <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s and Polaris
                        missiles, stating that the figures were approximate but representative of
                        the order of magnitude of our own situation. He advised the President that
                        on the basis of these figures and known Soviet effort, there would not be a
                        “missile gap” in the future. However, there is a wide disparity between the
                        Soviet <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> capability and that of the
                        West. The question of the '58, '59, '60 estimates which created the illusion
                        of the missile gap was raised with the President. General Taylor defended
                        the estimates for those years on the basis of conclusions drawn from all
                        intelligence which was then available to the Intelligence Community and to
                        the military.</p>

                    <p>On May 10, 1962, Ambassador to Laos Winthrop Brown informed the Department of
                        State in telegram 1534 from Vientiane that the military situation in Laos
                        continued to deteriorate. The seizure of the provincial <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0463"/>capital city of Nam Tha and its subsequent
                        rapid exploitation by Pathet Lao/Viet Minh forces “has transformed what just
                        prior to May 5 had begun to be a somewhat encouraging situation, into a
                        dangerous and ugly one. The collapse of the FAR [Royal Armed Forces] on
                        their retreat from Nam Tha has left the whole of northwest Laos open to
                            <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/Vietminh seizure at their option.”
                        Brown added that the refusal by the Soviets thus far to help rectify the
                        situation was entirely consistent with the theory “that the Soviet desire
                        for a peaceful settlement here has, to say the least, substantially
                        diminished.” Brown argued that he did not see “how we can let this breach of
                        cease-fire agreement and personal undertakings go without some form of
                        positive reaction if the Russians remain indifferent to our protests.” For

                    <p>An internal Department of State memorandum on Communist aims in Southeast
                        Asia, May 11, 1962, prepared by the Deputy Director of the Vietnam Task
                        Force, Chalmers Wood, expressed the opinion that “the Russians think
                        Communism can make gains without local wars. They will back wars of
                        ‘National Liberation’ provided the risks are controllable.” The Chinese
                        Communists, on the other hand, “think local wars are the best way to spread
                        Communism and will accept higher risks.” The memorandum argued against
                        holding an international conference with the Soviets and Chinese on Vietnam,
                        asserting that U.S. participation in such a conference would be seen as an
                        “act of weakness.” For text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v02">

                    <p>Another internal Department of State memorandum, prepared about the same time
                        by the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, discussed the international
                        implications of the Joint Chiefs of Staff proposal to establish a military
                        “command structure for US forces being moved to Thailand and the Southeast
                        Asian area in connection with the situation in Laos.” The memorandum
                        contended that Moscow understood and gave credence to U.S. claims that its
                        military buildup in Southeast Asia was for a limited purpose only, but that
                        Peiping and Hanoi were “more directly concerned than Moscow, and we think
                        they are more apt to view our assertions with a jaundiced eye.” For text,

                    <p>2571. To Ambassador for <hi rend="italic">Salinger</hi> from <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName>. The President wants to be sure that
                        no impression is given that you have come to Moscow to talk substantive
                        matters with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Therefore,
                        in any public discussion of your meetings with him you should take the
                        following line: first, the meetings were informal and took place entirely at
                        the Chairman's initiative; second, your own discussion of substantive
                        matters was confined entirely to the field of wider exchanges of
                        information, such as the proposed TV exchange; and third, the rest of the
                        conversation on your side was entirely informal and personal.</p>
                    <p>If the conversation was limited in the same way on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s side, you should emphasize
                        that fact. But if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has used
                        the occasion for a serious presentation of his substantive views, and if you
                        believe that this fact will become known in Moscow, you should make it plain
                        that while the Chairman expressed certain substantive views to you, you
                        confined yourself to listening, because you had no authority from the
                        President to engage in any policy discussions.<note n="2" xml:id="d193fn2">Source text not signed.</note>

                    <p>On May 12, 1962, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>, Chairman
                        of the Department of State's Policy Planning Council, recommended in a
                        memorandum to Secretary of State Rusk that the United States “inform Moscow
                        that we are counting on continued Soviet support for the Laos solution
                        agreed between us at the highest level; i.e., a neutral, independent Laos.
                        We have moved the politics of the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> in
                        this direction and are prepared to move <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0465"/>them further. But the role of North Vietnam in Laos, in the
                        context of the Nam Tha engagement, is unacceptable to us, as is the North
                        Vietnam role in South Vietnam.” <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> wrote further that “Soviet behavior suggests that
                        they have agreed to let Hanoi and Peiping experiment with extended
                        aggression in Laos; but there is no indication that they [the Soviets] are
                        prepared to let their prestige become involved or their freedom of action be
                        determined by others in a U.S.-Hanoi or U.S.-Peiping military engagement.”

                    <p>In a second memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, May 31,
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> urged that, in addition to
                        issuing firm statements of policy and making public the “crucial role of
                        North Vietnamese forces in Laos, as well as in South Viet-Nam,” the United
                        States “propose to inflict selective damage on North Viet-Nam for its
                        aggression beyond its borders until that aggression ceases. I do not have in
                        mind here massive bombing of Hanoi. I do have in mind highly selective
                        attack on transport and power facilities, by precision methods, which are
                        now within our capability, plus some mining of Haiphong harbor.” <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> acknowledged that there were risks
                        involved but contended that “the internal situation in both North Viet-Nam
                        and Communist China, plus the relatively favorable balance of nuclear
                        strength between the US and the Soviet Union, and the Sino-Soviet split,
                        make this as good a time to face this risk as any we are likely to confront
                        in this decade.” For text, see ibid., pages 432-433.</p>

                        private conversation with me and he brought in <persName corresp="#p_SVM1">Sukhodrev</persName>. He said he wanted take opportunity my presence to
                        make historical review of relations Soviet Govt with this administration.
                        First he wanted tell me he had never been impressed by <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> whom he considered intellectually
                        shallow. He said prior to election Lodge, with whom he had had very friendly
                        relations and with whom he had enjoyed traveling around US, had made
                        overtures through certain Soviet contacts of his to have <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> release RB-47 pilots. He said he was cognizant
                        that to have done that would have won election for <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. He had determined in his mind that
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> would make better President and he said
                        also determined that if <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> was elected he would
                        immediately release RB-47 pilots in order improve relations with new
                        administration. He went on to say he had enjoyed meeting President at Vienna
                        whom he had found most vigorous and forceful advocate of his country, very
                        able man who was trying to see new ways through old problems. He said in
                        year since Vienna there had been great improvement in American public
                        opinion and he had also noticed improvement West German public opinion. He
                        was particularly grateful President had received his daughter Rada and his
                        son-in-law <persName corresp="#p_AAI1">Adzhubei</persName>. He said no other
                        recent President would have made such generous gesture toward Soviet Union.
                        He then went on to say Berlin problem was central issue that divided US and
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and solution this problem would
                        bring about solution all other problems that involved two countries. He said
                        he was not sure US was sincere on subject of disarmament and nuclear test
                        ban. Soviet Union really wanted achieve disarmament. I interrupted him to
                        say I knew US would not have gone forward and tested had it been able
                        arrange agreement on test ban with Soviet Union and further that President
                        had stated only several months ago at press conference that he considered
                        failure achieve test ban agreement as greatest failure his first year in

                    <p>On May 19, 1962, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a memorandum to Secretary of
                        Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, expressed their
                        views on seven issues relating to the draft treaty outline on disarmament.
                        The Joint Chiefs were “convinced that disarmament without full verification
                        of retained armament would jeopardize our national security.” They pointed
                        out that “since late 1961 there has been continuing pressure to negotiate
                        the reduction of US nuclear capabilities in isolation of other proposed
                        disarmament measures. Success in this effort would seriously reduce the
                        major military advantage we now enjoy and drastically alter our military
                        posture. Further there is a danger of US positions being weakened by
                        proposals which have been submitted in attempts to make them more
                        ‘negotiable’ by approaching the Soviet positions.” For text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v07">

                    <p>In a meeting with Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> in Washington on May 30, 1962, Secretary of State
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> argued that the two sides
                        were unlikely to agree soon on the principles of a lasting agreement on
                        Berlin. To avoid confrontation, they should agree to disagree and focus on
                        learning to live with that fact as they continued to work for a permanent
                        settlement. For text of the portion of the memorandum of conversation
                        dealing with Germany and Berlin, see <ref target="frus1961-63v15">

                        pages 161-172.</p>
                    <p>At the same meeting the Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that “organically, there was no connection between
                        Berlin and disarmament negotiations, but in the broadest political sense it
                        was inevitable that these matters should influence each other. A crisis over
                        Berlin would obviously have the gravest implications for disarmament.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> responded that he “could
                        agree that there was no direct connection between disarmament and the Berlin
                        problem, but that they were related.” For text of this portion of the

                            Furtseva, Soviet Minister of Culture.</note> asked why we did not invite
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to attend Goodman
                        concert. I explained I had not done so as this would result in considerable
                        publicity which I had assumed he would wish to avoid in this connection. She
                        urged nevertheless that it would do no harm to ask him, which I did,
                        explaining reason for not having done so earlier for which he expressed
                        understanding and appreciation. He said he would come if Kremlin reception
                        ended early enough. He turned up accompanied by his wife, <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                        and stayed for first half of concert. There being no private box at this
                        theatre, row of seats on raised sector had been hastily cleared for
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> party and he invited
                        my wife and myself to join them there. Audience showed great interest in
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s reaction and he in
                        theirs. <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName> remarked on obvious
                        audience recognition of various numbers and spontaneous applause as they
                        were begun, somewhat in pride at its sophistication. With exception of
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s wife, however,
                        Presidium members had no understanding of jazz and <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> told me afterwards that he did not dance and did not
                        understand jazz but admired skill of musicians. Change in attitude toward
                        jazz during 5 years I have been here is remarkable and <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss>'s presence last night will doubtless be great boon to jazz
                        lovers here.</p>
                    <p>Significance of event is that despite their own lack of understanding and
                        even dislike of jazz music, Soviet leadership has yielded to popular
                        pressure, particularly of Soviet youth. This is probably most striking
                        evidence that public opinion is beginning to play some role in Soviet
                        affairs.</p>

                    <p>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I wish to thank you for your letter of March 9, 1962,
                        requesting the comments of the Department with regard to Senate Concurrent
                        Resolution 63.<note n="2" xml:id="d201fn2">A copy of Fulbright's letter has
                            not been found. For text of the resolution, introduced by Senator
                            Lausche on March 8, but not acted upon by the Committee, see
                            Congressional Record, March 8, 1962, Concurrent Resolutions.</note> This
                        Resolution would request the President to take action to bring before the
                        United Nations a resolution calling for the withdrawal from the Baltic
                        states of the forces of the Soviet Union, the punishment of persons guilty
                        of crimes against the peoples of the Baltic states, and the extension of the
                        principles of self-determination to the Baltic states.</p>
                    <p>The Department of State understands and sympathizes fully with the motives
                        which prompted the submission of Senate Concurrent Resolution 63. We have
                        consistently recognized and upheld the right of the Baltic peoples to
                        national independence and to the enjoyment of all fundamental rights and
                        freedoms. Our interest in their cause is deep and abiding, and the
                        Department of State has given constant attention over <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0471"/>the years to policies and courses of action
                        designed to convey this interest to the peoples of these areas.</p>
                    <p>We do not believe the policy of this Government is at issue in this matter.
                        The real question is how the policy of our Government can most effectively
                        be served. It is our view that such action on the part of the United States
                        as is called for by the resolutions under discussion would not win any
                        sizeable support in the General Assembly. An important reason for this is
                        that the great majority of the United Nations Members do not follow the
                        position of the United States in not recognizing the forced incorporation of
                        the Baltic states into the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Moreover,
                        our action in introducing such a resolution would be regarded by many
                        Members as a “cold war” initiative, and would thus lose much of the support
                        it truly merits. Finally, the defeat of such a resolution in the United
                        Nations would unfortunately be regarded as a real victory for the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <p>In view of these circumstances, the Department of State is forced to
                        recommend against the passage of Senate Concurrent Resolution 63.</p>
                    <p>The Bureau of the Budget advises that, from the standpoint of the
                        Administration's program, there is no objection to the presentation of this
                        report for the consideration of the Committee.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
                    <p>For the Secretary of State:</p>

                        proposing a series of common projects in the exploration of space (<ref target="frus1961-63v06">

                        abortive attempt to reach further agreement in Washington at the beginning
                        of May, <persName corresp="#p_DHL1">Dryden</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BAA1">Blagonravov</persName> resumed their discussions on
                        May 29 at Geneva during the course of the United Nations Outer Space
                        Subcommittee meetings. On June 8 they reached agreement covering cooperation
                        on meteorology, arrangements for measuring the earth's magnetic field, and
                        the use of the U.S. Echo satellite for experiments in telecommunications.

                    <p>Following <persName corresp="#p_DHL1">Dryden</persName>'s return from Geneva,
                        Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName>
                        convened a meeting with representatives of the White House, <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss>, the Defense Department, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, and the Air Force. This meeting reviewed
                        the discussion in Geneva and agreed to propose to the President the
                        following:</p>
                    <p>“1. After a reasonable interval and if no serious objections have been raised
                        by any of the interested agencies, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DHL1">Dryden</persName> will inform Professor <persName corresp="#p_BAA1">Blagonravov</persName> that we have no changes to suggest in their
                        joint memorandum. (The memorandum provided for a two-month waiting period
                        during which either party could propose changes.)</p>
                    <p>“2. Upon notification from Professor <persName corresp="#p_BAA1">Blagonravov</persName> that the Soviets do not desire changes which
                        would be unacceptable to us (or at the conclusion of the two-month waiting
                        period), we will, assuming the Soviets still wish to proceed, exchange notes
                        with the Soviet Government to confirm government-level agreement to these
                        proposals.</p>
                    <p>“3. It was suggested that when that agreement has been obtained, you may wish
                        to write to Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        noting both the agreement to proceed with the specific arrangements at hand
                        and the prospects of further technical discussions on additional topics. A
                        draft of such a letter will be submitted for your approval.</p>
                    <p>“4. Meanwhile, Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName>
                        and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DHL1">Dryden</persName> will report these
                        developments to members of Congress who have a specific interest and
                        responsibility in this field, and the Department will prepare a report to be
                        sent to the Secretary General of the United Nations when formal agreement
                        has been reached with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>“5. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DHL1">Dryden</persName> will, in cooperation
                        with the interested agencies, proceed now to arrange nominations for US
                        membership in the joint US-Soviet working groups which are to develop the
                        detailed implementation of the meteorological and geomagnetic proposals.
                        These working groups will not, however, be activated until formal agreement
                        has been reached with the Soviet Government.</p>

                    <p>“6. The joint <persName corresp="#p_DHL1">Dryden</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_BAA1">Blagonravov</persName> memorandum will be treated as
                        confidential, pending government-level agreement by the Soviets or earlier
                        Soviet public release.</p>
                    <p>“7. After formal agreement has been obtained, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DHL1">Dryden</persName> will arrange directly with Professor <persName corresp="#p_BAA1">Blagonravov</persName> for further technical
                        discussions, possibly in Moscow this fall, concerning broader cooperation in
                        communication via satellites and the possibility of cooperation in such of
                        the remaining topics dealt with in your exchange of letters with Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> as may seem worthwhile
                        to pursue further.” (Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to the President, July 5; Department of State, Central

                    <p>In a June 21, 1962, memorandum to the President on Berlin, Secretary of
                        Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that he felt
                        “certain that our improved military position and our firm response to
                        provocation have had a major influence on Soviet attitudes. From the
                        beginning Khrushchev has <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0474"/>sought to
                        develop his campaign against Berlin in such a way as to avoid serious risk
                        of general war.” While the Soviets were not likely to try to precipitate a

                        continued, neither were they likely to modify their positions to allow a

                    <p>On July 5 the President received a message from Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> which proposed the elimination
                        of Western military forces in Berlin and their replacement by “<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> police military formations” composed of
                        troops from the three Western allies, neutral states, and small Warsaw Pact
                        and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> states. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces would be reduced in size by 25 percent each year and
                        removed by the end of the fourth year. This would happen in the context of
                        an agreement that also solved the larger German issues. A week later
                        Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Soviet
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> discussed

                        previous Soviet positions. On July 17 the President replied to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, stating that what the U.S.
                        found “especially troubling in the present Soviet position is the consistent
                        failure, even in the very formulation of the problem, to take any real

                    <p>DEAR MR. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">GROMYKO</persName>: Upon return from a
                        ten-day absence in Europe, I find that it is now generally known that
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> will be leaving
                        Moscow this summer. The inevitable result will be increasing speculation
                        about his successor. Our Embassy will <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0475"/>shortly request an agrement for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Foy D</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> and I should greatly appreciate your assistance in a
                        prompt response in order that the President may end press speculation
                        through an early announcement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> is well known to high
                        officials of your Government and we are pleased that he will be available
                        for this assignment. A distinguished career officer familiar with the Soviet
                        Union and the Russian language, he has worked on the most intimate terms
                        with President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and me since
                        we assumed office and knows our thinking thoroughly. I need not add that he
                        brings with him the same full confidence of the President which Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> has enjoyed.</p>
                    <p>I hope that the forthcoming conference in Laos will be able to move promptly
                        to a mutually satisfactory conclusion and that we can meet soon in Geneva to
                        sign an agreement which will mark an important step in our relations.<note n="2" xml:id="d205fn2">On July 4 the Embassy in Moscow reported that the

                    <p>A memorandum of July 3, 1962, on the “Cuban Situation,” prepared by the
                        Central Intelligence Agency's Office of Current Intelligence, stated that
                        “Cuba's main difference from the Soviet satellites lies in the absence of an
                        explicit Soviet commitment to defend Cuba militarily.” The memorandum added
                        that “Soviet statements in this sense have thus far been vague and general.”

                    <p>After several invitations to confer with the Ambassador, I finally accepted a
                        luncheon date for July 3rd. He asked me to choose the place and I suggested
                        the Russian Embassy.</p>
                    <p>The luncheon and the after-luncheon talk lasted until about 2:30 p.m.
                        (beginning at 1:00 p.m.).</p>
                    <p>He first spoke of a message he had from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to me, which according to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, was to carry his (<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s) good wishes to me and my
                        family. He also said that he had been asked by <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> to be remembered to me.</p>
                    <p>The first thing he asked about was the economic situation. He wanted to know
                        what I thought of consequences of the stock market collapse—its cause and
                        effect and I told him what I thought, namely, that we were in a bear market
                        of rather definite proportions and it would affect business. It remained to
                        be seen I thought whether it would result in a real lack of confidence which
                        would deeply affect the economy.</p>
                    <p>He was inquisitive about the steel price episode.<note n="2" xml:id="d207fn2">On April 10 Roger Blough, Chairman of the Board of U.S. Steel, had
                            announced a raise in steel prices of $6 per ton. The President regarded
                            this as inflationary and in 3 days convinced Blough to rescind the price
                            raise.</note> I told him I thought the steel action was maladroit but
                        that the President had overreacted. This had been the immediate cause of the
                        sharp realization that with the squeeze on profits, stock prices were far
                        too high. He then asked about the Common Market—why had we been in favor of
                        it and why were we still pressing for its development and Great Britain's
                        entry? Did this not all tend to increase competition for us in the way of
                        business and act also as a dilution of our power position in the world? I
                        replied that with the continuation of the tariff barriers in Western Europe,
                        with the foreshortening of time and travel and the great increase of speed
                        of communication, it was anachronistic to continue with the old system. It
                        was this realization by a number of thinking people which brought it about.
                        We had been called on to participate in two World Wars by reason of
                        German-French tensions and it was natural for us to seek greater stability
                        in this part of the world. Our power might be diluted and the competition
                        might be severe but we were not disposed to keep others weak in order to
                        maintain our position. He indicated that they were puzzled by our attitude
                        in this respect and had a hard time to find an explanation. I told him <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0477"/>I did not think they need seek for
                        any other explanation than what I had indicated.</p>
                    <p>Next he asked about tax reduction—How was it possible with all the threat of
                        a deficit? He was aware of the talk about the beneficial aspects of a
                        deficit but this was hard to believe and particularly difficult to accept in
                        the light of the balance of payments position of the United States. I told
                        him that I thought he had asked a good question. We were in a tight position
                        with the squeeze on profits, with ever-increasing labor costs and our rather
                        savage income tax on both corporations and individuals. It was complicated
                        by the balance of payments problem but the theory was that a reduction of
                        taxes would release money for investment and expansion, introduce more
                        flexibility in our economic system, etc. This stimulation would, in the end,
                        result in just as substantial government revenues and would result in a
                        return to confidence that other governmental measures might fail to produce.
                        I told him I felt our taxes were too high, interfered with incentives and
                        produced all manner of anomalies in commercial transactions. A tax reduction
                        might have a real stimulus but the danger of a larger deficit and its threat
                        to the dollar was in my judgment very real. He then asked about the attitude
                        I had in regard to the extension of nuclear power to other countries. This,
                        said he, troubled them greatly—would this not certainly increase the danger
                        of nuclear war? I said I thought it would and, as I understood it, so did
                        the United States Government. He indicated that he sensed some relaxation of
                        our opposition to such a trend. I said I could only refer him to the
                        Government for the answer to this question. I knew of no such
                        “relaxation.”</p>
                    <p>At this point I said I wanted to ask him some questions but he said he had
                        one more before I began and that was regarding the status of the Disarmament
                        Advisory Committee. What power did it have, whom did it advise and how many
                        times did it meet? I told him all the answers as I saw them, emphasizing its
                        purely advisory capacity, the character of its advice, its composition,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>My first question was as to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s recent statements in regard to China. They were
                        rather rasping and I wondered what they really implied. We had made it clear
                        that we were not going to support any adventures on the part of Chiang on
                        the Mainland. Both <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and the
                        President had indicated that and if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was really trying to reduce dangerous tensions,
                        why did he not indicate the same thing in regard to his support of Red
                        China's incursions against Formosa, Quemoy and Matsu? He replied that it was
                        known that Chiang had real ambitions in regard to the Mainland but they were
                        wholly fanciful as far as Chiang was concerned. They were only serious if
                        the United States supported his ambitions and it was necessary for Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to emphasize Soviet
                        support of their alliance with Red China, if any such attempt was made on
                        the Mainland. This, I said, was understandable but the real <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0478"/>question was whether the Soviet Union
                        really would support Red China if it sought to mount a military effort
                        against Formosa or the islands. He said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had to support Mao's claims to Formosa. It was to
                        be given to China—even the United States had declared this. I said Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could continue to
                        support Red China's claims but not by means of force, and he ought to state
                        this renunciation if he wanted really to reduce tensions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he got the point and I said
                        the failure of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to give
                        any such indication along these lines made the United States wonder just
                        what the extent of the Soviet Union's commitments were in regard to Formosa
                        and the islands. The President had made the United States' position clear
                        and if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was serious
                        about relieving tensions here was a point at which to begin. Beyond
                        acknowledging that I had made the point clear to him, he did not volunteer
                        anything more.</p>
                    <p>Another discussion took place in regard to Berlin. I said I was gaining the
                        impression that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was
                        digging himself in deeper and deeper on the removal of United States troops
                        in Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> must know
                        how important a factor this was in our position and the position of all the
                        Allies. To keep emphasizing this point was endangering a real settlement on
                        Berlin which could be part of a package which might include a number of
                        points of real advantage in the relief of tensions.</p>
                    <p>If Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wanted to diminish
                        the prestige of the United States by demanding the withdrawal of United
                        States troops and the insertion of other troops in West Berlin with no
                        penetration of East Berlin by any foreign troops we would not be getting
                        anywhere according to my view. This is not the time to crystallize positions
                        on this important issue. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        must remember we did not throw the challenge to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> on Berlin. He did, and he heated
                        it up so much we felt impelled to build up our military position. This
                        annoyed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> very much and
                        he stepped up his armament and all this leads us nowhere. There is a real
                        opportunity to work out a solution on Berlin which may not suit Ulbricht but
                        which would relieve tensions but they can't be relieved if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is really trying to get us to
                        back down in Berlin which we will not do. I said this was a matter on which
                        I certainly felt very deeply and I felt the American people did. There was,
                        in my judgment, real danger of war over Berlin if it were not handled
                        temperately and there should never be an effort to force the issue. It
                        carried a terrible danger everytime it was attempted. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he knew this was a sensitive
                        element in our position over Berlin but he did not see why it was that we
                        objected to neutral occupation of West Berlin. The United Nations could do
                        this as it had in the case of the Suez, for example. The danger in Berlin
                        was the confrontation of our two forces. It was the only place in the world
                        where this was so. The necessity was to remove this <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0479"/>danger. The fact that Berlin was surrounded
                        by East Germany did not mean that they would ever be disposed to attempt to
                        overrun the United Nations forces in Berlin. They could never agree to any
                        presence of foreign troops in East Berlin because such a repudiation of the
                        Communist regime by the Soviet Union makes it impracticable.</p>
                    <p>Then, I said, leave the situation as it is with no further attempts to
                        maneuver us out of position. It was not “intolerable.” It was not
                        challenging; people could very well get on in Berlin if it were not for the
                        new challenge. It was, of course, annoying to Ulbricht but who was Ulbricht
                        to allow him to play with fire. If <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> could be gotten rid of, I had the idea the whole
                        situation would be improved greatly.</p>
                    <p>The West Germans would be much more forthcoming in regard to East Germany,
                        etc. He suggested we get rid of Adenauer. I said this might be possible if
                        we had controlled the elections in West Germany as they did in East
                        Germany.</p>
                    <p>I referred to the Wall as a terrible acknowledgment of weakness. This symbol
                        of war and concentration camps was sinister, out of place and a dreadful
                        admission of weakness in that people had to be locked in their own home
                        country to keep them there.</p>
                    <p>He said that it was only natural to erect such a Wall—there were barriers at
                        every border crossing. I said I knew of only one such penitentiary wall on
                        any boundary. He said a number of people in the United States Government had
                        indicated to him that the Wall was a welcome stabilizing factor.</p>
                    <p>I said I did not agree. It was just too unnatural and sinister. It induced
                        violence and hatred. It should be disposed of soon.</p>
                    <p>I then talked to him about disarmament. I said I had come reluctantly to the
                        conclusion that the Soviet was interested in disarmament only as a
                        propaganda weapon. He asked me why I thought this because he thought they
                        had made it clear they were the world's foremost advocate in urging
                        disarmament. I said they had urged it all right but all last summer while
                        they were talking test ban, they were intensively preparing for tests and
                        had not the slightest intention of reaching any agreement on a ban at all.
                        He must understand what distrust this sowed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, at the Black Sea, during my visit with him,<note n="3" xml:id="d207fn3">See <ref target="#d109">Document
                            109</ref>.</note> had accused the United States of secretly preparing
                        for tests while we were negotiating. I had then told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that if he cared to, he could
                        send experts over to our proving grounds to examine into just what we were
                        doing, provided we could do the same with our experts on their side. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said this was not
                        “practicable.” It is now apparent why it was not “practicable” and I did not
                        feel that on this matter Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0480"/>had been frank with me. The Soviet
                        antipathy to a reasonable form of inspection and verification likewise
                        impelled me to believe that the Soviets only wanted the sound of disarmament
                        and not the reality because anyone really desirous of true disarmament must
                        accept as a logical concomitant of it a system of inspection and
                        verification based on something more than faith. It also implied acceptance
                        of some international arbitraments, of which the Soviet representatives all
                        fought shy. Furthermore, I said, I had never talked with any national leader
                        who talked so much about his weapons as did Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. He seemed enamored of them; it was like a farmer
                        with a new set of tractors or farm implements. These were my reasons for
                        disillusionment regarding the true intent of Soviet disarmament
                        proposals.</p>
                    <p>He said he had to admit the testing last summer did cast doubts on Soviet
                        intentions regarding the test ban negotiations but they did wish disarmament
                        and perhaps the best thing to do now was reach an agreement on disarmament
                        in space. It was a field not yet preempted and though it might not have
                        great immediate military implications, it might be something definite and
                        helpful toward other agreements. I said I felt it was a thing which we ought
                        to attempt and accomplish quickly and decisively.</p>
                    <p>He said it might also lead to fruitful cooperation in the space field and I
                        said I thought this would be highly desirable. He then talked of a test ban
                        agreement indicating he thought the general and complete disarmament plan
                        carried implications that neither side might want to adopt for the time
                        being. Why did we not agree to a ban in all elements relying on national
                        detection systems only but doing what we wished to do by way of
                        preparation?</p>
                    <p>We might not detect all underground explosions. He thought it could be done.
                        His scientists thought they knew about all United States underground tests
                        and he felt sure we could detect any they exploded. I said our experts
                        vigorously disagreed; that with our type of society the Soviet Union could
                        rely on getting information of such testing much more readily than we could
                        from the Soviet Union. Why this pathology regarding inspection? Why is it so
                        bad? Why is it that this is such a stumbling block to actual
                        accomplishments? He did not answer these questions directly but always
                        stressed Soviet proposals for reliance on national observance systems as the
                        best method of attack leaving it to each government to use as much effort as
                        it wanted to in the way of preparation for tests in case of a breach by the
                        other side. I said this was playing in the dark which always gave rise to
                        suspicion and it did not appeal to me as being constructive. Throughout our
                        talk on disarmament I gained the impression he believed in tackling some
                        things that could be done rather promptly leaving the general and complete
                        disarmament and all its ramifications to a later stage.</p>
                    <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0481"/>
                    <p>I said that this was just what we were advocating but the Russians at Geneva
                        seemed to be taking the position through Zorin that it was all or nothing.
                        If this was a change in the Soviet position, I thought the United States
                        would be glad to respond.</p>
                    <p>I asked whether it made sense to continue to go on talking at Geneva going
                        round and round the mulberry bush. Was it too much to ask whether there was
                        any present desire for a disarmament program on the part of the Soviet Union
                        which would not significantly increase Russian strength in relation to
                        ours?</p>
                    <p>Why I asked did the reversal on war propaganda take place at Geneva? What
                        harm could have come from agreeing to a ban on it? Was this Chinese
                        pressure? Was it because Red China decried the abandonment of the doctrine
                        that war was inevitable between the Communist and the Free World? I'd like
                        to know and I'm sure the world would like to know. He indicated he did not
                        know the answers to these questions and I did not press.</p>
                    <p>He then asked me why there seemed to be such deep hostility to the United
                        Nations among the Congress and the people. He had the feeling as did most
                        members of the Soviet Union that the United Nations was controlled by the
                        United States, so why get mad at it. It had stood in the way of innumerable
                        Soviet policies yet it had become an institution of great distrust in the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>Why was this? Why was it that the Southwest seemed to be particularly
                        hostile? Why does the Birch Society have such strength in that area? I told
                        him not to mistake some senatorial and extreme right criticism of the United
                        Nations as representative of general feeling. I had heard that the Gallup
                        polls had indicated a very wide support of the United Nations in the United
                        States. I thought the criticism of the United Nations came largely from the
                        frequent use of the Soviet veto and the fear that irresponsible and immature
                        nations may form blocs or groups which would induce irresponsible and
                        perhaps dangerous action but the general support of the United Nations in
                        spite of frustrations was still deep-seated in the United States.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the visit, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was
                        affable, courteous and gave the impression of being rather frank and
                        forthcoming. The text will show, however, that he did not open the door to
                        any major developments in our relations with his country. He indicated he
                        would like to call on me in New York. He also asked my advice as to where he
                        could go in the summer relatively nearby “but where it was a little cooler
                        than Virginia.”</p>

                    <p>On July 6, 1962, the intelligence community issued National Intelligence
                        Estimate 11-8-62, “Soviet Capabilities for Long Range Attack,” which sought
                        “to estimate probable trends in the strength and deployment of Soviet weapon
                        systems suitable for long range attack” over the next 5 years. The estimate
                        concluded, among other things, that the Soviets were placing greater
                        emphasis “on forces for intercontinental attacks, especially <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s” and were “attempting to improve their
                        capabilities for both preemptive and retaliatory action, by measures
                        designed to shorten reaction times and increase survivability.” The estimate
                        noted further that, given the quickening tempo of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program, “the present relatively modest
                        force level of about 50 operational launchers will probably grow
                        substantially, reaching some 125-175 launchers in mid-1963 and 200-300 in
                        mid-1964.” The estimate also concluded that “with the long range striking
                        forces we estimate it will have in the mid-1960's, however, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could not expect to destroy the hardened,
                        airborne, seaborne, and fast reaction nuclear delivery capabilities of the
                        US.” For text of the estimate and the report of the Special

                    <p>On July 7, 1962, the Department of Defense released preliminary results of a
                        seismic research program, Project Vela, which implied that seismic detection
                        and identification of nuclear tests was perhaps easier to carry out than
                        earlier studies had indicated. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAH1">Dean</persName>, arriving in Geneva July 14, reportedly said at the

                        inside the Soviet Union might not be necessary if the United States could
                        get non-nuclear nations to cooperate. Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Acting Arms Control and Disarmament

                    <p>56. President First Nat City Bank Moore reports <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> told him July 5 A) <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> anxious increase trade with US. B) Berlin constitutes
                        major obstacle to expanded US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> business
                        relations. C) Berlin settlement would be reached. D) <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> short of foreign exchange. E) <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> eager sell raw materials to US at or
                        under world prices. F) Long or short term credits desired.</p>
                    <p>At Embassy suggestion Moore asked to see “best plant behind Urals.” After
                        Soviets unsuccessfully attempted substitute Donbas visit, Moore flew July 6
                        to Sverdlovsk, thence by small plane via Chelyabinsk to Magnitogorsk for
                        five hour tour world's largest iron-steel plant.</p>
                    <p>Moore noted A) “dispersal” of vast industrial complex from Sverdlovsk to
                        Magnitogorsk. B) Huge open pit mines at Chelyabinsk and Magnitogorsk. C)
                        General accuracy of Kish “Economic Atlas of <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>” which he used openly in plane to identify industrial
                        plants, pipelines, power lines. D) Magnitogorsk plant currently produces 10
                        million tons steel and expansion to 15 mt underway. E) Plant operates under
                        three 8-hour shifts, seven days weekly. F) No surplus labor apparent,
                        workers paid average 200 rubles monthly or about double Moscow factories. G)
                        Magnitogorsk iron ore reserves half depleted, concentration has dropped from
                        65 percent to 35 percent, but other nearby deposits more than adequate. H)
                        Much new construction underway (uncompleted) in Ural area. I) Plant
                        producing inter alia steel plate for gas lines. J) Hosts claimed <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> produces 40-inch pipe. K) Heavy security
                        precautions, plane followed same circuitous course to and from Sverdlovsk.
                        At request Magnitogorsk director, Moore pointed out shortcomings in plant,
                        principally “maintenance.” “No American company is rich enough to treat
                        equipment like you do”. Hosts agreed state should permit plant retain more
                        profits for maintenance and depreciation.</p>

                    <p>DEAR SENATOR KEATING: I want to thank you for your communication of June 21
                        requesting information on the situation of the Jews in the Soviet Union for
                        an organization of your constituents deeply concerned with this
                            problem.<note n="2" xml:id="d211fn2">Attached, but not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0485"/>
                    <p>The Department can well appreciate and shares your constituents' distress
                        about the news which has been coming from the Soviet Union with its
                        unfortunate implications for the status of Soviet Jewry. The Department has
                        given considerable thought to this serious problem.</p>
                    <p>I am sure you are well aware of the increasing evidence of interference in
                        recent years with the Jewish religion in the U.S.S.R. which has been
                        publicized by the national press services, newspapers and other information
                        media, and such organizations as the Synagogue Council of America, B'nai
                        B'rith and Jewish Minorities Research. The desecration of cemeteries,
                        closing of synagogues, dispersing of prayer meetings, arrests of lay
                        leaders, and the prohibition of certain Jewish religious practices have been
                        well established.</p>
                    <p>It is not clear from the available information whether police action against
                        various individual Jews has its actual basis in anti-Semitism or whether
                        this arises from the presently intensified campaign of the Soviet
                        authorities to stamp out black marketeering, speculation and other economic
                        crimes involving illegal manufacturing, theft or misappropriation of state
                        property, bribery of officials, and other chronic abuses. The majority of
                        the Jews arrested have been accused of such acts, considered criminal under
                        Soviet law, and susceptible to harsh sentences up to and including capital
                        punishment.</p>
                    <p>It is likewise not possible to determine whether Soviet Jews are deliberately
                        being singled out as Jews for a disproportionate amount of condemnation and
                        victimization. However, a number of the Soviet press accounts of these cases
                        have been written in such a manner as to reflect anti-Semitic attitudes by
                        the authors who hardly would have written in this vein unless they
                        anticipated at least tacit approval of this line by Soviet authorities. The
                        same newspaper accounts, however, which have given prominence to Soviet
                        citizens with Jewish names alleged to have been involved in illegal
                        commercial activities usually have listed Soviet offenders of non-Jewish
                        backgrounds as well. The Soviet newspaper Sovetskaya Kirgiziya of March 25,
                        1962, in giving a further report about the exposure of widespread illegal
                        economic operations in Frunze reported originally to have involved 54
                        offenders, listed the names of 33 persons, 15 of whom had identifiable
                        Jewish names.</p>
                    <p>The long-term Soviet campaign against religion generally and individual
                        religious groups and organizations in particular, although varying in
                        intensity at times, continues unabated. In the post-Stalin period, the major
                        emphases in this campaign have been on intensified atheistic and
                        anti-religious propaganda, the increased application of social pressures,
                        non-violent if sometimes repugnant forms of “persuasion,” administrative
                        restrictions and legal impediments (as in the case of the Moscow ban on
                        matzoth baking) and occasional trials of religious figures or members of
                        religious minorities on ordinary criminal charges. <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0486"/>Such trials, publicized so as to discredit
                        both the individuals involved and, indirectly, the religions they represent,
                        also seem intended to coerce or intimidate by example the victims'
                        co-religionists.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet publication “Party Life” of May 9, 1962, confirms that the
                        Communist Party of the Soviet Union has stepped up the anti-religious
                        activities since the 22nd Party and social organizations have recently
                        strengthened what is described as “scientific-religious propaganda”; that
                        religious sects have been dissolved and that there has been an increase in
                        the number of people who have renounced religious beliefs. Allegedly at the
                        request of former believers, many churches and prayer houses have been
                        closed. The article hints that believers may be prosecuted under the Soviet
                        criminal code in the statement that in violation of Soviet legislation, the
                        leaders of cults engage in religious propaganda beyond the limits of their
                        religious buildings, organize religious rites in the apartments of
                        believers, and attract children to attend services in prayer houses. The
                        standard anti-religious techniques are described as radio and television
                        broadcasts, motion pictures, public lectures, and individual work among
                        believers.</p>
                    <p>The above methods have not succeeded in stamping out religious beliefs and
                        practices in the Soviet Union. Despite the reports of more forceful action
                        against Soviet Jewry, and other religious groups, it still does not seem
                        that the Soviet authorities have decided to return on a large scale to the
                        extremely repressive methods employed against religious groups and racial
                        minorities during the Stalin era.</p>
                    <p>We have given serious consideration to the request that the Soviet Government
                        be approached on this problem. The situation of the Jews in the Soviet Union
                        was brought to the attention of the Soviet Government several times in the
                        past, with little positive result. At the time of the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> visit in September 1959 the
                        Department asked Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> to give serious and sympathetic consideration to
                        requests by representatives of American Jewish organizations to arrange a
                        private meeting with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.
                        While no such meeting was arranged, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> did bring this matter to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s attention during the Camp
                            David discussions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> indicated his awareness of the question but
                        stated that the Jewish people in the Soviet Union are treated like everyone
                        else. The President told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> of the concern that had been expressed to him by
                        representatives of the Jewish people in the United States over the situation
                        of the Jews in the Soviet Union. On September 26, 1959, former Secretary of
                        State Herter, in a meeting with the Soviet Foreign Minister, said he wanted
                        to bring to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s attention
                        the concern which was felt in the United States with respect to the status
                        of Jews in the U.S.S.R. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>,
                        however, replied that this was an internal matter for the Soviet
                        Government.</p>
                    <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0487"/>
                    <p>It is very difficult for our Government to contribute to the direct solution
                        of the problems of minorities in a territory where a foreign sovereign
                        government exercises full control. Further, and more importantly, it is
                        doubtful if further protestations would be helpful to the Jews in the Soviet
                        Union. The Soviet Government has accused Soviet Jews of being under the
                        influence of foreign governments, including the United States. Further
                        intervention concerning the problems of the Jewish minority in the U.S.S.R.
                        might well redound to the disadvantage of Soviet Jewry.</p>
                    <p>There are, however, widely recognized goals and standards in the field of
                        human rights, such as those expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human
                            Rights.<note n="3" xml:id="d211fn3">For text of this declaration,
                            December 10, 1948, see <hi rend="italic">A Decade of American Foreign
                                Policy: Basic Documents, 1941-1949</hi>, pp. 564-567.</note> The
                        force of world opinion has become an important factor to discourage certain
                        governments from pursuing policies which result in the persecution of their
                        own nationals on religious and other grounds. The United States naturally
                        looks with favor on activities by organizations and private individuals
                        which effectively bring such persecution to the notice of world opinion.</p>
                    <p>In accordance with the principles set forth in the Charter of the United
                        Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Department
                        strongly condemns all Soviet violations of human rights and fundamental
                        freedoms. As a result of United States initiative, the Commission on Human
                        Rights has decided to include information from nongovernmental organizations
                        in consultative status in its next series of periodic reports, which will
                        cover the years 1960-62. The reports deal with human rights developments in
                        member states of the U.N. and may therefore provide an opportunity for
                        presenting data on the Soviet repression of religious and minority groups
                        for consideration by the Human Rights Commission.</p>

                    <p>At 4 p.m. on July 12, 1962, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> discussed Germany, Berlin, and other topics at the
                        Secretary's Office. For text of the memorandum of their conversation on
                        Berlin and Germany, see <ref target="frus1961-63v15">
                            <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961-1963, volume XV</ref>,
                        pages 215-222. During the discussion on Berlin the “Secretary noted the
                        problem of signaling our intentions in such a way as not to create the
                        danger of interpreting these as a willingness to yield on vital points.
                        Referring to the Captive Nations Resolution, the Secretary suggested that,
                        from the point of view of managing these things here with a minimum of
                        controversy in our own country, it was better for the President to handle
                        the subject in a low key. But if this were interpreted in the wrong way in
                        Moscow, it would get into the wrong context. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> commented that a decision by Congress did not mean
                        that the President must act. The Secretary agreed that there was no way
                        under the Constitution by which the Congress could make action by the
                        President compulsory. But the President had to think of his relations with
                        the Congress and the effect on his entire legislative program. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said a strong Soviet reaction was
                        certain. This was a matter which could not help relations between the two
                        countries and was a permanent source of difference.” (Memorandum of

                        that a source of misunderstanding between the two countries had been the
                        discussion following the President's interview with Stewart Alsop in an
                        issue of the <hi rend="italic">Saturday Evening Post</hi> some months ago.
                        Soviet propaganda had stressed, on the basis of this interview, the
                        intention of the US to make a preventive attack on the Soviet Union. Press
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName> had clarified the
                        related statement in the article immediately. This, the Secretary noted, had
                        not been a direct quotation of the President. What Salinger said is what the
                        US has been saying for 15 years. If there is a massive attack on Western
                        Europe, we will defend ourselves. There is nothing strange in that. If the
                        Soviet misinterpretation is merely a matter of propaganda, we can understand
                        that. If, however, the Soviet Union really believes that we are preparing a
                        preventive attack, that is more serious.</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said the Soviet Union did
                        believe this. It was not just a matter of one article. For many years there
                        had been many articles and many statements by persons in authority. Many
                        Generals had said that the US had bombs that would destroy and would be
                        dropped on the Soviet Union. Then there is the question of the <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> alert. What could the Soviet leaders be
                        expected to believe when statements of this kind were made not just by
                        journalists but by Generals—people with real authority in their hands to
                        begin war. If the US Government wants to stop such <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0489"/>statements it can certainly do so. Then the
                        President himself appears in a magazine discussing the possibility of an
                        attack on the Soviet Union. The Soviet concern was therefore not just
                        propaganda. ‘We are really worried about this.’ Perhaps the US thinks that
                        the Soviet Union is too suspicious, but maps appear in magazines showing the
                        planes and missiles allocated for the destruction of each city in the Soviet
                        Union. This information obviously could only come from authoritative
                        sources. There is nothing comparable in the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>“The Secretary asked how many bombs <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had said would be required to destroy the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> indicated six or seven. He noted that this story
                        had begun with a conversation with Churchill who had said he did not want
                        war because six or seven bombs would be enough to destroy the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had been present at this conversation. The
                        Secretary had observed that the present Administration has taken steps to
                        bring speeches under control. He referred to the recent hearings on the
                        subject conducted by Senator Stennis. It had to be conceded that there was
                        plenty said on both sides. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        referred again to the American Generals. The Secretary commented that he did
                        not get much comfort from speeches by Marshal Malinovsky. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he only made one or two
                        a year. In any event this was a reason why the Soviet Union was forced to
                        increase its arms expenditures. Its reaction to American statements was not
                        just propaganda. The Soviet Union had to be prepared.” (Memorandum of
                        conversation; Department of State, Central Files, 611.61/7-1262)</p>
                    <p>Also during the discussion, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        said that, “as to nuclear tests, the Soviet Union had felt that the United
                        States had been ahead. It had then caught up, and now the United States was
                        testing again. This was a vicious circle.” <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> observed “that he had been sorry to see that
                        Khrushchev, in his recent speech, had come back to the point that any kind
                        of inspection was tantamount to espionage.” (Memorandum of conversation;

                    <p>Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> also: “referred
                        to a comment which he had made before his recent European trip to the effect
                        that, in all the discussions on the Common Market, there was no indication
                        that these arrangements were being directed toward the Eastern Bloc or
                        Socialist camp. This was certainly his impression after his recent trip.
                        Western Europe was not concerned with economic warfare. It was quite
                        prepared, and we hope we can be prepared, to increase trade.</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked about the future of US
                        trade with the Soviet Union in view of Congressional attitudes. The
                        Secretary observed that the prejudice of our policy favors trade. We are a
                        trading nation, and we trade unless there is a reason not to. In his recent
                        speech <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0490"/>referred to post-1946 military
                        expenditures. He wished that there were some people in the Soviet Union
                        assigned, perhaps as war-games, to the task of telling the Soviet leaders
                        how Americans thought about things. In 1946 we had greatly reduced the US
                        armed forces. Not a division or air unit was ready for combat. Our Defense
                        budget was about 10 billion dollars. Now it is over four times that much.
                        Why did this come about? It started with Soviet policies during the
                        Stalinist period, the Greek experience etc. The major jump had come at the
                        time of the Korean war. If <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        had not insisted on greatly reducing or eliminating our position in Berlin
                        last summer, the subsequent increase in our forces would not have occurred.
                        If Stalin had not pushed in his time, the US would be disarmed today for all
                        practical purposes. Because of pressures on Berlin, we have strengthened our
                        forces. The Soviets became alarmed and strengthened their forces, and all
                        this in relation to Berlin.</p>
                    <p>“The President would like to move on trade but people who are opposed to
                        trade with the Soviets are nourished by pressures on Berlin.</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said for the Soviets the
                        Common Market was aimed at creating a deeper split between East and West
                        Europe. The US was a leading member of the Western society. That is why the
                        Soviet Union believed nothing good for the Eastern countries will come from
                        the Common Market. The Secretary commented that we are not members of the
                        Common Market. Dobrynin observed that the US could influence it. This was
                        why he had asked his original question about US trade with the Eastern
                        countries. In view of the sad background of that trade, his country felt
                        that the Common Market would have a very bad impact.” (Memorandum of

                            Zhukov</persName> took me aside for farewell talk. He expressed opinion
                        our relations were particularly bad at this time. He said President's
                        failure to send message to Peace Congress<note n="2" xml:id="d213fn2">The

                        with statements in US implying possibility preventive <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0491"/>war had made very bad impression here. He
                        pointed out this Congress had allowed full expression of different points of

                        help and was faced with strong opposition to his policies. He thought some

                        to reach agreement on testing I said I had always assumed that on this issue
                        Soviets were particularly concerned about possible spread of nuclear weapons
                        to Chinese and West Germans and I had also assumed that Chinese had made
                        clear their unwillingness to go along with any agreement. <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> replied with some heat and great
                        emphasis that Soviet Union wanted test ban agreement and neither Chinese nor
                        anyone else would prevent them from concluding one. I said there appeared to
                        be some hope that results of Project Vela would make easier solution of
                        problem of observation posts but it was clear that in cases of doubt on-site
                        inspection would be necessary. <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> replied he was aware of this problem and it could be

                        reported in following telegrams. This message deals with disarmament and
                        military matters.</p>
                    <p>In reply to question about his trip north, <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss>
                        said he had observed naval exercises including submarine firing missiles
                        from underwater. He said naval exercise had been carried out in which among
                        other things Soviet submarine was to penetrate Soviet defenses. Submarine
                        was spotted and dummy bomb dropped. It was subsequently discovered that
                        submarine in question not Soviet and he assumed it was either ours or
                        British. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said in time of war nothing could
                        live on water because of modern weapons. Only submarines were of value and
                        even these vulnerable. He said what modern science had been able accomplish
                        was “awful” in real sense of word. He made this remark not in effort to
                        frighten or threaten anyone. He said he always told his military people
                        whenever they showed him some new development that they must realize other
                        side not stupid and able accomplish same thing. He said level of science in
                        both countries about same and what one could do, other could also do.</p>
                    <p>Throughout conversation <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> made many references
                        to <gloss target="#t_U21">U-2</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In discussing disarmament I said I could not understand why Soviets had not
                        given serious consideration to our zonal plan of inspection. I said this was
                        serious effort on our part to meet their preoccupation with secrecy and to
                        meet their insistence that amount of inspection be related to amount of
                        disarmament. Our whole effort in this field seemed breaking down because of
                        Soviet obsession with secrecy which I believe based on outmoded analysis. I
                        cited Telstar as latest evidence world shrinking and said whatever advantage
                        they had from secrecy wasting asset. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss>
                        responded it might be true they gave too much attention and importance to
                        secrecy but said on our side our military obsessed with desire acquire ever
                        more information. He said of course every country had spies but sending
                            <gloss target="#t_U21">U-2</gloss> across frontier was essentially act
                        of war. We wanted to <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0493"/>know where
                        their rocket bases were but these like anything else could be camouflaged. I
                        said it was natural human trait to fear unknown but pointed out this not to
                        their advantage since it caused our military to prepare to meet threats
                        which might not exist. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said he was more
                        concerned now with use of outer space than with planes but said his own
                        people had shown him photos (not clear whether from planes or satellites but
                        I inferred latter) showing airfield or factories and even planes on field,
                        but not showing what purpose of planes was or what factories produced.
                        Always possible conceal essential information.</p>
                    <p>With regard to our zonal proposal <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said there
                        were only limited number of Soviet rocket bases and we knew where they are.
                        It would therefore be simple for us to arrange to inspect them all. He did
                        not seem convinced by my counter arguments that if disarmament were 30
                        percent in first stage, only 30 percent of zones could be inspected. He said
                        essence of disarmament problem was that we wanted to take away weapon with
                        which they could hit us while preserving our overseas bases for use against
                        them. I pointed out that in our first stage they would retain 70 percent of
                        their missiles but he said in order know what 30 percent reduction was we
                        would have to know what their total strength was, and pushed aside my
                        argument that this would not involve inspection of all of them.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> began discussion of test ban by asking
                        Sobolev <note n="2" xml:id="d214fn2"> Arkady A. Sobolev, Soviet Deputy
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs.</note> whether their announcement of
                        resumption had been published. When answered in affirmative he said they
                        would begin about August 5 or 6—he could not remember exact date. Soviets
                        had resumed testing only because of our actions in military field. He added
                        however somewhat cryptically that he understood President's action. He hoped
                        that as result of our experiments we would now be able to conclude test ban,
                        implication being after their next series was completed. I observed there
                        appeared to be hope that as result of our new studies it might be possible
                        to agree not to have permanent observation posts but it would still be
                        necessary to have verification of suspicious events. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> brushed this aside saying that we could detect anything from
                        outside and he cited fact that Soviets had conducted unannounced underground
                        test in last series which we had detected and publicized. He said same true
                        of French test which I gathered Soviets had detected. He said test agreement
                        could be reached but he did not think Pentagon wanted it.</p>
                    <p>From nature of conversation I gathered <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> had
                        little hope that disarmament agreement can be reached.</p>
                    <p>He said, for example, that greatest problem was fact that we have many vested
                        interests in arms race and our monopolists would prevent <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0494"/>agreement. I replied this was absurd and
                        that what he called monopolists knew as well as anyone else that arms race
                        was dangerous and war would hit them as well as anyone else. I added we had
                        many interesting projects and needs which would require all our resources.
                        It was true sudden disarmament would cause dislocations but we were
                        confident we could deal with them. I expressed opinion military people on
                        both sides responsible for security of country prudently always tended give
                        other side maximum capability and worst intentions but it would be tragic if
                        we let this determine our overall policy, and that arms race was not only
                        vast economic waste but also cause of dangerous tensions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said Soviet 7 year plan would be fulfilled
                        whether or not there was disarmament and said plan had been based on
                        assumption there would not be. If disarmament achieved they would probably
                        complete plan by end of five years.</p>
                    <p>I brought up subject of prevention war by accident or miscalculation saying
                        we had taken many unilateral steps in this field but others called for which
                        required cooperation of both sides and I hoped Soviets would pursue this
                        problem with us. I indicated agreement but did not pursue matter.<note n="3" xml:id="d214fn3">As <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> was

                        conversation—miscellaneous. Speaking of his northern trip, <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said he had spent much time inspecting fishing
                        industry and remarked they were going to expand their fishing fleet. He said
                        there were lots of fish near our shores and he laughingly remarked that our
                            <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0495"/>press devoted lots of attention
                        to their trawlers which were really there for fish. In this connection he
                        said they were considering basing 4 or 5 boats on Cuba if Castro agreed
                        since there were good fishing grounds in this area.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> referred with admiration to our Telstar
                        satellite. In this connection I said he had done much to bring Soviet Union
                        into modern world and Telstar showed how necessary this was. I said
                        impossible for any people to live in isolation in world of today. I
                        therefore thought support both sides had given exchange program very wise. I
                        said there were still many areas of misunderstanding between us and this
                        could only be dispelled by greater knowledge through closer contact. Many of
                        our problems were difficult enough to resolve, but they became more
                        difficult when each side started with different appraisal of facts, and I
                        gave some illustrations of this.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said in South Vietnam we had stumbled into
                        bog and would be mired down there for long time. People were against
                            <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> who was bad man. He cited
                        article by <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Chester Bowles</persName> which he
                        alleged indicated we were supporting unpopular govt and said he agreed with
                        much of article.<note n="2" xml:id="d215fn2">Presumably <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is referring to <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>' address before the National
                            Conference on Economic and Social Development, July 19, which was
                            printed in Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> August
                            6, 1962, pp. 207-213.</note> I said we were convinced it was not South
                        Vietnamese who were making trouble but agents from North Vietnam and that if
                        this intervention stopped and Vietnamese wanted change their govt I felt
                        sure we would not stop them. When <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said he
                        had not sent agents in, I said I had not accused him of this but said they
                        came from North Vietnam. He also alleged that our troops had gone into
                        Thailand to bolster up unpopular regime there. He also referred to Iran as
                        country where people would eventually assert themselves. He said Sov Govt
                        was behaving correctly and cited case of Afghanistan. He said their
                        engineers and other personnel had been given strict instructions not even to
                        mention word communism and their relations with that country were excellent.
                        He said King of Afghanistan would pay him visit while he was on holiday.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said in what was by implication frank
                        admission that it was customary Soviet practice, that they had sent no
                        agitators or agents to US because they knew this waste of time and our govt
                        was secure. He said for same reason Allen Dulles had not sent subversive
                        agents to Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> expressed great satisfaction at settlement
                        Laos problem and said both he and President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had honestly carried out their promises.</p>
                    <p>He said they had reestablished good relations with Yugoslavia although they
                        still had disagreements, but history would decide which of two correct. He
                        also used this expression in arguing for coexistence with <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0496"/>US. I said he should not deceive himself
                        that we did not have confidence in our system and we were quite prepared to
                        leave verdict to history. I said Communist system had certain advantages but
                        overall we thought ours better. I said important difference between us
                        however was we thought each country should have its own system and this
                        might be any combination of either their or our economic, political or
                        social systems. I said I was aware that dogmatism and revisionism had
                        special meaning in Communist world but said any system which did not adapt
                        itself to changes in world could not survive.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> referred to Congo and said this also was bog
                        and it would take many years for African countries to evolve into real
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>When I expressed satisfaction at <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> appointment as my successor and referred to his close
                        relationship with President <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said he had met
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> but did not know him well
                        enough to express any opinion. He would welcome him and endeavor to
                        establish good relations.<note n="3" xml:id="d215fn3">In a final telegram
                            reporting on the conversation, <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> added that the Chairman asked him to speak to
                            the President about U.S. harassment of Soviet ships. <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> indicated that he believed
                            the United States was paying too high a price for whatever value it
                            gained from identifying Soviet vessels and pointed out that this was the

                    <p>At a July 26, 1962, meeting of the Committee of Principals, Arms Control and
                        Disarmament Agency Director Foster stated that recent findings held “some
                        hope for modification of the present U.S. position on a nuclear test ban.”
                        He continued, “the fundamental question is whether, in contrast to continued
                        ‘leapfrogging’ of tests, the national interest is best served by taking
                        advantage of technical improvements in order to propose a treaty that might
                        be more acceptable to the Soviet Union.” Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> “stated that he believed that if
                        we could be certain that the Soviet Union would stop testing, we should do
                        so. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> had no reservations
                        about this.” Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                        proposed as an alternative that the United States say to the Soviets that
                        “we would like to work on a comprehensive treaty but that we are <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0497"/>aware of the Soviet position on on-site
                        inspection,” then tell them that, “for our own part, we want to make a start
                        somewhere, so we propose starting with an atmospheric treaty and making it
                        comprehensive as soon as possible.” For text of the memorandum of
                        conversation, see <ref target="frus1961-63v07">

                    <p>On August 1 the President met with a small group of advisers to discuss the
                        nuclear test ban issue. According to a memorandum prepared by Director of
                        Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>,
                            “<persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> and Lovett strongly
                        urged the President not to engage in detailed negotiations until and unless
                        the Soviets change their position on zero on-site inspections and indicated
                        that there existed a climate which would permit negotiation. I strongly
                        supported this recommendation. It was agreed that we should follow this
                        course.” At a larger advisory meeting that followed the same day, the
                        earlier decision was ratified but, according to <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>'s memorandum, “a difference arose between <persName corresp="#p_DAH1">Arthur Dean</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, the latter favoring immediate
                        acceptance of an atmospheric ban but Dean maintaining that this should be a
                        holding position and we should exhaust the possibilities of a comprehensive
                        ban before proceeding with a discussion of an atmospheric ban.” For text,
                        see ibid., pages 531-533.</p>
                    <p>In telegram Todis 469, August 3, the Department of State transmitted its
                        instructions to the U.S. delegation to the disarmament conference in Geneva:
                        “The United States should declare its willingness to discuss a comprehensive
                        test ban treaty involving internationally-supervised national control posts,
                        including some on Soviet soil and involving a possible reduction in the
                        number of on-site inspections.” However, the delegation was to avoid
                        negotiating the precise arrangements for international supervision until the
                        Soviet Union accepted the principle of on-site inspections. “If the Soviet
                        Union continues to indicate unwillingness to accept obligatory on-site
                        inspections on Soviet soil, the United States should be ready to discuss
                        affirmatively an atmospheric-outer space-underwater test ban treaty,
                        possibly around the latter part of August, taking the position that the
                        Soviet refusal to agree to on-site inspection makes it necessary to go to
                        this type of treaty.” For text, see ibid., pages 534-535.</p>

                    <p>76. For the Secretary from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d217fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> was en route to
                            Washington.</note> Reflecting upon my talk with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> have following conclusions:</p>
                    <p>(1) Am more convinced than ever that he at least does not intend push Berlin
                        question to point of real risk of war. Much will depend, however, upon
                        attitude his colleagues and allies as well as upon how we handle the matter.
                        Believe line taken by President and your representation of our case at
                        Geneva was just right but suggest we must be extremely careful on the one
                        hand to show we are serious in our determination to defend Berlin and on
                        other to avoid engaging their prestige particularly in the military field as
                        they are unbelievably sensitive about this. I think, for example, we should
                        for the present play down any boasts about our military superiority and in
                        Berlin itself avoid any action that could be considered by them as annoyance
                        on our part. At same time we should proceed vigorously with contingency
                        planning which they will know about but without publicity.</p>
                    <p>I believe <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is likely to
                        bring Berlin problem before U.N and probably will personally present Soviet
                        case. Suggest we should be thinking about how to prevent neutrals from
                        proposing compromise solutions unacceptable to us and from giving him
                        impression he can proceed with his plans with strong support from world
                        opinion. I have some thoughts on this to put before you upon my return.</p>
                    <p>(2) Even if we are willing to give up insistence upon having control posts
                        inside Soviet Union I do not think <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will agree to more than one or two verifications
                        of test ban a year and probably none. He is obsessed with idea we want to
                        locate his missiles but probably more important he wants to conceal his
                        relative weakness.</p>
                    <p>(3) The mere fact that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        asserted he could achieve his seven year plan without disarmament convinces
                        me that the opposite is the case but I doubt that we will get anywhere on
                        real disarmament at this time. I got impression, however, that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will be prepared seriously to
                        consider steps to prevent war by accident or miscalculation. If we can get
                        over the Berlin hump and then let him know our intelligence capabilities we
                        might make progress on <gloss target="#t_GCD1">GCD</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>National Intelligence Estimate 85-2-62, “The Situation and Prospects in
                        Cuba,” issued on August 1, 1962, expressed the view that “by force of

                        more deeply committed to preserve and strengthen the <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> regime.” The estimate noted, however,
                        that the Soviet Union had “avoided any formal commitment to protect and
                        defend the regime in all contingencies.” It repeated the intelligence
                        community's earlier view that Cuban military capabilities were “essentially
                        defensive.” “We believe it unlikely that the Bloc will provide Cuba with the
                        capability to undertake major independent military operations overseas. We

                    <p>DEAR <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">ORVILLE</persName>: In your letter of July
                            10<note n="2" xml:id="d219fn2">Not printed. (Ibid.) In another letter to

                            agricultural exchange involving the Soviet Minister of Agriculture.
                            Freeman told the Ambassador that the Department of Agriculture would be
                            happy to cooperate in the exchange, subject to overall political
                            determinations. (Ibid., 511.613/7-3062)</note> you called my attention
                        to a conversation in which the Soviet Ambassador raised the possibility of
                        an exchange of agricultural delegations on the ministerial level. You may
                        recall my advice in our later telephone conversation that you should be
                        quite friendly and receptive to such an idea.</p>
                    <p>You will be interested to know that the Agricultural and Cultural Counselors
                        of the Soviet Embassy called at the Department of State on Friday afternoon,
                        July 27,<note n="3" xml:id="d219fn3">A memorandum of their conversation with

                            <persName corresp="#p_PKG1">K.C. Pysin</persName>, would visit the
                        United States in September for four weeks. The Soviet officials further
                        proposed that the delegation total six <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0500"/>persons; that the tour include visits to agricultural
                        colleges and experiment stations, and the observation of the extension
                        service and county agent system; and that the group observe general farming,
                        including grain, vegetables and fruit, and visit various agricultural areas,
                        particularly the North Central states.</p>
                    <p>I hope that you will consider whether you can receive this Soviet delegation
                        and prepare a suitable itinerary for it in the United States. It would also
                        be of interest to know whether you would be prepared to make a similar trip
                        to the Soviet Union at some future time. Members of our staffs have, of
                        course, cooperated closely in the handling of various agricultural exchanges

                    <p>During a conversation on August 8, 1962, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> reminded Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that the question of creation of a
                        Deputy Foreign Ministers forum to discuss matters relating to Germany and
                        Berlin had been raised with Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> as early as the previous spring.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked if <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had received instructions for a

                        would raise the matter with Moscow. On August 13 he met again with Rusk to

                    <p>The Special Group charged with responsibility for Operation Mongoose (see
                            <ref target="#d200">Document 200</ref>) met on August 10, 1962.
                        According to a chronology of Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>'s positions concerning Cuba,
                        prepared for him 2# months later, <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> maintained at the meeting that “the Soviets will not
                        let Cuba fail” and that, to prevent such a failure, they would supplement
                        conventional military aid with medium-range ballistic missiles. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> confirmed that aspect of the
                        discussion in a memorandum for the record he prepared on October 31. For

                    <p>The National Board of Estimates reviewed “The Soviet Stake in Cuba” in a
                        memorandum of August 15, stating: “Cuba could be used by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as a military base from which to threaten
                        the US. With the growth of Soviet strategic capabilities, however,
                        installations on Cuba would add little to the weight of attack which the
                        Soviets could direct against the US. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s chief motive for the establishment of, for example, a
                        medium-range missile base on Cuba would therefore be to deter an anticipated
                        US military intervention against Castro. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> almost certainly recognizes, however, that such an
                        undertaking would be as likely to provoke as to deter American
                        intervention.” The memorandum continued: “Most important of all, by such an
                        act the Soviets would firmly commit themselves to the military protection of
                        Cuba, a step which they have thus far refrained from taking and which, we
                        believe, they will continue to avoid.” For text, see ibid., pages

                            Whitman Bassow, a <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> correspondent in
                            Moscow, had been expelled from the Soviet Union, an expulsion which was
                            both unexplainable and unexpected. (Telegram 394 from Moscow; ibid.,
                            961.6211/8-1662) In telegram 407, August 18, the Embassy reported that
                            the expulsion appeared to be based on a cable Bassow had attempted to
                            send in connection with the story “What Makes Ivan Laugh?,” which
                            appeared in the August 13 issue of <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi>. The
                            telegram concluded with the suggestion that, in view of the U.S.
                            interest in increasing the flow of information from the Soviet Union,
                            the Embassy should be authorized to approach the Foreign Ministry at an
                            appropriate level to ask for an explanation of the expulsion. (Ibid.,
                            961.6211/8-1862)</note> Washington <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi>
                        Bureau feels Bassow expulsion based on at least two other 1962 issues in
                        addition to August 13 jokes. These are Hulda Clark story January 8 and
                        material February 5 issue. Also Department understands that interview with
                        school principal may have been maneuvered despite prior refusal and
                        objections by principal.</p>
                    <p>Department has advised <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> this issue best played
                        low key in order not jeopardize possibility replacement. Department not
                        considering retaliation at this time. <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> has
                        indicated both to Department and White House that they also do not wish
                        Department to retaliate for same reasons. <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi>
                        London correspondent Erwin Goodwin now has valid Soviet visa which issued
                        him as summer replacement for Bassow. <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi>
                        intends apparently send Goodwin soonest to Moscow in order maintain Bureau

                    <p>Embassy may at its discretion approach Foreign Ministry on informal basis to
                        request explanation for expulsion. Matter already discussed informally with
                        Soviet Embassy here. As for legality of telegraph office failure notify
                        sender his message not acceptable, Department feels this question not too
                        meaningful since Soviet practices cannot be equated with those followed
                        Western countries.</p>

                    <p>On August 14, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        asked me for lunch at the Soviet Embassy. Following are the high points of
                        an entirely non-memorable conversation.</p>
                    <p>1. The Ambassador's chief interest was evidently in American domestic
                        politics. He asked me a number of questions about the prospects of the
                        autumn elections, the strength of conservatism in the Congress, the power of
                        the John Birch Society, etc. In answer I tried to remind him of the ebb and
                        flow of American politics. I told him that phenomena like the John Birch
                        Society were a predictable response to affirmative and purposeful government
                        and said that anyone in the United States in the thirties who had permitted
                        himself to become obsessed with the evidences of surface opposition to
                        Roosevelt would have deceived himself about the main trend of events—that
                        observers must take care not to spend all their time watching the sideshows
                        while the parade marches by outside. He seemed unmoved.</p>
                    <p>2. We had some talk about the United Nations. He said that he had no
                        information regarding the rumor that Chairman <hi rend="italic">Khrushchev</hi> might be coming to New York in September and gave the
                        impression of slight skepticism about it. He said little about Berlin. When
                        I asked him when <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> was likely
                        to return to East Germany, he said that he thought <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> was taking a much-needed holiday in
                        Sochi.</p>
                    <p>3. He raised the question of the Congo and asked why we let Tshombe get away
                        with his divisive and obstructionist policies. He seemed to believe that, if
                        we really wanted to, we could discipline Tshombe and integrate Katanga
                        tomorrow. I tried to explain that ordering small potentates around might
                        sometimes be harder than it looked and instanced Enver Hoxha.<note n="2" xml:id="d223fn2">Chairman of the Albanian Communist Party.</note> I also
                        said that, while the society with which he was most familiar could no doubt
                        pursue any policy it wanted so far as domestic reaction was concerned,
                        societies which believed in free discussion had to take some account of
                        internal opinion, and that this might affect, for example, the policy of
                        Great Britain. The exchange was inconclusive.</p>
                    <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0504"/>
                    <p>4. I then asked him why, if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was so
                        strong and secure, it did not have enough confidence in itself to permit the
                        sale in Moscow kiosks and hotels of western non-Communist newspapers and
                        magazines. He said that it was necessary to forbid the sale of such western
                        publications in Moscow because, if Soviet citizens knew what lies these
                        publications contained, they would be filled with indignation and fury
                        toward the west, and this would make it much harder for the Soviet
                        Government to pursue its policy of peace. He then launched into the question
                        of Soviet anti-semitism. If the Russian people read the stories in the
                        American press about anti-semitism in the Soviet Union, he said, then they
                        would really get mad and the Jews in the Soviet Union would be in genuine
                        danger. When I lightly questioned this line of argument and said that I
                        doubted whether the sale of the London Times or the Manchester Guardian or
                        the New York Times in Moscow could have such a catastrophic impact,
                        especially if the Soviet people were as dedicated to their regime as their
                        leaders insisted, he said that, as a matter of fact, in 1959-60 the Soviet
                        Government had decided to make some adjustments on the import of foreign
                        newspapers and magazines. Then the <gloss target="#t_U21">U-2</gloss>
                        incident took place. The consequence, the Ambassador said, was to set back
                        for many years the prospect of permitting the sale of foreign publications
                        in the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>5. The Ambassador reminisced at considerable length about himself and his
                        entry into the Soviet foreign service. He said that 70 percent of Soviet
                        Ambassadors were, like himself, engineers; and that, so far as he knew, only
                        one Soviet Ambassador was a lawyer. In chatting about Soviet diplomats, he
                        said that the present Soviet Ambassador to Brazil speaks neither Spanish nor
                        Portuguese and is rather unhappy.</p>

                    <p>At a meeting in Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s office on August 21, 1962, Director of Central
                        Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> reported new
                        information available on the accelerated Soviet supply of personnel and
                        materiel to Cuba. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> indicated
                        that the extent of Soviet supply operations was much greater than had been
                        reported 11 days earlier and that construction work probably included either
                        highly sophisticated electronic installations or missile sites, probably
                        ground-to-air. According to <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>'s
                        memorandum of the meeting: “There was general agreement that the situation
                        was critical and that the most dynamic action was indicated. There was
                        discussion of various courses of action open to us in case the Soviets place
                        MRBM missiles on Cuban territory. There was also discussion of blockades of
                        Soviet and Bloc shipping into Cuba or alternatively a total blockade of
                        Cuba. Throughout these discussions, it was abundantly clear that in the
                        minds of State, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName>,
                        speaking for the White House, there is a very definite inter-relationship
                        between Cuba and other trouble spots, such as Berlin. It was felt that a
                        blockade of Cuba would automatically bring about a blockade of Berlin.” For

                    <p>The next day President's Special Assistant Schlesinger forwarded to <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> an intelligence memorandum
                        on Soviet military aid to Cuba that concluded that recent military shipments
                        and construction activity, together with recent Soviet bloc economic
                        commitments, amounted “to the most extensive campaign to bolster a non-bloc
                        country ever undertaken by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.” In
                        his covering memorandum, however, Schlesinger stated that “any military
                        construction will probably be defensive in function; a launching pad
                        directed against the U.S. would be too blatant a provocation.” For text, see

                    <p>At a meeting on Cuba with his advisers on August 23, the President raised the
                        question, according to <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>'s
                        memorandum of the meeting, of “what we could do against Soviet missile sites
                        in Cuba. Could we take them out by air or would a ground offensive be
                        necessary or alternatively could they be destroyed by a substantial
                        guerrilla effort.” The President also “raised question of what we should do
                        in Cuba if Soviets precipitated a Berlin crisis.” After the meeting
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> told Attorney General
                            <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert Kennedy</persName> privately that
                        “Cuba was the key to all of Latin America; if Cuba succeeds, we can expect
                        most of Latin America to fall.” In National Security Action Memorandum No.
                        181, issued later the same day, the President specified eight actions or
                        studies to be “undertaken in the light of evidence of new bloc activity in
                        Cuba.” For text of <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>'s

                    <p>In April 1962 the United States had informed the North Atlantic Treaty
                        Organization's North Atlantic Council that it would be willing, if the
                        alliance's European members wished, to “join its allies in developing a

                        <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> force on the Alliance, in view of
                        already programmed US strategic forces, but we are prepared to proceed with
                        it in view of the recognized need for greater sharing of nuclear
                        responsibilities within the Alliance and the fact that such force would have
                        military utility.” For text of the Department of State's instructions to the

                    <p>While in Geneva for the disarmament conference and the signing of the Laos

                        discussed nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> apparently raised objection to a
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> multilateral nuclear force as an
                        obstacle to any agreement on nonproliferation. See ibid., <ref target="frus1961-63v07#pg_494">volume VII, page

                    <p>On August 8 <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> called in Soviet
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and, according to
                        the memorandum of conversation, asked that he convey a “personal message” to
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on “non-diffusion” of
                        nuclear weapons: “Your Government apparently wishes to consider multilateral
                        arrangements with respect to nuclear weapons as a part of the central
                        problem of the multiplication of national nuclear forces. I sincerely
                        believe that this point of view rests upon a misunderstanding and that it
                        stands in the way of our acting together on a common interest. From our
                        point of view, we consider the discussion of multilateral arrangements in
                        the West as, among other things, a means for preventing the further spread
                        of nuclear weapons on a national basis.” <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated further that he “had the impression from our
                        conversation in Geneva that it might be possible for us to concentrate on
                        the single issue of national nuclear capability.” Were it “clear on both
                        sides that this is the object and that we are not now trying to deal with
                        the issue of possible multilateral arrangements, it seems to me that we
                        might be able to reach an agreement with respect to the non-transfer of
                        weapons, either directly or indirectly, to additional national forces.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, commenting on “the
                        point in the Secretary's message concerning multilateral arrangements,” said
                        “he thought this was all right—it is not part of the central problem. He
                        asked about Germany, however. The Soviets had three points, not to give
                        Germany <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0507"/>atomic weapons directly,
                        indirectly, or through multilateral arrangements.” For text, see ibid.,
                        pages 541-547.</p>
                    <p>On August 23 <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> brought in
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s reply to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>. According to the memorandum of
                        conversation, “the message from the Foreign Minister noted that the U.S. and
                        U.S.S.R. positions now appear to be quite close as regards the non-transfer
                        problem. It is proposed that an international undertaking be sought
                        involving three points: (1) an obligation on the part of the nuclear powers
                        not to hand over to non-nuclear states nuclear weapons or the technical
                        information necessary for their production; (2) an obligation on the part of
                        non-nuclear states not to produce and not to acquire from other states
                        nuclear weapons, and also not to receive technical information necessary for
                        their production; (3) there should also be excluded the transfer through
                        military alliances to those states which do not possess them i.e., the
                        transfer of such weapons in an indirect manner, irrespective of whether or
                        not the national armed forces of these states are component parts of the
                        armed forces of any military alliance.” <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> commented that, “as he understood the presentation, the
                        position outlined by Foreign Minister Gromyko would appear to be a
                        constructive and positive step forward.” Rusk continued, “we cannot define
                        now the hypothetical formula [for the multilateral nuclear force] upon which
                        the alliance on our side may agree; however, it should be clear that we
                        would not use an alliance arrangement for the purpose of passing nuclear
                        weapons indirectly to a non-nuclear power.” For text, see ibid., pages

                    <p>Moscow's abolition of the office of the Soviet commandant in Berlin on 22
                        August was intended to remove the most important remaining symbol of
                        four-power responsibility for all of the city. The timing of this move
                        probably was dictated by renewed Western insistence that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> acknowledge its responsibility for East
                        Berlin by participating in a <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0508"/>meeting of the four commandants to discuss means of easing tensions
                        produced by the recent incidents at the Berlin Wall. Although the decision
                        to dissolve the commandant's office probably does not foreshadow an early
                        breakoff of bilateral talks with the US, it does suggest that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> sees little chance of obtaining
                        further Western concessions at this time and that he is now mainly concerned
                        with strengthening the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s position for
                        signing a separate peace treaty with East Germany.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet communiqué<note n="2" xml:id="d226fn2">For text of the statement
                            issued by the Soviet news agency TASS announcing abolition of the post
                            of Soviet commandant in Berlin, August 22, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany,1944-1985</hi>, pp. 823-824.</note> announcing
                        the abolition of the commandant's office suggests that this will not have
                        any immediate practical effect on Allied military access to West Berlin.
                        Responsibility for “control over the movement of personnel and supplies” of
                        the Western garrisons has been transferred “temporarily” to the commander in
                        chief of the Soviet forces in Germany. The Soviets apparently do not intend
                        to withdraw from the Berlin Air Safety Center (<gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss>) in the near future, and thus abandon their control over
                        military air access. The failure of the communiqué to refer specifically to
                            <gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss>'s future suggests, however, that
                        some move to subject civilian air access to East German control may be in
                        the offing. Moscow may also be prepared to permit the Ulbricht regime to
                        incorporate East Berlin into East Germany and to impose new requirements on
                        Allied military personnel entering East Berlin in an effort to force the
                        West either to recognize <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sovereignty
                        over East Berlin or to forego further patrol activity there.</p>
                    <p>The dissolution of the commandant's office marked the culmination of a series
                        of maneuvers over the past months to bypass the Western commandants in
                        Berlin and to transfer all remaining four-power relations and functions from
                        the commandants to the level of the commanders of the Soviet and Western
                        forces in Germany. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had rejected a
                        Western proposal of 25 June for a meeting of the four commandants to discuss
                        means of easing tensions in Berlin. The acting Soviet commandant repeated
                        this rejection when the three Western commandants renewed the proposal on 19
                        August. The Soviet communiqué of 22 August charged that the Western
                        commandants were trying to take advantage of the existence of the Soviet
                        commandant's office to interfere in the internal affairs of the “sovereign
                        and independent” <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and its capital.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the immediate purpose of blocking Western efforts to oblige
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to acknowledge its responsibility
                        for East Berlin, the Soviets probably believe that the abolition of their
                        commandant's office will further erode Western rights based on the
                        four-power status of the city and make it more difficult for the West to
                        justify its position that the continued presence of Western forces under
                        existing agreements is not a negotiable question.</p>

                    <p>The decision to terminate the commandant's office has not been accompanied
                        thus far by any efforts to create an atmosphere of imminent crisis. The East
                        German reaction to recent disorders in West Berlin was harsh, featuring
                        charges that “fascist hooligans” and “young political rowdies,” enjoying the
                        protection of Mayor Brandt, had attacked Soviet personnel and terrorized the
                        West Berlin populace. Moscow radio warned on 20 August that tension in
                        Berlin “has now turned into a direct threat of a serious conflict” but
                        concluded that these disorders simply show that a peace treaty must be
                        signed without delay. Moscow added that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> “is not closing the door to negotiations on the German and
                        Berlin problems.”</p>

                        of any <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> troops in West Berlin, the
                        Soviets continued to hint privately at flexibility on this issue. A member
                        of the Soviet <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> delegation sounded out a US
                        official on 17 August regarding a “<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        solution” which would permit US, British, and French forces to remain in
                        West Berlin, supplemented by contingents of Warsaw Pact and other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> troops, all under the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> flag. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> also mentioned this formula in his 13 August talk
                        with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet ambassador to Bonn took a cautious line after returning from
                        Moscow, stating on 18 August that there is “no definite date” for signing a
                        separate treaty and that Moscow expects further talks between <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. [<hi rend="italic">13 lines of 2-column source

                        create an occasion for a meeting with President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        reportedly told the West German ambassador on 18 August that he probably
                        would arrive in the second half of September, although his plans were not
                        yet definite. President Kekkonen of Finland told [<hi rend="italic">1 line
                            of 2-column source text not declassified</hi>] that his visit to the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has been scheduled from 10 to 17
                        October, after <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s visit to
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s principal purpose in
                        appearing before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> probably would be to
                        generate additional pressure on the West to be more forthcoming in
                        negotiations for a Berlin settlement. He might envisage this as his final
                        effort to probe for Western concessions before deciding to proceed with a
                        separate peace treaty. Recent Soviet pronouncements suggest that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will propose a “compromise”
                        under which the Western “occupation regime” would be replaced by some form
                        of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role in guaranteeing the independence
                        and security of West Berlin. He may also call for the admission of both
                        German states to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and seek <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> endorsement of the need for a German peace
                        treaty, portraying this as the prerequisite for progress on disarmament and
                        a general improvement in East-West relations.</p>
                    <p>The possibility cannot be excluded, however, that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has decided to proceed toward a separate peace
                        treaty or invoke other measures to heighten Berlin tensions and believes
                        that taking the issue to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would inhibit
                        Western reactions.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Geneva Talks</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The USSR rejected on 20 August proposals for a nuclear test ban treaty which
                        would include tests in the atmosphere, outer space, and under water, but not
                        underground explosions. A Soviet spokesman at Geneva said a partial test ban
                        “will not settle the problem” of ending the nuclear armaments race “because
                        the Americans would continue testing weapons underground.” He added that the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> remains “dedicated” to the eight
                        neutralist members' “compromise” memorandum as the “sole” basis for a treaty
                        banning all tests.</p>
                    <p>In a talk with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAH1">Dean</persName> on 15
                        August, Soviet delegate <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName>
                        made it clear that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will not relax
                        its insistence on a test ban based exclusively on national detection
                        systems, with no international supervision or obligatory on-site
                        inspections. He contended that on-site inspection is an entirely political
                        question and that the divergent views of Soviet and US scientists are
                        irrelevant. <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> hinted,
                        however, that prospects for agreement may improve in the next few years with
                        changed circumstances, including perfection of detection systems which might
                        make the US more willing to forego on-site inspection.</p>

                    <p>On August 27, 1962, the President and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> issued a joint statement
                        announcing submission to the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Conference of “a
                        draft treaty containing proposals for an end to all nuclear testing in all
                        environments as well as an alternative draft treaty providing for an end to
                        nuclear testing in the atmosphere, underwater, and in outer space.” For text

                    <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> responded to the
                        President in an informal communication on September 4: “Let us immediately
                        sign an agreement on the cessation of nuclear tests in the atmosphere, outer
                        space and under water but at the same time let us agree that with regard to
                        underground tests negotiations will go on with an aim to reach an agreement
                        on the underground tests as well.” <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> added: “We proceeded earlier and proceed now from
                        an assumption that under any international agreement on the cessation of
                        nuclear weapons tests France should assume commitments analogous to those of

                    <p>At the Secretary's Planning Meeting on August 28, 1962, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> presented thoughts he had developed
                        regarding where the Soviets currently stand in their prosecution of the cold
                        war. He explained that in the planning process it is desirable on occasion
                        to apply the long view, to look at an existing situation against the
                        backdrop of what has gone before and of alternatives that seem open for the
                        future.</p>
                    <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0512"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> saw the post-war Soviet
                        offensive as falling into two distinct phases. The first—Stalin's—had been
                        marked by a direct thrust riding on the momentum of the war. In the West it
                        involved the reannexation of the Baltic States and Bessarabia, subjugation
                        of the countries of Eastern Europe, the military threat against Iran and
                        Turkey, the guerrilla campaign in Greece, attempted exploitation of
                        communist strength in the countries of Western Europe, and various moves,
                        including the Berlin Blockade, to achieve Soviet dominance within the whole
                        of Germany. This drive in the West was brought to a halt by the success of
                        the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, and finally the Berlin airlift. In
                        the East, Stalin capitalized on the communist victory in China, encouraged
                        dangerous guerrilla campaigns in South Korea, Malaya, Indo-China and the
                        Philippines, and finally fostered a direct military attack on South Korea.
                        The thrust in the East was brought to a halt by the decisive defeat of the
                        Chinese Communist armies at the 38th parallel in Korea in April-June, 1951,
                        although guerrilla operations continued in Indo-China.</p>
                    <p>During Stalin's last years an interlude occurred in Soviet active prosecution
                        of the cold war. This continued after Stalin's death, his successors seeming
                        uncertain as to how, or perhaps whether, to proceed. Only after <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> firmly established himself in
                        power in 1957 was a systematic new offensive launched.</p>
                    <p>Inauguration of this second offensive coincided with the tremendous
                        psychological boost given the Soviets by Sputnik I and the presumably
                        parallel advances in military rocketry. Looking back at it, this offensive
                        appears definitely as a “Post-Sputnik Offensive.” The starkest manifestation
                        of the new drive was <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        commitment to do something about Berlin. Elsewhere its main thrust was
                        directed toward the underdeveloped countries and included renewed guerrilla
                        warfare in Laos and South Viet-Nam, attempted exploitation of turbulence and
                        confusion in the Congo, efforts to capitalize on the windfall victory in
                        Cuba, and serious—and costly—engagement of the United States in the trade
                        and aid field. The Soviets gave every evidence of being genuinely confident
                        over their prospects in this offensive. They seemed really to believe that
                        they were riding an irresistible wave of history.</p>
                    <p>Today this second offensive is in disarray. Efforts in the Congo have been
                        checkmated; Berlin had yielded no easy dividends; Cuba has proved less of a
                        springboard than a trough draining Soviet resources. Meanwhile, and
                        completely contrary to doctrinal concepts, the economic progress and growing
                        unity of Western Europe have reached a stage where they can no longer be
                        written off as artificial developments dependent on the US. Within the
                        communist world itself a strong backwash of the wave of history has set in.
                        The Chinese Communists have failed dismally in their program to transform
                        China. The ChiCom revolt <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0513"/>against
                        Moscow's authority has rent the monolithic character of the socialist camp
                        and has diluted Soviet control of the world communist movement as a whole.
                        The Soviet Union and the European satellites show unmistakable signs of
                        resources strains. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has had
                        to preside over the liquidation or indefinite postponement of internal goals
                        to which he was personally strongly committed. Worldwide, the communist
                        image stands tarnished and few appear overly impressed by the
                        irresistibleness of the communist cause.</p>
                    <p>Viewed in the perspective furnished by the foregoing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> said, the present situation leads to
                        two general conclusions:</p>
                    <p>First, we have reason for real hope. Assuming continued alertness and
                        required performance on our part, we have it in our grasp to frustrate
                        Soviet aims in regard to world communism and perhaps to achieve a set of
                        inter-state relationships that will conform more nearly to our long term
                        security interests.</p>
                    <p>Second, before things get better they may get worse. We must view the present
                        and immediate future as a time of special danger. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may seek to break out of his
                        frustrations. Three areas appear to merit special watchfulness:</p>
                    <p>—The arms race: <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may stake
                        heavily on an important breakthrough that would furnish a hard military base
                        for a renewed offensive.</p>
                    <p>—Berlin: <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may feel under
                        strong compulsion to achieve at least one success to which he can point, and
                        may be prepared to step up the risk rate over Berlin.</p>
                    <p>—Cuba: <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may be unwilling to
                        accept as final the failure of Cuba to produce automatic gains in Latin
                        America and may decide to increase substantially Soviet outlays and risks to
                        secure a payoff from Cuba.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> called attention to an
                        exchange of memoranda between <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>

                        despite certain divergencies both papers underscored an evident trend on
                        Moscow's part to reduce commitments to world communism in favor of Russian
                        state interests. This trend, if it should continue, would be of central
                        importance. We should watch it with care.</p>
                    <p>There appeared to be general agreement within the group that the Soviets may
                        have to undertake reappraisal of their policies. It was noted that when
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> started his special
                        drive, he committed himself to “peaceful coexistence” as the best means of
                        getting on with world revolution. <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0514"/>If he is dissatisfied with the results, as the morning's presentation
                        would indicate, he faces the necessity of choosing between hard
                        alternatives. He may have to decide whether to elevate doctrine to “pure
                        doctrine” and concentrate on Soviet interests as state interests, or to
                        thrust forward again with stops out.</p>
                    <p>Several aspects of current Soviet conduct were seen as suggestive in this
                        connection. Why is Moscow restraining Red China in Southeast Asia? On the
                        basis of an objective appraisal, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might well conclude that the communists could
                        afford to take greater risks there and reap worthwhile dividends. It might
                        be, of course, that irrespective of surface appearances he does not feel
                        sure of the US, of what the US would actually do in a pinch, and hence sees
                        less opportunity than one might suppose. But other factors—factors related
                        to Soviet state interests—could be at play.</p>
                    <p>The latest Soviet position on the nuclear diffusion problem was also thought
                        to be of significance. For the first time, the Soviets had moved away from
                        concentration on Germany. They proposed a simple one-two approach that would
                        affect all nations equally: We agree with each other not to share nuclear
                        weapons with anybody; then we agree to try to persuade others not to receive
                        or to make nuclear weapons. This is very interesting from the standpoint of
                        Soviet relations with China. Are the Soviets prepared to take on China on
                        this issue? It may be that they are attempting a gimmick, that they
                        calculate that after Peiping refuses to be bound they can induce the US to
                        go ahead and force West German agreement. On the other hand, they may be
                        reflecting old-fashioned state interests. They have a nuclear capability and
                        we have a nuclear capability. Perhaps they have decided that it is to their
                        national interest that no one else have it and are prepared to act
                        accordingly.</p>
                    <p>Several in the group thought the Soviets because of strictly state interests
                        are indeed concerned to forestall an independent ChiCom nuclear capability.
                        An agreement with us would make it easier for Moscow to refuse any aid to
                        China in the nuclear weapons field. Moscow might have in mind forcing a
                        multilateral military arrangement on China, under which the Soviets would
                        actually retain all nuclear capability in their own hands. The reason that
                        Moscow has chosen this particular time to move may be that, contrary to our
                        own current estimates, they see the Chinese as close to detonating a device.
                        They may feel under some urgency to head off the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>Others doubted that Moscow could realistically hope that China can be headed
                        off by any Soviet maneuver. Almost certainly Peiping poses to Moscow a de
                        Gaulle problem magnified many times. Moreover, the Chinese Communists have
                        already shown that they have no intention of permitting Soviet-controlled
                        forces on their territory. It is also questionable <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0515"/>that Moscow needs an excuse to refuse aid
                        to China's nuclear development program. They evidently have been refusing
                        such aid all along.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the question of Soviet restraints on China in Southeast Asia,
                        it was suggested that Moscow is concerned that Peiping not be given an
                        opportunity to control Soviet foreign policy. The Soviets have a publicized
                        commitment to back China in difficulties involving the US. They almost
                        certainly at this stage do not wish to get into a situation that would
                        require them to honor those commitments. However, their prestige is involved
                        in the commitments and they doubtless wish to avoid the necessity of openly
                        reneging on them. Hence the best policy is to keep China quiet. Also, Moscow
                        hardly has great interest in any aggrandizement of Chinese power and
                        influence in Southeast Asia or anywhere else at this time. After all, two
                        cold wars are currently under way.</p>
                    <p>Reverting to the overall situation existing at present, the point was made
                        that the altered Soviet outlook underscored the desirability of a US policy
                        that concentrates on getting on with our own job. The best way to deal with
                        the communists is to take initiatives related to putting the free world's
                        own house in order. The problem for us is to determine and to make the most
                        of initiatives that are open to us. Important possibilities already exist in
                        connection with the development of the European and Atlantic community, the
                        Alliance for Progress, and augmenting western influence in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. We should search for other areas, ones
                        wherein it will not be necessary to secure Soviet agreement.</p>
                    <p>An exercise that might be instructive and helpful would be to run over the
                        postwar period and to make a check list of critical decisions that were or
                        were not made that had a bearing on our capability for initiatives, for our
                        capability to keep control over events. Certain decisions that had had a
                        significant negative effect readily came to mind:</p>
                    <p>—The decision to demobilize after the war. This served to tie our hands at a
                        critical time. For example it forced the decision not to take action in
                        China in 1946-47. Six or seven US divisions in China might have made the
                        difference, but we simply did not have the divisions.</p>
                    <p>—The withdrawal of the last US combat unit from Korea in 1949. This may have
                        been the decisive step that triggered the Soviet decision for the invasion
                        of South Korea.</p>
                    <p>—The failure to take direct action in North Viet-Nam in 1952. The Red River
                        Valley had been long looked upon as the key to all Indo-China and even
                        Southeast Asia. Yet we failed to take the military steps necessary to tip
                        the scales.</p>
                    <p>There are others of similar import—other instances of critically important
                        negative decisions, positive decisions, and decisions by failure to take
                        decision. It would be fruitful, it was thought, to review these.</p>
                    <p>As a caveat in regard to initiatives, the suggestion was made that we
                        concentrate on operations that do not require acceptance of our own ideas,
                        institutions, and practices by others. The Soviet failures that had <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0516"/>been noted in the morning's
                        discussion related in almost every instance to efforts on the part of Moscow
                        to impose something alien on one or another people. Castro's influence in
                        Latin America had waned, for example, because he represented an alien force.
                        The Latin Americans do not want to be dominated by anybody but
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>A specific initiative proposed was that we see the contest in South Viet-Nam
                        through to a fully successful conclusion. The stakes involved in South
                        Viet-Nam are much larger than South Viet-Nam itself. At issue there is
                        whether communist sponsored insurgency in the guise of a war of liberation
                        can pay off. This is a matter of great doctrinal importance to the
                        communists and one that looms large in the Sino-Soviet dispute. If we can
                        thoroughly disabuse those who see indirect aggression as a plausible way, we
                        will have scored heavily.</p>
                    <p>Achievement of a more rapid US rate of growth was viewed as another area
                        where we have a real job to do. The relative lag of the past several years
                        must have encouraged the communists. It doubtless contributed to the
                        optimism that underlay the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        offensive. In the present situation it is doubly important that we push
                        forward.</p>
                    <p>The Kremlin was seen as also probably searching for “new initiatives”. This
                        would be particularly true if they read the balance sheet as it is being
                        read here. For this reason, it would perhaps be better for us if Moscow
                        remained more optimistic than we feel they should be.</p>
                    <p>What we should hope for, it was suggested, is that the Soviets will seek
                        compensation in activities and accomplishments related to the enhancement of
                        Russian national prestige. It would be to our interest if they had a golden
                        bridge to a retreat along this particular road. With this in mind, such
                        successes as the recent spectacular in space might in the long run not be
                        too bad.</p>
                    <p>We should give thought to moves on our part that might contribute to a
                        rechanneling of Soviet energies and ambitions into national pride and
                        prestige areas. We need, perhaps, a “Department of Weird Ideas” that would
                        have as its task uninhibitedly exploring the whole range of possibilities
                        lying before us. Challenges in the battle against nature might lend
                        themselves to this. As an example, we might seize upon general concern over
                        bacteriological warfare, and propose to the Russians a two-fold attack: one,
                        a declaration against the use of bacteriological weapons; and two, a pooling
                        of our respective knowledge of esoteric bacteria and germs to advance world
                        capability in the health field. Some years back when a new strain of the
                        black plague virus was brought into India by birds from the Soviet Union and
                        was producing alarming results, the Russians cooperated with the Indians and
                        with us to lick the problem. They did this quietly and without attempting to
                        make propaganda gains. A number of means may be open to us to encourage and
                        capitalize on a “Russian spirit”, as against a “Communist spirit”.</p>
                    <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0517"/>
                    <p>In this connection, it was noted that we should keep in mind that there will
                        be, before too long, a post-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> period in the Soviet Union. The climate then may
                        be quite different. We should lay as extensive a foundation as possible for
                        utilizing any opportunities that may then arise.</p>
                    <p>It was generally agreed that it is indeed important that we give thought to
                        the “post-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>” problem. We
                        should also look at post-situations around the world, wherever there is a
                        dominant figure in control and particularly where means for an orderly
                        succession are lacking.</p>

                    <p>On July 23, 1962, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> signed for the United States the Declaration on the
                        Neutrality of Laos agreed upon at the International Conference on the
                        Settlement of the Laotian Question in Geneva. Attached to the Declaration
                        was a 20-article Protocol. The texts of the Declaration and Protocol are
                        printed in <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,
                            1962</hi>, pages 1075-1083.</p>
                    <p>In a memorandum to Assistant Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>, August 28, Roger Hilsman, Director of the Bureau
                        of Intelligence and Research, argued that the tactics being followed by
                        Pathet Lao/Viet Minh forces were nevertheless “consistent with an intention
                        to prevent the formation <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0518"/>of a true
                        government of national union in effective control of all Laos.” Hilsman
                        continued, “the evidence so far available does not indicate that the
                        Communists and in particular Moscow are ready to abandon the entire
                        coalition principle. The pattern of past Communist negotiations at
                        Panmunjom, Warsaw, Berlin, and elsewhere is to confront the West with
                        prolonged intransigence and obstructionism in the hope of eroding resistance
                        and winning cheap gains without provoking an unacceptable military response.
                        When convinced that such a response may be in the offing or that public
                        rupture of an agreement carries intolerable political costs, the Communists
                        usually compromise their position so as to avoid either consequence.” The

                    <p>Photographs obtained from a <gloss target="#t_U21">U-2</gloss> reconnaissance
                        mission flown over Cuba on August 29, 1962, revealed that surface-to-air
                        missile sites were under construction on the island. Deputy Director of
                        Central Intelligence Marshall Carter conveyed the information on August 31
                        to <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> at the White House.

                    <p>In a memorandum to the President, August 31, <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> stated that “we have two problems here which should be
                        kept separate. The first is our reaction to the current step, and the second
                        is our preparations to react against something which would require or make
                        possible a major military operation against Cuba. The present actions in
                        Cuba do not justify such action.” Accompanying the memorandum was <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName>'s analysis of the probable impact of
                        the introduction of Soviet missiles into Cuba. He argued that surface-to-air
                        missiles would “substantially increase Communist defensive capabilities
                        there” but would not “carry any increased direct threat to the safety of the
                        U.S. mainland.” Surface-to-surface missiles with nuclear warheads, on the
                        other hand, “would constitute a very significant military threat to the
                        continental U.S.,” and “it appears probable that on military grounds alone,
                        the establishment of such a capability would be unacceptable.” For text, see

                    <p>In a memorandum to Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, September 1, Director of the Bureau of Intelligence
                        and Research Hilsman concluded, among <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0519"/>other things, that “current Soviet moves in Cuba do not
                        appear to be synchronized with Soviet moves in Berlin, but they have a
                        common root in Moscow's growing sense of power, and Moscow may hope that
                        increased tensions in one area will lead to Western concessions in the
                        other.” In a memorandum to the President, September 3, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>, Counselor of the Department of
                        State, called the Soviet military deliveries “a testing thrust by Moscow”
                        which “places before us the question of where and how we should draw the
                        line with respect to unacceptable action and behavior by the Communists in
                        Cuba and the Hemisphere.” For texts of both memoranda, see ibid., pages
                        1014-1022 and 1025-1032.</p>
                    <p>On September 4 the White House released a statement by President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> in which he noted the presence of
                        antiaircraft defensive missiles in Cuba. Kennedy added, however, that there
                        was no evidence of organized Soviet combat forces in Cuba, nor of military
                        bases provided to the Soviet Union, nor of the presence of weapons with an
                        offensive capability, such as ground-to-ground missiles. “Were it to be
                        otherwise, the gravest issues would arise.” For text, see Department of

                    <p>On September 6, 1962, the President's Special Counsel, <persName corresp="#p_STC1">Theodore Sorensen</persName>, met with Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> at the latter's request.
                        The Soviet Ambassador informed Sorensen that, as a result of their previous
                        meeting on August 23, which he had reported to Moscow, he had received a
                        personal message from Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> directing him to inform Sorensen that he would
                        not attend the opening of the United Nations General Assembly and that
                        “nothing will be undertaken before the American Congressional elections that
                        could complicate the international situation or aggravate the tension in the
                        relations between our two countries. We shall follow this course, provided
                        there are no actions taken on the other side which would change the
                        situation. This includes a German peace settlement and West Berlin.” For

                    <p>There are four points on which the President wishes to give Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> personal guidance for his
                        use in his first conversation with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>:</p>
                    <p>(1) With respect to the recent exchange of notes on the possible inadvertent
                        violation of Soviet frontiers by a U.S. patrol plane,<note n="2" xml:id="d233fn2">See footnote <ref target="#d236fn2">2, Document
                                236</ref>.</note> the President has particularly asked Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> to reiterate that his
                        instructions of January 1961 are firm and will be most strictly enforced.
                        Continuing investigation indicates that safeguarding procedures in the case
                        of this particular patrol flight were not adequate, and corrective measures
                        are being taken.</p>
                    <p>(2) The President would like to make clear to Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that he has given personal
                        examination to the question of possible interference <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0521"/>by United States aircraft and ships with
                        the freedom of movement and navigation of Soviet vessels in international
                        waters. On hearing of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>'s report of the Chairman's expression,<note n="3" xml:id="d233fn3">See footnote <ref target="#d215fn2">2, Document
                                215</ref>.</note> the President instituted immediate inquiries, and
                        as a result he can give definite assurance that there have not been any
                        encounters since the President's inauguration which have had as their
                        motivation the hindrance of movement or navigation in international waters
                        of Soviet vessels. In particular, we know of no instance in which any Soviet
                        ship was ordered to stop or be fired on by a U.S. naval vessel. It is always
                        possible that a particular military officer may act with imperfect judgment,
                        but instructions to all such officers are clear and have been reiterated. If
                        the Chairman knows of specific instances which raise specific questions, the
                        President will be glad to have them investigated if pertinent data are
                        presented.</p>
                    <p>(3) If Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> should
                        again raise the question of any possible relationship between events in
                        Berlin and political divisions in the United States, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> should inform the Chairman that the
                        answer which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> made at
                        the time represents the official opinion of this Government. Any crisis
                        precipitated by Soviet action over Berlin, at any time, would unite public
                        opinion in the United States. The result of such a crisis would inevitably
                        be a worsening of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States,
                        which would not be in the interest of either country. On the other hand, a
                        settlement of this problem and the achievement of a modus vivendi which
                        would reduce tension in Berlin would be to the interest of both
                        governments.</p>
                    <p>(4) The President continues to regard an effective nuclear test ban as a
                        matter of the greatest importance, and would like Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> to emphasize these two basic points:
                        first, there is simply no way in which the President can bring the United
                        States Senate to agreement on a comprehensive treaty without inspection;
                        second, as the President sees it, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. have three great
                        common interests in a workable agreement:</p>
                    <p>(a) the fallout problem</p>
                    <p>(b) the hazard of high energy electrons contaminating outer space</p>
                    <p>(c) and, perhaps most important of all, the common interest in discouraging
                        other powers from acquiring nuclear weapons.</p>

                    <head>234. Editorial Note</head>
                    <p>During the first 3 weeks of September 1962, Director of Central Intelligence
                        McCone, who was on a honeymoon holiday in Europe, received daily briefing
                        cables on the situation in Cuba from Deputy Director Marshall Carter.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> concluded that the
                        development of a costly surface-to-air defense system in Cuba could only be
                        explained if it was designed to mask and protect the introduction of
                        medium-range ballistic missiles. In a series of cables to Carter, <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> pressed his concerns and supported
                        an expanded program of reconnaissance flights over Cuba. Return cables from
                        Carter indicated that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> analysts had
                        considered <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>'s concerns but
                        concluded that the Soviet Union would not run the risk of provoking military
                        reaction from the United States. In Special National Intelligence Estimate
                        85-3-62, September 19, the conclusions of which were cabled to <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> the same day, the intelligence
                        community stated that a decision to introduce medium- and intermediate-range
                        ballistic missiles into Cuba “would indicate a far greater willingness to
                        increase the level of risk in US-Soviet relations than the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has displayed thus far.” The next day, in
                        his final cable in the series, <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> responded that “an offensive Soviet base in Cuba will
                        provide Soviets with most important and effective trading position in
                        connection with all other critical areas and hence they might take
                        unexpected risks to establish such a position.” A report of the arrival of
                        Soviet MRBMs in Cuba, subsequently accepted as the first definitive such
                        report, was received on September 21. For more information and the text of

                    <p rend="center">Conclusion</p>
                    <p>The Soviets have declared a “pause” in the negotiations over Berlin, thus
                        marking the end of a phase which began with the <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> talks
                        last fall. At the same time, they appear to have ruled out a separate treaty
                        in the next few months, and indicated that they envisage an eventual
                        resumption of negotiations. However, it is likely that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will continue to make various
                        unilateral moves in order to accomplish piecemeal and de facto some of the
                        changes which would flow from a peace treaty.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Discussion</p>
                    <p>1. The Soviet pronouncement of 11 September<note n="2" xml:id="d235fn2">For
                            text, see <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi>, September 12, 1962.</note> confirms the end of a
                        phase in negotiations on the Berlin problem which began with the <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> meetings in the fall of 1961. In acknowledging that
                        these talks have failed the Soviets did not renounce further negotiations;
                        they apparently envisage a renewal of contacts with the US later this fall.
                        For the time being, however, the Soviets have almost certainly concluded
                        that continuation of negotiations in the manner of the last year holds
                        little promise of success. At the same time, the Soviets have not chosen, as
                        they previously threatened, to proceed immediately to a separate treaty. The
                        statement of 11 September appears to rule out a separate treaty in the next
                        few months. It is probable that their appraisal of the situation at this
                        time, perhaps associated with the increase of tensions over Cuba, has led
                        the Soviets to conclude once again that a separate treaty which poses a
                        direct challenge to the Western presence in and access to Berlin is too
                        hazardous a course.</p>
                    <p>2. The deferral of a peace treaty, however, need not inhibit the Soviets from
                        taking further action locally to advance their objectives. They have already
                        taken one such step in abolishing their commandant's office in Berlin and
                        replacing it with an East German authority. This step not only does away
                        with one of the most important symbols of Four-Power <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0524"/>responsibility for the whole of Berlin, but
                        it also opens up a variety of possibilities for further encroachments, of
                        which two seem especially significant.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Local Actions</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. First, a logical next step would be for the East German commandant to
                        impose new conditions on Allied access to East Berlin, claiming that the
                        Soviet departure had altered the basis of entry rights. The Soviets almost
                        certainly believe that they can pose this question in a way which will not
                        provoke the Allies to use force to maintain access. Thus, this move would be
                        designed to force the Allies either to acknowledge East German sovereignty
                        in some fashion, an important victory in itself, or to give up the right of
                        access to the eastern half of the city.</p>
                    <p>4. The Soviets would closely observe the outcome of this maneuver in order to
                        judge how far they could safely go in involving East Germany in controls on
                        allied access to West Berlin. For example, if the West acquiesced in new
                        documentary procedures at the sector border, or accepted East German escorts
                        for its trips into East Berlin, the Soviets would be encouraged to believe
                        that similar measures on the autobahn would not be very risky. They might
                        conclude that they could begin to involve East German authorities in Soviet
                        controls over access to West Berlin even before a treaty.</p>
                    <p>5. Second, the Soviets already are taking steps which seem designed to create
                        de facto what they have long demanded of the Allies, namely, a new status
                        for West Berlin alone, guaranteed by Soviet as well as Western forces, to
                        replace the occupation arrangements. They evidently intend to maintain and
                        even intensify their activities in West Berlin and have threatened to
                        retaliate against Allied ground access to the city if the West interferes
                        with or denies Soviet access to West Berlin. They probably expect that,
                        since the West wishes the Soviets to remain in the Berlin Air Safety Center,
                        they can alter the access procedures to and within the city without being
                        thrown out of West Berlin. And if the West does take such action, the
                        Soviets have laid the groundwork for retaliating on the autobahn. To the
                        degree that the Soviets are successful in maintaining their presence in West
                        Berlin, while transferring to East Germany their responsibilities in East
                        Berlin, they will have made a major advance.</p>
                    <p>6. This is a potent maneuver, not only because it advances Soviet objectives
                        vis-à-vis the Western Powers, but because it also has an important effect on
                        Berlin morale. West Berliners are especially sensitive to any suspicion that
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is acquiring a voice in their part
                        of the city. The Soviets realize, of course, that a high state of Berlin
                        morale is a vital ingredient in the Western position and the economic
                        viability of the city.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">General Soviet Tactics</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>7. For the next few months the Soviets are keeping open a number of
                        possibilities including further negotiations, a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> debate, a <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0525"/>meeting with President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, and unilateral encroachments in
                        West Berlin. All this suggests that they are still probing, still assessing
                        Western positions and reactions, and not firmly committed to any fixed
                        course. However, we think it likely that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will continue to make various unilateral moves in
                        order to accomplish piecemeal and de facto some of the changes which would
                        flow from a separate treaty. In this tactical prescription, the signing of a
                        peace treaty might come at the end of the process and merely formalize it,
                        or it might come at some intermediate point but in a manner which would not
                        pose a major showdown. As we have previously estimated, the Soviets will
                        hold open the possibility of negotiation at all stages. However, unless they
                        conclude at some point that the West has become willing to entertain
                        significant concessions, their own stated willingness for negotiations or
                        participation in further talks probably will be largely pro forma and will
                        not reflect any serious expectation that some sort of mutually tolerable
                        compromise could be achieved in this way.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        </hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>8. The Soviets have recently encouraged rumors that they will raise the
                        Berlin issue this fall at the General Assembly. If they do so, it seems
                        certain that they will not simply turn the entire question over to the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for whatever solution it can devise.
                        Instead, they will be seeking certain political results, and the manner in
                        which they present the issue will depend upon their objectives.</p>
                    <p>9. If the Soviets are primarily interested in further negotiations, they
                        would use the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mainly as a means of
                        generating wider pressures among the neutrals for Western concessions. In
                        addition to arguing the merits of their case, they would probably urge the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to take some role in Berlin along the
                        lines of various Soviet proposals for an end to the occupation status. They
                        would almost certainly anticipate that such a UN debate would prompt
                        neutrals to urge a meeting between <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and a temporary maintenance of the status quo while
                        the parties negotiated. If the Soviets proceed in this general manner,
                        therefore, we would conclude that they were prepared to delay a treaty for a
                        longer time and to continue negotiations, possibly under some <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mandate.</p>
                    <p>10. If, however, the Soviets intend to rely principally on additional
                        unilateral measures, and perhaps ultimately sign a separate treaty, then any
                        resort to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would be intended mainly to
                        inhibit the West from sharp and possibly dangerous reactions. In this case,
                        they would probably make some definite moves toward a treaty before raising
                        the question in the General Assembly. By proceeding in this fashion, they
                        would hope to focus debate on the “threat to peace” represented by Western
                        insistence that the Allies would tolerate no diminution of their rights.</p>

                        would not allow Western troops remain Berlin and while permitting access for
                        civilian traffic would not allow access for military purposes. However, he

                            reply, transmitted to the Embassy in Moscow the same day, the United
                            States allowed that a U.S. Air Force plane, which had encountered severe
                            winds in that area, might have overflown Sakhalin. The note stressed
                            that, if the plane had violated Soviet air space, it was unintentional

                        lunch at the Embassy to share the Secretary's impressions of his trip to the
                        Soviet Union. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_US1">Udall</persName> was unable to
                        attend; the Secretary therefore asked that the reporting officer accompany
                        him. Current international political issues were not discussed.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> showed the

                        mentioned that no American literary figure of Frost's standing had ever
                        visited the Soviet Union before. The Secretary stated that he appreciated
                        the opportunity of visiting with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>

                        that he would do his utmost to provide an opportunity for Soviet poet
                        Tvardovsky to see the President when Tvardovsky pays a reciprocal visit in
                        October.</p>
                    <p>The gift of Georgian wine sent by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to the President was mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. The Secretary told of the
                        circumstances which <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0528"/>gave rise to
                        the gift—wine tasting and toasting the health of the President at <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s Black Sea villa.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had not yet received a
                        record of the <persName corresp="#p_US1">Udall</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> conversation. He inquired
                        whether Vinogradov had taken notes, and upon learning that he had, asked
                        whether the Secretary had felt the conversation to be significant. The
                        Secretary replied that the conversation had indeed been significant, and at
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s request outlined in
                        two or three sentences <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        comments on the <gloss target="#t_U21">U-2</gloss> incident in the Far East
                        and on the Berlin question.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> of his
                        conviction that exchanges at the very highest level, up to and including
                        chief of state, were an important contribution to better understanding
                        between <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and USA. <hi rend="italic">Dobrynin</hi> stated that an exchange of visits between President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would mark the high point of his
                        term as Ambassador in Washington, and that he hoped such an exchange would
                        come to pass when the proper time arrived. He was equally receptive, in a
                        general way, to the suggestion that Vice-President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Frol Kozlov</persName> each pay extensive visits to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and USA, respectively.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary mentioned to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        that the recent primary elections seemed to indicate that responsible men
                        were gaining support at the expense of men with outmoded political views,
                        and that he would soon be traveling throughout the nation campaigning for
                        congressional candidates who favor President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s policies.</p>
                    <p>Other conversation revolved around places visited in the Soviet Union,
                        personalities encountered along the way, and opinions on both Russian and
                        American literature.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> mentioned that he planned to
                        attend the opening session of the U.N. General Assembly. He gave no
                        indication who might be coming from Moscow.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> also expressed the hope that
                        Secretary of Agriculture <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName>
                        would be able to visit the Soviet Union within the next year or so. He had
                        talked with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> in
                        connection with the visit of Soviet Minister of Agriculture <persName corresp="#p_PKG1">Pysin</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d237fn4">See

                    <p>Repeatedly during my Soviet Union trip I found myself asking this
                        question:</p>
                    <p>What can the United States do to encourage and accelerate those changes in
                        the Soviet system favorable to our own long-term objectives?</p>
                    <p>Some observers undoubtedly tend to overstate the liberalization that is
                        occurring, but nevertheless there is a consensus that significant changes
                        have taken place in the post-Stalin period. (Perhaps the best recent summary
                        is the Edward Crankshaw article which appeared in the London Observer
                        September 9.)</p>
                    <p>Some of my own tentative conclusions after eleven days in the Soviet Union
                        were these:</p>
                    <p>1. There is an unmistakable and deep-seated respect for American power and
                        American prowess. This means that at all levels the Soviet people are
                        inordinately curious about the American way of getting things done. This is
                        a very healthy condition.</p>
                    <p>2. A pattern of economic incentives and awards is developing in the Soviet
                        Union which, in the long run, might also significantly alter the Soviet
                        system. Some of the more interesting things which we observed (although
                        caveats apply to each) were:</p>
                    <p>a. double-pay wages for the dam-builders on the Siberian frontier;</p>
                    <p>b. ten-year loans for private homes at Bratsk;</p>
                    <p>c. the growing attachment of the managers and the elite to what one might
                        call dacha-living.</p>
                    <p>3. There is evidence of a growing awareness by the Soviets that their ability
                        to compete is inhibited by the secrecy and suspicion which dominate their
                        thinking. The experience of the Soviets with their exchange programs—and the
                        activities of the vital State Committee for the Coordination of Scientific
                        Research Work—has apparently convinced them that a limited “open-window”
                        policy is beneficial to their own system. It is predictable that this window
                        will be opened wider as time passes.</p>
                    <p>4. The Communist Party apparatus will, of course, remain dominant, but much
                        important decision-making power is gravitating towards <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0530"/>the scientists, engineers and managers who
                        are the doers who make their system go and also have strong Party ties. For
                        the most part, these are pragmatic men who are far more interested in
                        building their country than in pursuing Marxian theories of revolution. A
                        form of agnosticism, one might say, is showing up.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, it is my feeling that we have an opportunity to influence this
                        process of liberalization, and I strongly recommend that a fresh study be
                        made of this whole problem to determine what new courses of action might be
                        pursued with profit.</p>
                    <p>As a starter, it seems to me we are missing a bet in not arranging more
                        high-level exchanges. Visits to the Soviet Union by the Vice President, the
                        Attorney General and selected members of the Cabinet would be very
                        worthwhile. Return visits by men in high places—<persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName>, for example—would be equally effective.</p>

                    <p>In a letter of September 15, 1962, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> informed Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that he was “happy to note your suggestion that
                        you are prepared to negotiate a treaty banning nuclear tests in the
                        atmosphere, in outer space and under water in the immediate future. Now that
                        the subcommittee on nuclear test ban is continuing in session throughout the
                        recess in the 18-Nation Disarmament Conference, I think we should make a
                        serious effort to work out such an agreement in time to meet the target date
                        of January 1, 1963.” <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> added that the U.S. had
                        prepared such a treaty. For text of <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s letter,

                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> responded in a letter of
                        September 28. Referring to <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s comment that a
                        serious effort be made to work out an agreement by January 1, 1963,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> stated that the
                        Soviets would not keep the United States waiting. If an agreement were
                        reached on a ban in three environments, he continued, “there remains the
                        question of underground tests.” Referring to the suggestion of British
                        scientists at the recent Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs
                        that automatic unmanned seismic stations could help determine whether an
                        underground tremor was a nuclear blast or an earthquake, Khrushchev stated:
                            <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0531"/>“After thinking this suggestion
                        over we came to the conclusion that it can be accepted if this would make it
                        easier to reach an agreement. In this case it could be provided in the
                        treaty banning all nuclear weapon tests that automatic seismic stations be
                        set up both near the borders of the nuclear states and 2-3 such stations
                        directly on the territory of the states possessing nuclear weapons—in the
                        areas most frequently subjected to earthquakes.” <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> proposed that, after reaching agreement on a
                        three environment ban, negotiations continue on an underground ban and that
                        all nuclear powers refrain from carrying out underground tests during the
                        negotiations. For text, see ibid., pages 575-579.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> replied in an October 8 letter: “I am
                        encouraged by the areas in which we are in accord and by your statement that
                        the Soviet Union is prepared to make ‘new efforts’ in order to conclude an
                        early agreement. Certainly it would seem we are agreed in our approach to
                        three types of tests—in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water.”
                        With respect to underground tests, <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> stated that
                        the “development of automatic unmanned seismic mechanisms might very well,
                        if properly worked out, facilitate agreement on the means of actually
                        detecting underground explosions—although my scientists indicate that it
                        would require much more than the two or three such stations you mentioned as
                        being located directly in the areas most frequently subjected to
                        earthquakes. Of course, these mechanical devices would still have to be
                        supplemented by a modest number of on-site inspections.” For text, see

                    <p>We are in general agreement with the tentative conclusions which Secretary
                        Udall reached after 11 days in the Soviet Union as to the direction <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0532"/>Soviet society is taking. With
                        regard to specific points made by the Secretary we have the following
                        observations. The stressing of economic incentives and awards has been a
                        growing practice. However, with reference to the specific examples cited by
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_US1">Udall</persName>, premium wages for
                        priority work in Siberia and other “frontier areas” was standard practice
                        even under Stalin. As for 10-year loans for private homes and the growing
                        attachment of the elite for dacha-living, recent Government pressures have
                        been in the opposite direction, i.e., loans for private homes and dacha
                        construction are now much more difficult to obtain than just a few months
                        ago.</p>
                    <p>It is true that the Soviets see benefits in the exchanges program with the
                        U.S. and are as a result compelled to pursue a limited “open window” policy.
                        It should be noted, however, that the Soviets have very clear objectives in
                        the exchanges program, utilizing exchanges primarily for the purpose of
                        obtaining as much technical and technological information as possible from
                        the U.S. while giving as little as possible in return. They are also
                        interested in prestigious exchanges, such as performing arts. However, where
                        the exchanges deal with subjects such as exhibits, dissemination of
                        information, etc., which have an obvious impact on Soviet citizenry, and in
                        which we have greater interest than the Soviets, we find the going very
                        heavy indeed. We have recently concluded time-consuming negotiations to
                        arrive at the present exchanges agreement and have the problem of how to
                        utilize these exchanges to our best overall advantage constantly under
                        review. Thus, we do not feel that a fresh study of the problem is called for
                        at this time.</p>
                    <p>Finally, as a general proposition we recognize that there is a liberalization
                        process taking place within the Soviet Union. In our view, however, this is
                        bound to be an extremely slow process with a dynamic of its own and while we
                        should of course do whatever is possible to further this development, it
                        would be a mistake to believe that we can exert undue influence on it
                        through such actions as high-level exchanges.</p>
                    <p>With regard to increased high-level exchanges, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_US1">Udall</persName>'s trip was of course arranged under
                        the Exchanges Program. It should be noted, however, that the Soviets, in
                        welcoming such exchanges, attach considerable political significance to them
                        and expect the high-level visitor to have a similar political motivation.
                        For this reason we believe that we should reserve high-level visits for
                        times when we have something important to convey to the Soviets. A visit to
                        the USSR by the Attorney General would have inescapable overtones which may
                        or may not be desirable at any given time. In this connection, the Soviet
                        Government utilizes such exchanges to purvey to the Soviet people and the
                        world a sense of normalcy in U.S.-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        relations which does not in fact exist. We do not, for example, believe that
                        the current time of increasing tensions between the U.S. and the USSR is a
                        propitious one for high-level visits with <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0533"/>accompanying atmospherics. Lastly, the only visit to the
                        Soviet Union which would have a real and deep impact on both Soviet leaders
                        and people at large would in our estimation be a visit by the President.
                        Obviously the current state of U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations and the international situation are not
                        propitious for such a visit.</p>
                    <p>As regards the prospect of return visits by men in high places such as
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Frol Kozlov</persName>, we understand that
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_US1">Udall</persName>'s suggestion is in
                        part motivated by his belief that <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName> is a likely successor to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Indeed, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_US1">Udall</persName> has asked that the Department give him its consensus
                        on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s probable successor. A
                        paper addressed to this problem is attached and you may wish to give it to
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_US1">Udall</persName> when you see him. In
                        this connection it should be pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName> visited the U.S. only two years ago when he was a
                        First Deputy Premier. At the present moment, while he holds high offices in
                        the Communist Party, he does not hold an important position in the Soviet
                        Government which might provide a convenient pretext for an invitation. In
                        summary, we believe that high-level visits either way between the U.S. and
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should have greater motivation
                        than the belief that they will serve to educate Soviet leadership or open up
                        Soviet society.</p>

                    <p>PROBABLE SUCCESSION TO PRESENT SOVIET LEADERSHIP FOLLOWING DEATH OR
                        RETIREMENT OF <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">N.S. KHRUSHCHEV</persName>
                    </p>
                    <p>It generally is estimated that the departure of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> from the top leadership scene will pose less of
                        an immediate problem in the transfer of authority and the maintenance of
                        stable control channels than did the death of Stalin. The top group around
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, more accustomed to
                        the exercise of both individual and collective responsibility, should be
                        able to retain authority as a leadership “collective” for a more or less
                        extended interregnum period. Some members of this leadership collective are
                        expected to exercise relatively more authority and leadership initiative
                        than others, and it seems inevitable that even initially some focus of
                        authority will be evident. By general consensus, this initial focus most
                        likely will be on the personages of Party Second Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">F.R. Kozlov</persName>, Supreme Soviet Presidium
                        Chairman <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">L.I. Brezhnev</persName>, First Deputy
                        Premiers <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">A.N. Kosygin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">A.I. Mikoyan</persName> and Party Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SMA1">M.A. Suslov</persName>, <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0534"/>all members of the Party Presidium and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s leading lieutenants. For the
                        sake of displaying continuity with the past older but lesser figures like
                        N.M. Shvernik and O.V. Kuusinen initially may be given prestige attention
                        without, however, responsibility permitting the exercise of added
                        influence.</p>
                    <p>There is less of a consensus concerning possible later shifts in the top
                        leadership structure although some of the more dynamic members of the lesser
                        leadership are expected to rise in authority and importance. Of those
                        already on the Party Presidium, A.P. Kirilenko and G.I. Voronov (First
                        Deputy Chairmen of the Central Committee's Bureau for the RSFSR), D.
                        Polyansky (RSFSR Premier) and N.V. Podgorny (First Secretary of the
                        Ukrainian Communist Party) may fall in this category.</p>
                    <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName> stands high on the
                        list of possible successors to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and not infrequently is termed the heir apparent,
                        there can be no assurance that he will emerge sooner or later as the “most
                        equal of equals” in the top leadership. His position as <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s next-in-command in the Central
                        Committee Secretariat both provides him with the opportunity to consolidate
                        his personal position and identifies him to Presidium associates as a person
                        whose authority may need to be “contained” if their own relative positions
                        are not to suffer.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> recently has
                        expressed views similar to those outlined above. Somewhat more specifically,
                        he feels that if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> should
                        depart from the scene now <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> might well assume the
                        major Party and Government responsibilities, respectively. As power
                        relationships within the leading group are at best unstable and shift with
                        different times and pressures, however, the Ambassador feels that should
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> remain at the helm the
                        chances are good that in time neither <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName> nor <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                        will figure as an heir apparent.</p>

                    <p>In a letter of September 28, 1962, to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, in which he discussed a nuclear test ban (see <ref target="#d239">Document 239</ref>), Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> also discussed Cuba and Berlin and protested
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s September 7 request to Congress for
                        authority to call up the Ready Reserve. He called the request “a step making
                        the atmosphere red-hot” and one “that, naturally, forces the other side to
                        respond in kind. What could it lead to, all the <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0535"/>more that you consider that the U.S. has the right to
                        attack Cuba whenever it wishes?” <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> concluded his letter: “I would ask you to
                        correctly understand our anxiety and not to do anything that could further
                        aggravate the atmosphere and even expose the world. We on our part again say
                        to you that we will do nothing with regard to West Berlin until after the
                        elections in the U.S. After the elections, apparently in the second half of
                        November, it would be necessary in our opinion to continue the dialogue.”

                    <p>On September 29, 1962, Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> forwarded Talking Points on the Congo to President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> for use at a luncheon
                        meeting the next day with British Foreign Secretary Lord Home. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s paper expressed concern over the
                        possibility that prolonged civil war in the Congo would “create a power

                        consequence of failure in the Congo “would be extremely serious,” resulting
                        in “continuous civil war, and a golden opportunity for the Soviets.” For

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked me to lunch alone
                        today. In discussing inadequacies of his Embassy, he pointed out that the
                        last time Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> visited the
                        United States, he stayed at Blair House, and had not been aware of the need
                        for better accommodations. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        said he was hopeful that this time <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would stay in the Embassy and realize the need
                        for a better one.</p>
                    <p>This gave me the opportunity to ask when he was likely to come. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said this had not yet been decided
                        in Moscow. When I said the rumors seem to indicate the latter part of
                        November, he added “or early December.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked for my personal
                        opinion as to the wisdom of such a visit at this time. I said I found this
                        difficult to answer, to which he interjected that this was a difficult
                        question which was why he was asking my opinion. I went on to say that
                        frequent contacts between the President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would be helpful as I was convinced that many
                        misunderstandings existed and that at least some of these could be cleared
                        up through closer contact. On the other hand, I said he must be aware of the
                        feeling aroused in this country by developments in Cuba, which did not
                        provide a very good background against which to discuss other questions. I
                        also said that I could not observe, in the exchanges which we had had so
                        far, much hope for a successful settlement of the Berlin question.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> indicated he agreed with
                        this view and said that such a meeting was bound to generate hopes which
                        might result in disappointment. He also mentioned the imminence of American
                        elections.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had
                        told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        <note n="2" xml:id="d243fn2">For a record of <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s conversation with Gromyko, October 6, see <ref target="frus1961-63v15">

                            pp. 348-351.</note> that our elections need play no role in negotiations
                        about Berlin, but said that the Republican Party apparently intended to
                        exploit the Cuban issue in the coming campaign, which might further arouse
                        public sentiment. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0537"/>said that purely from the point of
                        view of elections, he assumed that next Fall would be the ideal time for a
                        meeting, but then went on to indicate his own view that early December of
                        this year might be an appropriate time. My impression is that he will
                        recommend against any visit at this time but that if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> insists on coming, it should be
                        some time in early December.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked me for my opinion
                        as to what area I thought there was the most hope for some progress in
                        improving our relations. In reply, I said it seemed to me the logical way to
                        approach this question was to seek areas in which our interests in the
                        settlement of a problem coincide most closely. I said that in theory, it
                        seemed to me that an agreement on atomic testing best met this criterion. On
                        the other hand, from my talks with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> before my departure from Moscow, I had been
                        obliged to conclude that there appeared to be little hope of an agreement on
                        this problem and had so informed the Secretary. I said I thought this was
                        due to the firmness of their position on the inspection issue. I said I
                        could not see why they could not accept a ban on atmospheric, outer space,
                        and underwater tests. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said
                        they could not agree to this as long as we took the position we were going
                        to test underground, and said he did not see why we could not agree to a
                        moratorium of several years. In reply, I referred to Congressional and
                        public opinion as well as the fact that we had a particular problem in
                        keeping our scientists engaged in this work in the absence of any indication
                        that the work would go forward.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> observed that we could
                        always have a program of tests prepared for us in case it became necessary.
                        He also suggested that we could educate Congressional and public opinion. I
                        said I understood there was also a considerable division of opinion within
                        the Administration and among the experts. I cautioned him, however, that I
                        was not really in touch with people competent in this field and he should
                        not, therefore, attach much importance to my expressions of personal opinion
                        on this subject.</p>
                    <p>When <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> indicated that the
                        Soviet military were strongly opposed to an agreement which would leave open
                        the possibility of underground tests, I said this seemed strange to me since
                        I assumed that underground tests would mainly be valuable for the
                        development of small arms, and that we were probably ahead of them in this
                        field. It therefore seemed more to their advantage than ours, from a
                        military point of view, to leave open the possibility of underground tests.
                        Dobrynin replied that if this were, in fact, the case, then we should be
                        able to agree to a moratorium. He also referred to the possible use of
                        automatic unmanned seismic stations, and argued that these should be able to
                        establish whether an explosion was due to an earthquake or an atomic device.
                        He said that earthquakes did not spread their effects evenly, <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0538"/>whereas an atomic explosion did, and that
                        by comparing the readings on various stations around the location of the
                        disturbance, one could easily tell its nature. I observed that this would
                        require a considerable number of stations, and I did not know enough to
                        judge how reliable such a system would be, but understood that our experts
                        considered that some inspection of doubtful cases would, in any case, be
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>Turning to general disarmament, I referred to my conversation with Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> on our zonal
                        inspection plan,<note n="3" xml:id="d243fn3">See <ref target="#d214">Document 214</ref>.</note> and said that since this met most of
                        their objections to our proposals and was in accord with their principle,
                        that the amount of inspection should be commensurate with the amount of
                        disarmament, I could not understand why they had not more seriously
                        considered our proposals. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        did not seem to have any answer to this but merely observed that he had to
                        admit that we had at last produced a fairly comprehensive disarmament
                        program.</p>
                    <p>On the Berlin question, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked
                        me if I did not think that our principals, meaning Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, had at least made some little progress in their
                        last talk. I said that there had been some little movement in the talks
                        between us; that anything new, no matter how slight, looked important. He
                        said he did not have a full report, but was going to New York shortly to see
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> observed that of course no
                        progress had been made on the principal question, which was the removal of
                        our troops, but as the hour was late, we did not pursue the matter
                        further.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Sino-Soviet Relations Continue To Deteriorate</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The closing of the last two Soviet consulates in China is the latest
                        illustration of the steady deterioration in governmental relations resulting
                        from the Sino-Soviet controversy over party doctrine.</p>
                    <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0539"/>
                    <p>According to some reports, the consulates were closed at Peiping's request.
                        The Soviet Embassy in Moscow has tried to put a better face on the matter by
                        depicting the closing as an economy measure. It is possible that the
                        Chinese, taking a leaf from their treatment of US consuls in China during
                        1949 and 1950, conducted such a campaign of harassment that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> decided it had no recourse but to shut
                        down the consulates.</p>
                    <p>Some evidence of Chinese harassment is provided by White Russians who
                        recently left Manchuria. According to one report, Chinese authorities
                        rejected protests of the Soviet consul general in Harbin relating to
                        procedures governing the departure of Russian residents. The Chinese were
                        said to have replied that they were masters in the area. According to the
                        White Russian refugees, Chinese troops threw a security cordon around the
                        Harbin consulate several weeks before it closed. At the same time, the
                        Chinese reportedly raided the quarters of a Soviet citizens' organization in
                        Harbin. The activities of such organizations have been directed since World
                        War II by Soviet consular officials.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese pressures against the consulates may have reflected Peiping's
                        view that they provided bases for subversion that could not be ignored in
                        the context of the growing estrangement between the two countries. In this
                        connection, the Chinese could have recalled the subversive activity fostered
                        by Soviet consulates in Sinkiang during the 1940s.</p>
                    <p>In its anxiety to diminish the Russian presence in China, Peiping appears to
                        be expediting the emigration of White Russians, whom the Chinese regard as a
                        suspect segment of the population. Well over 400 White Russians arrived in
                        Hong Kong in September. This total compared with figures of about 170 in
                        August and of only 50 or so per month earlier in the year.</p>
                    <p>Peiping's concerns about security have apparently led to increases in the
                        contingent of border guards along the Soviet frontier, at least near
                        Manchouli. Reports from the White Russians appear to be corroborated by a
                        letter received by a recent Chinese Communist defector. The letter refers to
                        the training of a Chinese public security unit for border-guard duty near
                        Manchouli. The defector believes that this activity reflects Chinese
                        Communist concern about subversive operations in the frontier area.</p>
                    <p>These measures to tighten state security have been accompanied by allusions
                        in recent Chinese propaganda to “revisionist” efforts to subvert members of
                        the Chinese Communist Party. A sign that these efforts may be continuing was
                        provided by the publication in <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> on 28 September
                        of a “new document” purporting to be a decipherment of a hitherto missing
                        Lenin draft. The Soviets claim that the document is an earlier version of
                        certain chapters of Lenin's report on “The Immediate Tasks of Soviet Rule,”
                        which he had presented at the April 1918 session of the highest governmental
                        body in Russia at that time.</p>
                    <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0540"/>
                    <p>The “new document” was offered by <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> as a rebuttal
                        to Chinese jeers at Soviet “economism”—i.e., an excessive concern for
                        economic development, with a consequent refusal to wage the struggle against
                        the West with sufficient militancy. Lenin was represented as affirming that
                        political tasks are subordinate to economic tasks after a Communist party
                        has come to power. “Agitators,” according to Lenin's newly discovered
                        precepts, were useful mainly for the tasks of seizing power; later and more
                        complex economic tasks were said to require “practical leaders and
                        organizers.” The implication that Communist China should borrow from the
                        experience of the USSR was contained in Lenin's alleged observation about
                        learning from the “neighboring and very much more developed countries.”</p>
                    <p>The “new document” thus invokes Lenin in support of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s long-standing condemnation of
                        the extremist economic programs promoted by Mao and his associates against
                        the objections of more realistic sections of the party. The Chinese leaders
                        are obviously sensitive about such appeals by Moscow to susceptible elements
                        in China. Recent Chinese statements ominously suggest the vulnerability of
                        such elements in any new party purge.</p>
                    <p>For those who might have questions about the presence of these unreliables in
                        the armed forces, Communist China's chief of staff included some pointed
                        remarks in a speech on 6 October. He “expressed the hope,” according to the
                        Chinese Communist news agency, that the army would be the agent of further
                        victories “in the defense of the party central committee and Chairman Mao.”
                        He exhorted the armed forces to heightened vigilance against the country's
                        enemies “no matter who they are.”</p>

                    <p>Fully recognizing the importance to U.S. security of disrupting activities
                        such as those of Drummond, must nonetheless question whether, in fact,
                        Drummond case (which according to news reports has been going on in at least
                        partially controlled fashion for years) could not have been resolved in a
                        way that would meet those security requirements without involving such cost
                        to ourselves.</p>
                    <p>Apart from the ill effect on Embassy operations and prestige of retaliatory
                            <gloss target="#t_PNG1">PNG</gloss> actions, consideration must also be
                        given to the personal security of Embassy officers who are required in the
                        course of their official duties to be exposed to whatever form of
                        maltreatment the Soviet Secret Police find appropriate or amusing. Given the
                        nature of this society, the Soviets can always beat us in the application of
                        humiliation, force, duress and coercion. Midthun received the most gentle
                        possible kind of treatment. Commander Smith got a small taste of what can
                        happen. Military Attaché officers, because of the nature of their
                        assignments including travel to and in isolated areas, are particularly
                        vulnerable, though this is also true to a lesser extent of non-military as
                        well.</p>
                    <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0542"/>
                    <p>Would hope foregoing considerations could be brought to the attention of all
                        appropriate elements of U.S. Government and kept in mind in the not unlikely
                        event of future cases involving Soviet diplomatic personnel.</p>
                    <p>As regards our reaction now to Smith and Midthun expulsions, believe Soviets
                        consider balance has been effected. (The circumstances of the Midthun
                        action, i.e., failure thus far to document allegation against him, would
                        indicate they do not want to go beyond simple man-for-man reciprocity by
                        establishing a second full-blown incident.) Department will have noted that
                        two elements of U.S. Government involved in Prokhorov/Vyrodov affairs have
                        been involved in retaliatory actions here: Navy (Smith and Drummond) and
                            <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> (Midthun's previous association with
                        the bureau cannot be unknown to the Soviets).</p>
                    <p>In the circumstances, believe we should not propose further expulsion of
                        Soviets in U.S. in connection this matter since Soviet Government would
                        undoubtedly consider this as opening a new round.</p>

                    <p>REPORT OF CONVERSATION WITH AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">DOBRYNIN</persName> ON SATURDAY, OCTOBER 13th, REGARDING CUBA AND OTHER
                        SUBJECTS</p>
                    <p>A week ago Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> called
                        my office to say that he understood I was leaving for Africa and would like
                        to have our “long postponed luncheon” before my departure.</p>
                    <p>I met him at the U.S.S.R. Embassy on 16th Street at 1 p.m. on October 13th.
                        With the exception of an occasional exchange of courtesies at diplomatic
                        functions, this was the first time I had talked with him.</p>
                    <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515" facs="0543"/>
                    <p>It was a frank, free-wheeling discussion, lasting more than an hour and a
                        half. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s manner was pleasant,
                        with a show of reasonableness and concern about the current drift in
                        Soviet-American relations.</p>
                    <p>At my first opportunity, I expressed deep disappointment that no more
                        progress had been made in reducing tensions and concern over the
                        consequences of a further decline. I said that since I was speaking wholly
                        unofficially, he should not attempt to read anything into my remarks. I
                        would like to be utterly frank with him.</p>
                    <p>Almost immediately <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> brought up
                        the question of Cuba and expressed worry and surprise at the intensity of
                        U.S. public reaction.</p>
                    <p>In response to his question as to why we attached such importance to a
                        relatively small island, I outlined the history of U.S.-Cuban relations and
                        drew a parallel to the situation in 1898, the presence of Spanish misrule,
                        and the U.S. public agitation that abetted the outbreak of war.</p>
                    <p>When he protested that the Soviet presence in Cuba was no greater provocation
                        than the U.S. presence in Turkey, I pointed out that the present
                        Administration had inherited a status quo that had grown up since the war.
                        In some areas the advantage in this status quo had been with us, in others
                        with Moscow; in still others it was a stand-off.</p>
                    <p>Our presence in Greece and Turkey, for instance, represented our reaction to
                        Stalin's military and political pressures against these two countries
                        following the war. It had become part of a status quo which in all its
                        complexity could safely be changed only by negotiation with reciprocal
                        benefits to each side.</p>
                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> Administration had hoped and expected that
                        we could in fact negotiate a more rational set of relationships, easing the
                        various danger points on a basis of reciprocal action to everyone's
                        benefit.</p>
                    <p>However, in Cuba the U.S.S.R. had unilaterally altered this status quo by
                        introducing a wholly new element. Our reaction, in these circumstances,
                        should have been foreseeable.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, many U.S. students of Soviet affairs were soberly convinced that
                        the U.S.S.R. had made this move deliberately to provoke a U.S. military
                        response against Cuba on the theory that this would divert our energies from
                        Berlin, and elsewhere, and enable Soviet spokesmen to charge us with
                        aggression in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>If this kind of thinking had in fact played a part in the Soviet analysis, it
                        was extremely dangerous. If we did move into Cuba in response to some overt
                        act or offensive build-up by the U.S.S.R., a global chain of events might be
                        set in motion which could have catastrophic consequences.</p>
                    <p>For instance, the Soviets might then be tempted to take what they would term
                        “counter-action” in Berlin and perhaps Turkey; and the <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0544"/>United States, by that time in an extremely
                        tense mood, would react with vigor.</p>
                    <p>The U.S.S.R., in turn, would feel pressed by the Chinese and other extremists
                        to counter our moves, and we would be on our way together down the long
                        slippery slide.</p>
                    <p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> if he had read <hi rend="italic">The Guns of August.</hi>
                        <note n="2" xml:id="d246fn2"> Barbara Tuchman, The Guns of August, New York,
                            1962.</note> He said “only a three-page summary.”</p>
                    <p>I urged him to read at least the first few chapters in which he would see a
                        pattern of politico-military action and counter-action that could be
                        repeated in the next six months.</p>
                    <p>In July 1914, men of intelligence in Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, France
                        and England, all quite conscious of the forces which were feeding the
                        approaching holocaust, found themselves enmeshed in internal pressures,
                        commitments and precedents which left them powerless to avoid the
                        inevitable. It would be the greatest folly in history if we were to repeat
                        this insane process in the nuclear age.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked me what, in the
                        circumstances, I thought could be done in regard to Cuba. Stressing that I
                        was speaking solely as an individual, I suggested three moves that the
                        U.S.S.R. could sponsor to ease the situation.</p>
                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> should remind his
                        government of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s
                        sharp distinction between defensive and offensive weapons in his recent
                        statement. I was particularly concerned on this point because current
                        reports indicated that Soviet shipments were in fact beginning to include
                        weapons which had a clearly offensive capacity.</p>
                    <p>If this continued, it could produce—with the help of some incident
                        perpetrated perhaps by individuals striving to provoke another “Remember the
                        Maine” incident—the very conflict which the Administration is anxious to
                        avoid. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had
                        committed himself to act under certain specific circumstances. This was a
                        clear commitment, and the U.S.S.R. should not take it lightly.</p>
                    <p>2. From many reports, <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> now had
                        ample defensive arms with which to protect himself from casual landings. The
                        U.S.S.R. should tell him that under present circumstances no more arms will
                        be shipped. The U.S.S.R. should then ask Castro himself to make a statement
                        announcing that the defense of Cuba was assured and that no more arms were
                        needed. Moscow could then inform us that no more arms would be shipped.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> should be asked by Moscow to
                        state that he has no design on his neighbors, that his entire energies would
                        henceforth be devoted to the economic development of Cuba, and that he
                        sought only peaceful <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0545"/>competition
                        with other Latin American nations. His decision not to indulge in further
                        subversion, propaganda, and expansion in neighboring Latin American
                        countries would, of course, have to be confirmed by deeds. However, Soviet
                        assurances on this point would serve to reduce some of the current tensions
                        and give us all a breathing spell.</p>
                    <p>If some progress along these lines were not possible, I had deep forebodings
                        about the weeks ahead.</p>
                    <p>To all of this <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> appeared to
                        listen intently. I believe he was impressed.</p>
                    <p>He answered that in spite of our worries, the U.S.S.R. was not shipping
                        offensive weapons and well understood the dangers of doing so. Moreover, it
                        was unreasonable for the U.S., as a major power, to expect a small, weak
                        country such as Cuba to make such public concessions to U.S. public opinion
                        even though both the U.S.S.R. and Cuba might accept all three points in
                        principle.</p>
                    <p>Why, he asked repeatedly, do we get so excited about so small a nation?
                        Although the U.S.S.R. could not let Cuba down, they had no desire to
                        complicate the situation further. Was it not possible for us to negotiate a
                        modus vivendi with Castro directly?</p>
                    <p>I commented that Cuba had initiated the current conflict. Indeed, in 1959
                        most Americans had strongly applauded <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>'s revolution. If <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> were misinformed about the types of weapons now
                        arriving in Cuba, it would not be the first time in diplomatic history that
                        this had occurred. As long as Soviet weapons flowed into Cuba and Cuban
                        money was used to subvert Latin American countries which we were striving to
                        assist into the 20th century, the situation would remain dangerously
                        explosive.</p>
                    <p>I hoped that his government would see the danger and act accordingly to help
                        ease the tensions.</p>
                    <p>Without directly responding to my remarks, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> referred to Max Frankel's story in the morning
                        Times which cited agitation by various private agencies, Cuban and American,
                        to provoke a “Maine incident” with the connivance of U.S. official groups. I
                        replied that our government would have no part in such an operation, that we
                        were genuinely worried, and that his government should view the situation
                        with serious concern.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then switched the subject:
                        What did I think of a meeting between <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and the President this fall or early winter?</p>
                    <p>Speaking purely for myself, I said I felt that such a meeting would be
                        worthwhile only if we could be assured in advance of some areas of
                        agreement. Otherwise it would only result, as had the meeting in June 1961,
                        in a further sharpening of our differences, in a frustration of public
                        hopes, and a strengthening of the extremists in both Russia and America.</p>
                    <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0546"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that this was precisely
                        his view; but on what subjects could we agree?</p>
                    <p>I suggested several possibilities. For instance, the U.S.S.R. could state
                        that it endorsed the Cuban position (along the lines of my suggestion) that
                        no more arms were needed and that no more would be shipped; also that it
                        endorsed the proposed Cuban statement that Cuba would forego expansionist
                        exploits and would henceforth concentrate on internal development.</p>
                    <p>We should also be able to agree on a nuclear test ban in the atmosphere and
                        under the sea, as well as cooperation between our two governments to conduct
                        research in regard to underground testing, with a report on this subject to
                        be prepared within some stated period. On the basis of this agreement, we
                        could then announce our intention to work together to discourage other
                        nations, including China, from developing nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>Parenthetically, I added that I could not understand the U.S.S.R.'s
                        reluctance to deal seriously with arms control and reductions on a broad
                        scale. I said that in February 1957 I had chided <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> about being a poor Marxist, since otherwise he
                        should assume that a capitalist nation such as the U.S. could not agree to
                        arms reduction without facing economic collapse—and should therefore press
                        for an agreement which we could not refuse.<note n="3" xml:id="d246fn3">For

                    </p>
                    <p>What, I asked, was holding up the serious, thoughtful negotiations on the
                        broad subject of arms control that most of us hoped would by now be
                        underway? The longer we postponed such discussion, the harder it would be to
                        reach agreement. In the present competition we had all the immediate
                        advantages since our economy had plenty of slack; yet it was a crazy,
                        dangerous contest for all concerned, however you looked at it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said frankly that in the
                        U.S.S.R., as in the U.S., there were differences of view, that suspicions
                        ran deep, and that no generals ever had enough weapons.</p>
                    <p>In further references to a meeting between <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and the President, I suggested that agreement
                        could be reached to put Berlin on ice until we could discuss the situation
                        in a less emotional atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>Why not frankly say just that? We realized that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was in a difficult situation because of his
                        statements four years ago that we would soon be out of Berlin; but surely he
                        must realize that we were totally committed to staying there.</p>
                    <p>I then urged with great emphasis that the U.S.S.R. should not minimize the
                        depth of this commitment. On the essential point of the U.S. presence in
                        Berlin, we have absolutely no room for maneuver.</p>
                    <pb n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0547"/>
                    <p>The 11,000 Western troops in Berlin had no military significance. They were
                        purely a symbol of our rights there.</p>
                    <p>If we increased the symbolic number by 5000, the U.S.S.R. would react because
                        the symbol had been changed; just so, our friends would react if we moved
                        the symbol downward by 5000. For this reason, there was no basis for a
                        negotiation of our presence under present conditions.</p>
                    <p>Even if differences should arise with our allies as to how to respond to
                            “<persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s pressures,” we
                        Americans would be forced to react, alone if necessary—move for move, threat
                        for threat. We had absolutely no alternative. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> simply must understand this, or there could be a
                        tragedy.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> nodded but said nothing.</p>
                    <p>These were some of the things that could be agreed on in a
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> meeting. They wouldn't assure world peace; but
                        they would give both nations a fresh chance and some urgently needed room
                        for maneuver and reduced tensions. Unless some such understandings could be
                        reached, a meeting between the two principals might cause us to lose more
                        ground.</p>
                    <p>We then talked briefly of Germany as a whole. I said that many of us shared
                        Soviet concern over German's past tendencies towards aggression, and that
                        “their Germans” were largely Prussians who had traditionally led the
                        parades. Why not get rid of Ulbricht so that we could all talk more
                        reasonably?</p>
                    <p>Our support of the Common Market and British participation was not only a
                        result of our desire to see the construction of an efficient, united Europe,
                        but because we wanted to see Germany peacefully and politically involved as
                        a member of a united Europe, with Britain—which has great skill in this
                        respect—acting as a balancing force. I stressed that this political
                        objective was also in Moscow's ultimate interest.</p>
                    <p>A re-united, floating Germany, as an (unlikely) alternative, could scarcely
                        resist an effort to bargain Moscow and Washington against each other, with
                        even more unpredictable and potentially explosive results.</p>
                    <p>We then talked briefly of Afghanistan. I said that if what the U.S.S.R.
                        really wants there is a buffer state, we should work together frankly to
                        this end. The U.S. has absolutely no military objectives there. Indeed, in
                        1953 when the Afghan government asked us for military equipment and a
                        military training mission, we refused because Afghanistan was traditionally
                        neutral, directly bordering on the U.S.S.R., and under such circumstances a
                        U.S. military mission would be provocative. It was unfortunate that the
                        Soviets had not shown similar restraint in regard to Cuba.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> answered that the U.S.S.R.
                        agreed on Afghanistan's proper neutral position, but that we Americans were
                        encouraging or at <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0548"/>least tolerating
                        Pakistan's “belligerent pressures” against Afghanistan. This was bad for
                        everyone and seriously jeopardized the proper buffer-state status of the
                        Afghans. (This was his only barbed comment.)</p>
                    <p>Finally, we turned to mainland China. I reiterated our intention of defending
                        Taiwan against any Chinese attack and our determination not to allow Chiang
                        to start trouble. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that
                        Chiang was dangerous to all of us; I responded that he was far less so than
                            <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>.</p>
                    <p>In response to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s questions, I
                        discussed Formosa's economic success, its land reform, high literacy, the
                        deep distaste of its people for the mainland government, and their
                        preference even for Japanese rule if they were ever forced to choose between
                        the two.</p>
                    <p>I said that in my recent visits to Asia I found widespread understanding of
                        the extent of Communist China's failure. The hopes created by the “Great
                        Leap Forward” were totally shattered.</p>
                    <p>Why, therefore, didn't the U.S.S.R. really take charge in Hanoi and insist on
                        a live-and-let-live solution in East and Southeast Asia?</p>
                    <p>Of course, much depended on Laos. This was the test of everyone's
                        intentions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> insisted with vigor that we
                        were incorrect in saying that Moscow had allowed the Vietminh to remain in
                        Laos. According to Soviet information, they were now practically all
                        gone.</p>
                    <p>Why then, I asked, not allow the ICC to look and see for itself? He said that
                        this could be worked out.</p>
                    <p>We returned to China's future. I pointed out that China, unlike Russia,
                        lacked key natural resources—particularly oil and arable land. Someday the
                        U.S.S.R. and the U.S., working together, could bring effective pressure to
                        bear on China—the U.S.S.R. through oil and the U.S. through food. Why should
                        we delay?</p>
                    <p>I said we understood that the Soviets were now supplying 70% of China's
                        petroleum; he commented “It's more than that,” and he added that oil would
                        soon be flowing directly to China from the “newly discovered unlimited
                        Siberian oil fields only a few hundred kilometers from the Chinese
                        borders.”</p>
                    <p>I asked if this did not cause concern in Moscow since a successful grab by
                        the Peking government for the new Siberian oil and Siberia's wheat potential
                        could make China self-sufficient. “In that case,” I added facetiously, “we
                        might help guarantee your borders—provided by that time we are on speaking
                        terms, with no Berlin and Cuba to cause us trouble.”</p>
                    <p>Seriously, I asked, why should we quarrel? Neither we nor the U.S.S.R. can
                        run the world, since it is much too diversified. Burmese want to be Burmese;
                        Brazilians, Brazilians; Japanese, Japanese. No one wants to be run by either
                        Moscow or Washington. Together we cannot <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521" facs="0549"/>only keep the world from exploding; we can create rational
                        relationships that will benefit all of us, eventually even China.</p>
                    <p>In the course of his many questions and comments, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stressed what he called the Soviet Government's
                        desire for better understanding, its inability to fathom U.S. public
                        opinion, its irritation over the fact that we are constantly saying “wait
                        until after the election—and you are always having elections,” its concern
                        over its own internal needs, and its rejection of my “thesis that the
                        U.S.S.R., Cuba or someone else should make all the concessions.”</p>
                    <p>Yet I came away feeling that his concern was genuine. Our reactions to Cuba
                        appear to have surprised him, and he is frankly at a loss how to explain
                        them. He returned to this question again and again.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> politely asked me about my
                        African trip and said he would look forward to a “further discussion” on my
                        return. This occasion, he said, had been most helpful to him in
                        understanding how “you Americans look at things.”</p>

                        which he accepted. He also seemed to accept, although complaining of

                        professed to feel this question nearly resolved and could be finalized in

                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said this was good
                        platform.</p>
                    <p>I replied it is President's platform.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said glad to hear you have
                        this kind platform and we'll do our best to help you fulfill it. You were
                        last here with <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. We have
                        succeeded in doing great deal in time that has passed since. You haven't
                        been here long enough to see all the changes that have been made and even
                        when you were here earlier you didn't see everything because you were
                        flying. I am personally very glad to tell you my feelings about those
                        changes. I worked very close to Stalin here in Moscow and in Ukraine.
                        Stalin's sickness was that he didn't believe anyone and always thought they
                        had secrets from him, so he had secrets from those who were close to him,
                        even from me. He never shared his plans. He regarded his task as leader of
                        party and people as that of prophet. He thought he was only one who could
                        see what was happening and would happen. One day he fell violently upon
                        Mikoyan. I don't remember what the occasion was. He said, “When I die you'll
                        all perish. Imperialists will strangle you.” He underestimated people who
                        worked around him. We had nothing to do with foreign policy. Only he and
                        Molotov handled that. I didn't even see the documents. So when Stalin died
                        it was a very hard time for us. For example, I had never met any foreigners,
                        because this was treason, but contacts are very necessary. When Stalin died
                        it was difficult for us to establish contacts. And we had acute questions
                        before us: Austrian Treaty, Trieste, Japanese Treaty. Most difficult one was
                        Korean war, which had been imposed on us by US. It was very difficult period
                        for us inexperienced people. But we took an initiative to stop Korean war.
                        We established contact with US and Americans understood our purpose and we
                        settled war. True, problem of Korea still remains because foreign troops are
                        still there, but nevertheless there is no shooting.</p>
                    <p>He continued, we decided question of Indo-China. Americans didn't keep their
                        word, and supported <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>. Americans
                        know when to <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0553"/>support nation-wide
                        election and when not to. We liquidated Trieste question. We liquidated our
                        base at Port Arthur, Finnish bases, and Iranian border problem. We thought
                        Americans would follow our good example but they were not so kind as to do
                        so. We've cut our armed forces twofold, but Americans continue increase
                        theirs. We've done much work in agriculture, industry, and housing.</p>
                    <p>After war, Stalin said if we could produce 60 million tons oil and same
                        amount of steel we would have one foot in communism. We will have 185
                        million tons of oil this year and we have 56 and half million tons steel for
                        first nine months this year and will have 67 million tons for all 1962. Your
                        economist Harry Schwartz points out that for one period this year we will
                        have produced same amount of steel as you. In 1961, we built 3.9 million
                        square meters housing. Before revolution Moscow had 11 million square
                        meters, result of 800 years capitalist-feudal structure. And those were
                        wooden houses with poor sewer system. But now we build very solid houses and
                        in one year construct one-third the number of houses as there were in all
                        pre-1917 Moscow. Main thing, however, is that imperialists didn't strangle
                        us.</p>

                        still not perished”. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> added
                        that this is old Polish nationalist slogan. This, then, was prelude to his
                        meeting with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>. This was
                        obviously campaign speech in which President making election promises to get
                        Polish votes. President says US will free Polish people, but Poles freed
                        selves long ago with America. We regret Americans are aggravating tensions
                        between our countries. Such is nature of imperialism.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> asked me inform
                        President that “hooligan overflights” of Soviet ships continue to take place
                        in all seas and demanded “How long will it last?”</p>
                    <p>I said I had had long talk with President before I came<note n="2" xml:id="d250fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> had talked with the

                        communications both ways on subject, but I could add some background to
                        conversation <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had had with
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> and to
                        correspondence.</p>
                    <p>But first I wanted to say it had been very interesting to hear what the
                        Chairman had said and I appreciated particularly his description of
                        differences between Stalin's time and today. As foreigner who served in
                        Moscow during Stalin's time, I could feel difference now and was glad we
                        could talk as we were. While we appreciated their efforts in foreign policy,
                        we believed positive achievements which had been reached had been due to
                        joint effort. US had tried to help in reaching those decisions. I was sure I
                        reflected President's attitude in saying that we compliment Chairman and
                        Soviet people on what they have done to make progress in their economy. We
                        hoped progress made by all peoples would redound to benefit of all mankind
                        in peaceful world.</p>
                    <p>I didn't have text of President's Buffalo speech, so I would reserve comment
                        on this and just say that we have very close feeling for Poland and believe
                        Poles should have had greater freedom of choice. But I was sure President's
                        speech had no provocative intent.</p>
                    <p>On question Chairman had asked re overflights, I had discussed this with
                        President and he wanted me to make following clear (I then read appropriate
                        portion my instructions of Sept 6,<note n="3" xml:id="d250fn3">
                            <ref target="#d233">Document 233</ref>.</note> supplementing from <gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> 864<note n="4" xml:id="d250fn4">See

                    <p>Evidently somewhat taken aback by description of buzzing of Tanner, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> commented he could not say
                        anything about this since he did not have facts. He said it not Soviet
                        policy to create obstacles to navigation on high seas. But Americans do have
                        such a system and engage <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0555"/>in these
                        practices according to system. He was surprised that President was so
                        unaware of this and wanted further evidence about it. When he talked with
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>, President gave
                        orders not to do it. It stopped for a few days, then began again. Now I said
                        US ships had orders not to fire at Soviet ships. We must not shoot at each
                        other, for that would be war. There have been demands by US warships for
                        Soviet ships to stop but he had given orders to them not to submit.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then recounted anecdote
                        about Soviet ship en route to Cuba which US destroyer hailed and asked for
                        destination. Soviet ship continued on way whereupon destroyer demanded it
                        stop. Soviet captain then ordered radioman transmit continuously to US ship:
                        “Peace and friendship”. Destroyer then replied “Peace and friendship” and
                        left Soviet ship alone.</p>
                    <p>I asked when this had happened and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he could give me date and place if I
                        wished.</p>
                    <p>I said I knew President did not want our ships to interfere with navigation
                        and would be interested to know of any incidents in which his orders were
                        not being obeyed.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then produced memo
                        describing alleged incident Sept 23 in Aegean Sea in which Soviet commercial
                        vessel Fryanovo, buzzed by two US navy planes from Carrier No. 65
                        (translation follows <gloss target="#t_SEPTEL1">septel</gloss>).<note n="5" xml:id="d250fn5">Telegram 980 from Moscow, October 16. (Department of

                    </p>
                    <p>I said President would be interested and matter would be investigated.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then spoke
                        circumstantially about incident supposed to have occurred about one month
                        ago in which, after having buzzed Soviet commercial vessel, plane crashed in
                        sea and all aboard drowned, despite rescue attempt by Soviets. When he was
                        asked what should be done about crash, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> ordered his people to wait since Americans
                        usually publish this kind of news. Since nothing was published, it clear
                        this had been military aircraft and news had been concealed from US
                        people.</p>
                    <p>I said such crash could not happen without publication of news and asked if
                        he sure this was American plane.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he knew nothing had
                        been published, since he had followed newspapers, and added he would give us
                        information on incident.</p>
                    <p>I said we could check into it even without details but it would be helpful
                        have these.</p>
                    <p>At this point, <persName corresp="#p_SMN1">Smirnovsky</persName> pointed out
                        that interpreter had not translated sentence from my remarks to effect that
                        some Soviet shipmasters in <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0556"/>their
                        reports might be confusing normal maritime recognition procedures with
                        harassment. Khrushchev said he not aware of norms of recognition at sea, but
                        no nation had right to hinder vessels in international waters. These were
                        not US territorial waters.</p>
                    <p>When he came to New York by ship a few years ago and was greeted by “dogs'
                        concert”, he recognized it was our right stage such greeting since it took
                        place in our territorial waters. But Soviets did not recognize any nation's
                        right to stop Soviet ship on high seas.</p>
                    <p>After again denying we do so, I once more made point that some shipmasters
                        may confuse recognition procedures with harassment.</p>
                    <p>With some heat <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that
                        when planes fly repeatedly over ships and their identification numbers are
                        visible, what kind of recognition was that? These were provocative actions
                        which had nothing to do with good intentions and did not contribute to
                        better relations between our two countries.</p>
                    <p>I said I agreed and President agreed and I would report Chairman's statements
                        to him.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_US1">Udall</persName> made very good impression and
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would give him job <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0557"/>as minister if he did not already
                        have job. Of course, <persName corresp="#p_US1">Udall</persName> represents

                        communist, but this didn't interfere with conversation. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> gave <persName corresp="#p_US1">Udall</persName> film about Soviet electrification and asked him to
                        show it to President. President is very clever at making speeches: he is a
                        “demagogue of great note.” But he didn't mean that in a bad way.</p>
                    <p>I said he probably meant President was a good politician.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> agreed. He said President
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> was not a bad man, but
                        politics was “not his dish.” He still owed President Eisenhower something,
                        because <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had sent him a
                        bull. He had wanted to send <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> a sheep, but then Powers case occurred. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had been on <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> farm and wanted to repay him. He
                        had also received bull from Admiral whose name he couldn't recall.</p>
                    <p>I said it was Admiral Strauss, who had just written interesting book about

                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he was very glad to
                        hear what I had said and he believed President's words. At the time, he had
                        asked his military people and they said weather had been very bad, with
                        result violation could have been unintentional. He then asked what it was
                        that drew us to Soviet borders, saying Soviets do not violate US borders. No
                        doubt it was just the way imperialists acted.</p>
                    <p>I said reason was the same as that which made their trawlers do the same

                    <p>I agreed but said that this was electronic age and both sides apparently
                        liked to listen to electronic emission.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> asked whether we should
                        dig ourselves deeper into ground and just sit there.</p>
                    <p>I said no, but we should use good judgment and that is what President wants
                        to do.</p>
                    <p>Reverting to Cuba, <hi rend="italic">Khrushchev</hi> said he wished to assure
                        President that port regarding which Soviets had signed agreement was just
                        fishing port. “I give you my word.” He said he would reveal a state secret.
                        While he was away, they had signed agreement without consulting him. When
                            <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530" facs="0558"/>he came back he cursed them and
                        said they should have waited until after US elections. Japanese fish off
                        Brazil and have a base there where fish are processed. Cubans couldn't build
                        port themselves so Soviets decided to help them. But agreement had been
                        signed at wrong time. If they had asked him, he would have said sign it
                        November 10 or 15, because he knew it would provide fuel to Republicans who
                        are frying President at the moment. Since Soviets value good relations with
                        President, they could have waited to sign. (<persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> changed “signed” to “published” when interpreter
                        translated this.)</p>
                    <p>I thanked him for these remarks and said I thought President would be glad to
                        hear them.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said perhaps President
                        would think he had concluded this agreement on purpose just to “put a little
                        salt on his wounds.”</p>
                    <p>I said I believed President was a little surprised.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said, “and rightfully so,”
                        adding that when Soviets do a silly thing they recognize it as such, but
                        Americans don't.</p>
                    <p>I said I thought President had been very frank about a couple of matters at
                        Vienna.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that was right.
                        Soviets were formulating agreement right now to send ten to fifteen fishing
                        boats to Cuba. Cubans were having trouble with sugar cane harvest. In past,
                        US had sent Cuba dried cod fish but had now stopped shipments. So Soviets
                        had to help Cubans get fish to feed their people. There were no electronics
                        involved, just plain fishing boats.</p>
                    <p>I said I took good note of his statement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said there were other
                        basic problems still confronting our two countries. One was
                        nuclear-test-ban. We are now very close on this issue. Only problem is that
                        of underground tests. Soviets didn't want these to continue since they were
                        source of arms race. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is on even basis
                        with US on underground testing. We should agree on proposals of English
                        scientists. But President wants inspection, which Soviets will never accept.
                        This is invention of American imperialists and monopolists. Soviets had
                        arranged underground tests which US had detected and announced next day. So
                        national means are clearly enough to detect underground tests.</p>
                    <p>I said I was familiar with (recent exchanges) on this subject, but wished to
                        read to Chairman what I had written down after talking to President. (I then
                        read applicable section instructions.) I said I might just add that we on
                        our side, President, Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName>, and all concerned, had done our best to recognize
                        their sensibilities and to reduce possibility they might view inspection as
                        espionage. While unmanned seismic stations had greatly improved chances of
                        detecting explosions or what seemed like explosions, there was nothing of
                        which we knew that would <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0559"/>replace a
                        certain measure of inspection to determine whether certain events in
                        particular were tests or natural events.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said statement by American
                        scientists published two days ago admitted there were means to verify
                        this.</p>
                    <p>I said I thought this was an inaccurate statement. We had looked at all
                        possibilities and were convinced no means existed to determine nature of
                        event. Fact that event has occurred can be determined, but inspection is
                        needed to establish what kind of event it was. Number of cases in which
                        inspection would be necessary would probably be infinitesimally small, but
                        in those cases it would be necessary. Such inspection would also be helpful
                        to USSR, since our scientists say there must be inspection to establish
                        nature of event. I personally had no doubt that, if <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> said it would not test, then it would not. But there must
                        be provision for objective observers to determine whether events were
                        natural or not, or doubts would remain in rest of world.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said there were various
                        points of view on that question and that is why there is no agreement. But
                        Soviets had found out that there are means to determine nature of event
                        without inspection. It was situation in Congress which prevented President
                        from moving on this subject; he can't convince Congress to agree and
                        consequently holds on to argument about inspection.</p>
                    <p>I said Congress represents public opinion. Difference between us is now so
                        small, President hopes we can come to agreement. But agreement must be
                        ratified by Congress and Congressional opinion represents US public opinion.
                        We had made every effort to reduce this so it would not be a problem for
                        Soviets and President really hopes for agreement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> asked for my evaluation of
                        elections.</p>
                    <p>I said nobody quite knew how they would go. Normally, administration in power
                        tends to lose some votes in off-year elections and this is not regarded by
                        anyone as a disaster. Latest polls I had seen showed chances about even, but
                        should be remembered that Democrats already have big majority in
                        Congress.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that was so, but they
                        didn't support President.</p>
                    <p>I said they didn't always, but much of his program had gone through.</p>

                    <p>1. While <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> slightly qualified
                        his remarks on visit to USA, fact that he returned to subject twice on his
                        own initiative, fact he already has agenda in mind, and manner of speaking
                        made clear to both Davies and me that he has as of now made basic decision
                        to make the trip.</p>
                    <p>2. I plan to see Kuznetzov next week to follow-up on some lesser matters of
                        bilateral interest, at which time I shall express our interest in knowing as
                        far in advance as possible development of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s plans.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is thinner than I
                        remember him from visit to USA. However, he had some color from his recent
                        travels in the central Asian country-side and looked to be in good health.
                        His speech was restrained even when he was voicing standard polemical
                        anti-“imperialist” themes, and these were relieved by occasional banter or
                        roguish expressions which seemed to assure I would not take his words too
                        seriously.</p>

                            Berlin, the President emphasized that the U.S. was anxious to work out
                            mutually satisfactory procedures on Western access to Berlin. However,
                            the greatest concern was Soviet insistence on the withdrawal of Western
                            forces from the city. For text of the memorandum of conversation, see

                            ways and means of continuing the build-up of nuclear weapons.” The
                            President responded that the “US had sought a test ban agreement for a
                            long time and it wished to end tests.” But “the problem today was a
                            technical one, because there was no assurance that underground tests
                            would not be carried out while the treaty was in force unless there was
                            some means of verification.” For text of the memorandum of conversation,

                        ideology were not a barrier to peaceful coexistence and peace. As Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had stated, Americans
                        and the Soviet people were different from the standpoint of ideology; the US
                        was capitalist, and the Soviet attitude toward capitalism was well-known.
                        The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was socialist and it was building
                        Communism. The question of who would win must not be resolved by force but
                        by peaceful competition, and the Soviet Union had adhered to this principle
                        ever since Lenin's days. The Soviet Union was against the use of arms in
                        resolving ideological differences. Competition in the economic field and <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0562"/>in the satisfaction of spiritual
                        and material needs of the people was a domain where the question of which
                        system would gain the upper hand must be resolved. He said that he wished to
                        reaffirm these views on behalf of the Soviet Government.</p>
                    <p>Toward the very end of the conversation, after having touched upon the
                        possibility of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        visiting the United States, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he wished to thank the President for this
                        opportunity of discussing with him questions of interest to our two states,
                        since those questions related to very important aspects of the foreign
                        policies of the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> respectively.
                        The Soviet Government had always believed that it would be a historical
                        achievement if the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> found
                        common language on these questions.</p>
                    <p>The President said he agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s last point. As he had said in Vienna, the US was a
                        large country, and the Soviet Union was also a large country. Both had many
                        things to do at home. As to the outcome of the competition between the two
                        systems, history would be the judge. The President emphasized that neither
                        he nor Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> must take
                        actions leading to a confrontation of our two countries. He said that since
                        he had assumed the office of President, the US had attempted to adjust
                            US/<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations. Laos had been a
                        success so far, but there had been no success with respect to Germany and
                        West Berlin until now. What was inexplicable in the light of what he had
                        thought to be Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        understanding of the United States was what now happened in Cuba since July.
                        Since Laos, that particular situation had been the most serious one.
                        Finally, the President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to convey to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> his appreciation of the opportunity Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had given Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> and other American visitors to meet
                        with him and have discussions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> concluded his conversation
                        with the President asserting that the Soviet Union's policy had been and
                        still was aimed at strengthening peace and eliminating international
                        differences, first and foremost the differences existing between the US and
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; Soviet policy was aimed at living
                        in peace and friendship with the United States. This applied to Cuba as
                        well; after all it was not the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> that
                        had invented this problem. It also applied to the question of a German peace
                        treaty and the normalization of the West Berlin situation on the basis of
                        such a treaty, as well as to other questions on which there was no common
                        language between the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He
                        said he would of course convey the President's remarks to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and that he was sure that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would be happy to
                        receive them.</p>
                    <p>The meeting ended at 7:20 p.m.</p>

                            Succession</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>At age 68 <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is still in
                        generally good health, but advancing years and the rigors of high office
                        have begun to slow him down. The time may not be far distant when death or
                        physical incapacitation removes him from the political scene. Almost
                        inevitably direction of the nation's affairs will then be assumed by an
                        interregnum “collective leadership” composed of the remaining members of the
                        party presidium and secretariat. The Soviet system contains no built-in
                        machinery for ensuring the orderly transfer of power; when the top leader
                        goes, a power vacuum is created, and collectivity provides the facade of
                        unity behind which the fight for the post of party first secretary is
                        waged.</p>
                    <p>Like Lenin and Stalin, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has
                        made no attempt to devise a permanent solution to the succession problem; he
                        has merely designated his favorite in advance. As early as 1959—in an
                        interview with <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Averell Harriman</persName>—he
                        revealed that he and <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> had
                        decided upon <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Frol Kozlov</persName>, now 54, as
                        the man who would eventually succeed to power. <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName>'s status as heir apparent was first publicly
                        acknowledged in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> last October; in
                        the official listing of the party secretariat elected following the 22nd
                        party congress, his name appeared second to that of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and out of the customary
                        alphabetical order, thus formalizing his position as second-in-command. What
                        little is known about <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName> suggests
                        that he would adhere essentially to the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> line, but probably with increased emphasis on
                        control rather than incentive.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName>'s designation as heir comes
                        with no guarantees, however. It is not binding on his peers, and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> can always change his mind. More
                        important, among the shrewd and ambitious men who make the inner circle of
                        leaders, there is bound to be at least one who regards himself as better
                        qualified and with a better chance of winning. Once another hat is tossed
                        into the ring, the power struggle is on.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Emergence of the New Leader</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Ultimately, the victory will go to that member of the hierarchy who succeeds
                        in establishing personal domination over the Communist Party, the single
                        cohesive political force in Soviet society. It tolerates no <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0564"/>rivals, and no organization or group of any
                        kind is permitted to exist outside its control. Thus, he who runs the party
                        runs the country, without constitutional or other legal restraints.</p>
                    <p>However, since no single member of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s coterie appears politically strong enough to
                        step immediately into the dictator's shoes, the new leader must establish a
                        position of pre-eminence among his colleagues in the presidium and
                        secretariat, and he must circumscribe and then reduce the influence of
                        possible rivals in those bodies. In the process, it will not suffice for him
                        to argue his own merits and to espouse policy positions to which his
                        associates can accommodate. Very few of them can be expected to pledge their
                        support without some kind of commitment in return.</p>
                    <p>Gaining the support of the members of the secretariat will be particularly
                        important. Through the staff departments of the central committee, they
                        control personnel appointments at all levels of the party and government.
                        From the outset, the future dictator must seek to secure as many key
                        positions as possible for members of his personal following and to see to it
                        that no posts of consequence fall to his opponents.</p>
                    <p>Heads of other elements in the power structure will also have to be won over.
                        For example, bearing in mind that the Soviet military high command sided
                        with Khrushchev in his 1955 polemic with Malenkov—the advocate of increased
                        consumers' goods production—the new leader will seek the support
                        particularly of those marshals who are central committee members. In order
                        to ensure that they do not become disenchanted and side with his opponents,
                        he will be likely to advocate a strong military establishment and the high
                        budgetary appropriations involved.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, he will identify himself with a high living stand-ard and
                        will give vague promises of improvements in the welfare of the consumer.
                        While he gives public indications of his intent to continue the
                        “liberalization” begun under <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, he may be privately assuring the secret police
                        that there will be no inroads on their powers and prerogatives.</p>
                    <p>Once he has engineered his “election” as party first secretary, the emergent
                        new leader begins the task of transforming his leadership of the coalition
                        into leadership of the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>For the most part he will accomplish the job by continuing to exercise
                        leadership in the presidium. In the period immediately following his
                        election as first secretary, he must consistently win a majority of that
                        body to his point of view on policy positions. Success in the presidium
                        would increasingly establish his authority in the lower party echelons. With
                        the passage of time, the working level would, by and large, accept the fact
                        of his predominance and fall into line behind him.</p>
                    <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0565"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Role of Central Committee</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The central committee normally has no life of its own except at its periodic
                        plenary sessions, and these are usually devoted to speeches approving
                        decisions made in advance by the top leaders. However, by basing his
                        authority largely on control of a majority in the central committee and by
                        using that control to defeat his opponents in 1957, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in effect institutionalized the
                        central committee as one of the principal bases of political strength. Its
                        very real potential for intervening in power struggles makes it imperative
                        that the would-be dictator build up support among its members as soon as
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>To judge from the composition of the central party bodies elected by the 22nd
                        congress, however, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        lieutenants have had little success in maneuvering their allies into key
                        slots. Very few of those elected for the first time have discernible ties to
                        any of the current leaders. The only change was an increase in the number of
                        members associated with the Leningrad party organization, which <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName> headed for several years. Presumably
                        these are men upon whom he can draw for support, but their number—along with
                        the old Leningraders in the central committee—is still too small to give him
                        a decisive advantage.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName> clearly cannot now take steps
                        toward achieving domination of the party without a green light from
                        Khrushchev. The latter, who once boasted that he would run the party as long
                        as he lived, shows no signs of allowing <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName> to start building a personal political machine.
                        Indeed the only top-level personnel shift since the congress apparently
                        worked to <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName>'s disadvantage; the
                        reasons for the removal of Ivan Spiridonov both from the central party
                        secretariat and as Leningrad party boss last April have never become clear,
                        but intentionally or not, his downfall very likely cost <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName> a well-placed ally. The effect of
                        the move—if any—on <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName>'s status as
                        successor-designate is still not known but it must certainly have forced him
                        to take a hard look at those presidium members who—both individually and as
                        a body—will play vital roles in the succession. He must gauge their
                        willingness to accept his claim on the first secretaryship, seek their
                        support, and at the same time identify and assess the strength of those who
                        might contend against him.</p>

                    <p>If past performance is any indication, First Deputy Premier Anastas <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> will be primarily concerned with
                        maintaining his present position in the hierarchy. Both his Armenian
                        nationality and his age—he is 66—argue against an attempt to grab the top
                        job. His activities will nevertheless bear close watching. He has survived
                        nearly 30 years of purges <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0566"/>and other
                        crises in the leadership largely because of his ability to perceive the
                        realities of Kremlin politics—as he did by lining up with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> against the anti-party group.
                        Thus, any sign of a change in his attitude toward <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName> would suggest that his political
                        intuition is again at work, and could foreshadow a fight in which the
                        advantage has shifted away from the successor-designate.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>, the Soviet “president,”
                        must be considered a potential candidate for the top job. Since 1938, he has
                        been a regional party secretary in the Ukraine, high-ranking army political
                        officer, party boss of Moldavia and Kazakhstan, chief of the navy's
                        political directorate, and central party secretary for industrial,
                        transport, military, and police affairs. This experience has very likely
                        left him a long line of well-placed friends from whom he could ask political
                        favors.</p>
                    <p>As a presidium member, <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> has a
                        direct voice in the formulation of Soviet policy, but his “election” as
                        titular chief of state in May 1960—to replace Voroshilov—deprived him of the
                        vantage point he enjoyed as a central committee secretary. The Soviet
                        presidency is basically a sinecure and has traditionally proved a poor
                        political springboard. In contrast to his predecessor, however, <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> has brought some authority to the
                        job and has used it mainly as a vehicle for expounding Moscow's foreign
                        policy line. Contrary to frequent press speculation, there is little
                        evidence to suggest that Mikhail Suslov is now or could become the rallying
                        point for a “Stalinist” faction. A central party secretary since 1947—longer
                        than Khrushchev himself—he has been concerned primarily with ideology and
                        relations with foreign Communist parties. Since Stalin's death and
                        particularly since the 20th party congress, he has concentrated on building
                        a framework of Marxist-Leninist respectability around Khrushchev's policies,
                        and he sided with Khrushchev against the anti-party (and pro-Stalin) group.
                        To judge from his past performance Suslov does not measure up as a Stalinist
                        diehard; on the other hand, he is not a simon-pure Khrushchev man, and on
                        occasion the two may have disagreed over various aspects of Soviet policy.
                        The future leader will very likely expect of <persName corresp="#p_SMA1">Suslov</persName> the same service he now renders as doctrinal
                        apologist for the regime. Like Mikoyan, Suslov has never evinced a desire
                        for more power, and because he deals in political intangibles, he has not
                        had these opportunities to cultivate a personal following normally available
                        to a central committee secretary.</p>
                    <p>Of the senior presidium members, only First Deputy Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Aleksey Kosygin</persName> would appear to have no
                        chance of becoming party first secretary, but he is likely to occupy a high
                        position in any post-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        administration. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> is perhaps
                        the top member of the Soviet managerial elite, and with the exception of the
                        two years immediately after <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0567"/>Stalin's death, has been a deputy premier continuously since 1940. He has
                        never held a full-time job in the party's apparatus, having come up through
                        the administrative and planning departments of the economic bureaucracy.
                        Since it is doubtful that Khrushchev's successor will be strong enough, at
                        least in the early days, to take on both the party first secretaryship and
                        the premiership, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> might become
                        head of the government when Khrushchev leaves the scene.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The Younger Leaders</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>There is always the possibility that a dark horse could emerge. Their brevity
                        of service at the top would seem to militate against a power bid by Dmitry
                        Polyansky, Gennady Voronov, or Andrey Kirilenko, the three newest members of
                        the presidium. Yet each of them has considerable influence and prestige in
                        his own right, and during the course of a prolonged succession crisis, one
                        of them might be able to maneuver himself into a commanding power position.
                        Of the four central committee secretaries who are not presidium members,
                        Aleksandr Shelepin would seem best able to rise to the top. His long service
                        as head of the Komsomol—the young Communist league—may have given him
                        considerable influence among the younger party generation. However, perhaps
                        to his disadvantage, he is tainted by past association with the Soviet
                        secret police (KGB) which he headed from 1958 to 1961.</p>
                    <p>Shelepin's current duties apparently involve party supervision of the police
                        and judicial apparatus as well as some responsibilities for industry, and
                        his support will thus be invaluable to those who do contend. The future
                        leader will need control of the KGB not only because of its coercive power,
                        but also because of its unique ability to keep him informed of what is going
                        on in the party, and particularly among possible rivals.</p>
                    <p>Shelepin and the other non-presidium secretaries may have been selected with
                        one aspect of the succession problem in mind. The exact division of
                        responsibilities in the secretariat has never become clear, but there is
                        information to suggest that the new members are being groomed to replace
                        some of the senior secretaries.</p>
                    <p>Leonid Ilichev and Boris Ponomarev are concerned with propaganda and
                        agitation, ideology, and relations with foreign parties—fields in which
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMA1">Suslov</persName> and Kuusinen are primarily
                        interested. Their apprenticeships would presumably ensure that, when the
                        time comes, <persName corresp="#p_SMA1">Suslov</persName>'s or Kuusinen's
                        duties could be passed to experienced understudies without any break in the
                        continuity of party policies or methods of operation in these fields.</p>

                        of the party control committee could signify that Shvernik's job is to be
                        taken over by another of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        old Ukrainian associates.</p>
                    <p>Such moves are perhaps indicative of a nagging concern over the future; they
                        certainly appear to be an initial attempt to staff the next administration
                        in advance and thereby help ensure continuation of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s policies. But they fall short
                        of solving the basic problem of the orderly transfer of the dictator's
                        powers, and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has proved
                        unwilling or unable to make any arrangements which guarantee that his
                        authority will carry over to his chosen successor.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Conclusions</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>On balance, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has evidently
                        undertaken to see that his policies will be carried forward by staffing the
                        top leadership with men who are in general agreement with his way of running
                        the country. With the future—and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s personal niche in history—thus probably <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0569"/>regarded as partially provided for,
                        the identity of the new first secretary loses some of its importance. Under
                        these circumstances <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        probably sees no compelling need to determine in advance the outcome of the
                        power struggle which, it seems, must surely come.</p>
                    <p>This struggle, unlike the Stalin succession with its cleavages over basic
                        policies, seems likely to center on personalities and methods of operation.
                        There seems little likelihood of any radical alteration of present policies
                        and programs. The probable composition of the new leadership itself would,
                        for example, seem to argue for this conclusion.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the bulk of the party's professional apparatus is similarly
                        composed of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> men. From
                        conviction and an instinct for self-preservation, they would probably throw
                        their support to whoever seems most likely to continue along the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> line.</p>

                    <p>1023. Policy. At invitation Acting FonMin Kuznetzov, I and four Embassy
                        officers had lunch at Spiridonovka with <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName> and <gloss target="#t_MFA1">MFA</gloss> officers
                        present. Presumably invitation motivated in part by Soviet wish facilitate
                        my establishing contact with <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName>,
                        since his only government position is that of Supreme Soviet Presidium
                        member. For Soviet side, he dominated conversation.</p>
                    <p>During luncheon, discussion was rather general with frequent references on
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName>'s part to impressions he
                        had gained in 1959 visit to United States including repeated references to
                            US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as two great powers which will
                        decide fate of world.</p>
                    <p>Conversation after luncheon in which Kuznetzov, <persName corresp="#p_SMN1">Smirnovsky</persName> and <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>
                        participated included discussion of Berlin, disarmament, and nuclear-test
                        cessation. In response my direct question why much-vaunted “coexistence”
                        theory of Soviet Union is not applicable to Berlin, <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName>, with assistant Kuznetzov, largely
                        re-hashed old arguments about necessity of recognizing changed conditions,
                        that post World War II agreements have outlived usefulness, that neither
                        Soviet Union not <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>
                        <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0570"/>threatens West Berliners, etc.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName> said that “speaking
                        personally” (phrase which he used recurrently during conversation) Berlin
                        was a relatively minor difficulty between our countries, that we should
                        focus on the basic problem of disarmament and first of all cessation of
                        nuclear tests. He pointed out that if resolution of these problems could be
                        obtained, Berlin problem would have disappeared.</p>
                    <p>After expounding on the “most important problem” of disarmament, he quickly
                        shifted into need for early resolution problem of cessation of nuclear
                        tests. He graphically described effect on whole world of continuation of
                        large-scale tests in atmosphere, under-water, and in cosmos, which he
                        described as being 99.99 percent of the problem. Only subsequently, and with
                        some prompting from Kuznetzov, did he get into the question of a moratorium
                        on underground tests as part of the package of agreement on cessation of
                        tests in other three atmospheres. Continued discussion of this question with
                        his heavy emphasis on atmospheric, cosmic and underwater testing, with but
                        slight reference to and in fact deprecating dangers of underground testing,
                        left clear implication that as far as <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName> concerned an agreement could be reached with
                        something less than formal agreed moratorium on underground tests.</p>
                    <p>Throughout three-hour meeting <hi rend="italic">Kozlov</hi> gave impression
                        of great self-confidence and vigorous good health. At one point he referred
                        to himself as the “political deputy” of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Foreign Ministry representatives, whom he
                        inclined jokingly to deprecate, seemed somewhat ill at ease in his presence
                        and somewhat concerned that he might fail to expound government line in
                        questions discussed without deviation.<note n="2" xml:id="d255fn2">Airgram

                        <hi rend="italic">1. Short-Run Effects</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Political—The short-run effects should be very favorable to the US.
                        Unquestionably the US will emerge from this confrontation with increased
                        prestige world-wide. The Soviet action should demonstrate once again the
                        offensive nature of Soviet motivations more clearly than anything we could
                        say. It should also demonstrate that the Soviets are not prepared to risk a
                        decisive military showdown with the US over issues involving the extension
                        of Soviet power. (We should be clear however that this is not to be confused
                        with Soviet lack of willingness to “go to the mat” over an interest vital to
                        Soviet security.) More specifically, short-run political effects should
                        include the following:</p>
                    <p>a. Soviet ability to penetrate Latin America should suffer a reversal, though
                        a base for future penetration may remain in Cuba for some time. Soviet
                        intentions have been unmasked, and Soviet inability to force its will
                        clearly demonstrated. Our problems in assisting Latin America to achieve a
                        higher state of political and economic development will still require all of
                        our best efforts. However, our efforts should be focused on the fundamental
                        nature of the problem, and it is important that we continue to pursue our
                        Latin American country internal programs, along with our broader development
                        programs.</p>
                    <p>b. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should be strengthened. The firmness
                        of the US stand, and perhaps even more importantly the categorical refusal
                        to barter <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> assets for immediate US
                        security interests, should provide assurance of US commitment to the
                        Alliance.</p>
                    <p>c. Our position on Berlin should be greatly strengthened. Our resolute
                        willingness to act in Cuba should result in a complete reassessment by the
                        Soviets as to how far they can safely push US will in general, including
                        Berlin. Similarly it should provide our Allies with fortitude for meeting
                        Soviet threats.</p>
                    <p>d. The effect upon the neutrals is more difficult to estimate, but in general
                        is favorable. It must raise in the minds of many of the neutrals <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0572"/>who may have a pro-Communist leaning a
                        question as to how far they may safely “get in bed” with the Soviets and
                        still protect their own national interests.</p>
                    <p>e. While there is probably very little immediate effect on Soviet Satellite
                        relations, it cannot help but plant the seed of doubt as to Soviet
                        omnipotence. This could have important implications for the future.</p>
                    <p>f. The effect on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> can be beneficial,
                        but this will depend on how we further use our present strong position. It
                        is conceivable that within the Soviet leadership the events of the past
                        several days may be considered so serious a setback that changes may occur
                        in the current Soviet leadership.</p>
                    <p>Military—The military benefits secured as a result of the Soviet backdown are
                        similarly immense. Agreement not to proceed with additional missiles, and to
                        dismantle existing missiles and launch facilities, cancels out the temporary
                        increase in capability vis-a-vis the continued United States, which the
                        Soviets achieved in their short-lived attempt to offset the current US
                        nuclear strategic advantage [sic].</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">2. Long-Run Effects</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Political—An analysis of long-run effects is of course more uncertain.
                        Unquestionably the Soviet defeat will have its impact on Soviet thinking and
                        policymaking. Over the long run, one effect may be to make the Soviets far
                        more responsive to our efforts at finding peaceful solutions to the whole
                        range of world problems. However, and this is an important qualification,
                        this effect is certain to take a considerable period of time. We should not
                        delude ourselves into believing that great and rapid changes will result in
                        Soviet policy. People and governments simply do not and cannot change that
                        quickly, even assuming the stimulus for doing so. Thus while it is useful to
                        explore all avenues of solutions to world problems, such as disarmament, we
                        must not expect quick or easy solutions. We would expect that the US will
                        meet with the usual Soviet criticism, resistance, and negotiatory pressure.
                        In short, we must not slip into euphoria over the successful cover of
                        events, assuming it continues to develop favorably.</p>
                    <p>Military—Viewed in its long-run perspective, the Soviet backdown does not
                        affect the Soviet military position in any important essential other than,
                        of course, the important removal of the missiles from Cuba and awareness in
                        Moscow of US refusal to permit any such venture. It is possible that the
                        effect of these events might be to set in motion a redoubled Soviet effort
                        to close the gap to development by the Soviets of a secure second strike
                        capability.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">3. General Conclusion</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Our over-all preliminary conclusion may be summarized as follows:</p>
                    <p>a. We have in the recent situation gained broad political and military
                        assets, on which we should attempt to capitalize. We have probably gained
                        important, but less definite, long-range benefits.</p>
                    <p>b. In these circumstances, it is vitally important that the US take the
                        initiative in offering to negotiate on major issues between East and West.
                        Without being bellicose in the basis of our new-found strength, nor on the
                        other hand making concessions which would adversely affect our position of
                        strength, we should press for fair but safeguarded solutions to outstanding
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>If we have learned anything from this experience, it is that weakness, even
                        only apparent weakness, invites Soviet transgression. At the same time,
                        firmness in the last analysis will force the Soviets to back away from rash
                        initiatives. We cannot now, nor can we in the future, accept Soviet
                        protestations of “peaceful” coexistence at face value. The words may sound
                        the same, but the meaning is different. Their willingness to cooperate in
                        common endeavors can only be judged by performance. The difficult task for
                        US policy in the future is to strike the correct fine balance between
                        seeking cooperation from a forthcoming posture, while retaining the
                        necessary strength and skepticism to insure ourselves and our friends
                        against future duplicity.</p>

                        between Embassy and Washington, pointing to experience of past week as good
                        example of why it would be desirable for Embassy to have leased teletype
                        wire running to Paris. I pointed out question had been hanging fire for
                        year-and-half and reviewed recent conversations with Ministry on subject. I
                        noted our understanding that it <pb n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0574"/>was
                        technically possible have such link, since at least two Western press
                        agencies in Moscow have leased wires, and pointed to line TASS has out of
                        New York as well as <gloss target="#t_SMUN1">SMUN</gloss> line. I also
                        referred to new legislation which would permit us offer Soviets possibility
                        of radio on reciprocal basis. I said I was not raising radio question in
                        formal way now, but wanted let Soviets know we have this possibility.</p>

                        was now growing gray, but, not having known in advance I would raise it, he
                        had not been able prepare self. He thought there were some technical
                        difficulties. It was difficult for him to say anything about this now,
                        except that he would “look into matter.”</p>

                    <p>Following is a report of a conversation I had today with <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Yuri Zhukov</persName>, Foreign Editor of <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>; <persName corresp="#p_BGN1">Georgi
                            Bolshikov</persName>, Editor of <hi rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Magazine</hi>; Mr. Boglov of
                        Novosty.</p>
                    <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0575"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> opened the conversation by
                        saying that he would be most interested in my giving my observations of the
                        past 10 days. I told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> I
                        would have to speak to him personally and with that proviso I gave him an
                        historical review of US-Soviet relations since January 1961 during the
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> Administration.</p>
                    <p>I said the release of the RB-47 pilots by Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> right after inauguration had
                        been looked upon as a hopeful sign and could lead to the opening of
                        Soviet-US relations. The Vienna meeting, while it produced an impasse on
                        Berlin, had been significant for its agreement on Laos which both the
                        President and the Chairman carried out following their meeting in Vienna. I
                        said that I felt that the Laos agreement had been taken as an indication
                        that the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could
                        reach agreements and could be carried out; that they could strengthen the
                        integrity of contacts between the two countries. I went on to say that in
                        subsequent discussions on Berlin and nuclear testing, while they produced no
                        satisfactory solutions, there was a feeling of integrity of communication
                        and particularly private communication.</p>
                    <p>I then said I would like to review the Cuban situation. The developments of
                        the Cuban situation were highlighted by the fact that in May 1962 when I met
                        with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        <note n="2" xml:id="d258fn2">See <ref target="#d195">Document
                            195</ref>.</note> there had been no discussion of this subject. They had
                        become an issue following the start by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> of sending military materials to Cuba. This, I said,
                        placed an immediate and heavy pressure on the President to do something
                        about this situation. But, I said, the President had withstood this pressure
                        and had made the September statement<note n="3" xml:id="d258fn3">For text of
                            the President's September 4 statement on Cuba, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1962</hi>, pp.
                            369-370.</note> which clearly outlined what the United States considered
                        to be the difference between “defensive” and “offensive” weapons. I said I
                        was not interested in getting to a semantical discussion on this subject but
                        that there was no question that the President's speech should have served as
                        an international warning as to what we considered to be dangerous to our
                        national interest. I pointed out that the political pressure increased after
                        the speech but that the President had still refused to be pushed into any
                        precipitous action regarding Cuba. During this period, I pointed out, the
                            <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> statement was put out in which it
                        was stated that the Soviet Union has sufficient offensive weapons in its own
                        territory so that it would not be required to put offensive weapons on any
                        other land. I said we had received a number of private assurances that the
                        Soviet Union would not place offensive weapons in Cuba. I said the
                        President, in the face of political pressure, maintained his own position
                        and even spoke out against those who urged a harsher policy against Cuba. I
                        said the President was therefore astonished when the evidence <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0576"/>was presented to him which showed that
                        missiles had been placed in Cuba by the Soviet government. I said I did not
                        need to review the events between 22 October to the present time because
                        they were well known.</p>
                    <p>I said there should be no illusion however in anyone's mind that we had not
                        reached a point when we were on the brink of the deadliest of dangers. I
                        said the situation now is very clear. The commitments made by Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> should be carried out
                        swiftly and demonstrably. It was not possible that the United States and the
                        Soviet Union would allow <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> to
                        prevent this. Anything short of swift and demonstrable dismantling of the
                        missile sites in Cuba would let the situation slip back and I further said I
                        didn't think that either the United States or the Soviet Union wanted that
                        to happen.</p>
                    <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0577"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> then reviewed the
                        situation. He said he could not agree with me more when I said that the
                        situation should not be allowed to slip back. At the President's press
                        conference tomorrow,<note n="4" xml:id="d258fn4">The President did not hold
                            a press conference on November 1.</note> he said, there should be no
                        back-down on the President's position on Cuba. He said if the President
                        backed down on this matter, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would be in a very difficult position. He said
                        the President and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        were both in difficult positions. “It is most important to repeat again what
                        has been agreed to,” he said. <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName>
                        said it is all very well for newsmen to get involved in details and
                        interpretation but “the skill of the statesman is not to be involved in
                        details.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> then asked “how do we proceed
                        from here? At Andover our American friends discussed the possibility of a
                        Summit Meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Cousins</persName>
                        <note n="5" xml:id="d258fn5">The Andover Conference of Soviet and American
                            scientists and intellectuals, hosted by Phillip Mosely and Norman
                            Cousins of the American Council on Foreign Relations, was held the last
                            week of October. A memorandum of Mosely's telephone conversation with

                            Central Files, 511.613/10-2962.</note> talked to me and suggested
                        several alternatives. I don't know if these statements represented any
                        official view of the government but this is what Cousins suggested: (1) the
                        possibility of a meeting of the Security Council attended only by heads of
                        state; (2) a meeting between President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>, U
                        Thant <note n="6" xml:id="d258fn6">Acting Secretary General of the United
                            Nations.</note> and a representative of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>.” <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> expressed
                        the view that neither of these suggestions would be very effective.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> said that Cousins then
                        suggested a <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> meeting followed by a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>, U Thant and an <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> representative. <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> said he would like to know what our
                        views were on this subject. Would such a meeting be helpful? What subjects
                        could be discussed? “I do not exclude the possibility of such a meeting to
                        finalize the present agreements.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> said he thought the
                        solution to the Cuban problem would open “the way for settlement of other
                        wider ranging problems.” He said that yesterday he met with Scotty

                        useful at this time and would not yield results; that it might first be
                        better to seek a solution through the Disarmament Committee or perhaps

                        time; I had not had a chance to discuss it during the past week; that I
                        could not tell him anything other than my personal feeling prior to the
                        Cuban outbreak and that was that during discussions of Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s possible visit to the United
                        Nations, I had gotten the feeling around Washington that such a meeting
                        between the President and the Chairman would not be particularly useful at
                        that time for it would put us in a difficult position if they were unable to
                        come to any agreement. This, I pointed out, had been Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s own view when I talked with
                        him in Moscow in May. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName>
                        then dropped the subject of the United Nations and the agenda and said he
                        would take it up with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> who he was seeing next.</p>
                    <p>He made the following additional points:</p>
                    <p>(1) He was concerned about reports circulated, he said, by the State
                        Department that <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> had sent a
                        message to Communists in Latin America to begin acts of sabotage. He said he
                        was concerned about the implication that the blowing up of oil fields in
                        Venezuela had resulted from such a message. He said he was certain that
                            <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> had not sent out such a
                        message and further he wanted to point out that <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> was not the boss of Communists in Latin America and
                        would not give such orders. He said he feared that such talk would again
                        start Latin American countries into taking such actions against Cuba. He
                        said this would be very unfortunate: “the fate of the world is in question
                        here.” He said “let U Thant settle these problems.” He said the solution of
                        the Cuban problem must be “the test of sincerity of both sides.”</p>
                    <p>(2) <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> wanted to know if the
                        President would find it useful to meet with <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Anastas Mikoyan</persName>. If so, <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> could stop in Washington on his way to Havana.</p>
                    <p>(3) He complained bitterly about a movie called We'll Bury You released by
                        Columbia Pictures. He said it was a terribly distorted view of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and an insult to Lenin. He said
                        that if the Soviet Union prepared such a film about President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> the United States would pull its
                        Ambassador out of Moscow. I pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> that unlike the Soviet Union the United States
                        Government does not control communications, <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0578"/>i.e., films. He said he was aware of this but wanted to
                        call it to my attention.</p>
                    <p>(4) <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s statements about
                        Berlin and the United States elections<note n="8" xml:id="d258fn8">See <ref target="#d232">Document 232</ref>.</note> did not mean that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would sign an
                        agreement with East Germany after the election. The Chairman, he said, does
                        not have a desire to move on this problem unilaterally: “We do not want to
                        solve this problem without your participation.” He said that what Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> meant was that we
                        should start active negotiations after the elections with a view of seeking
                        an acceptable solution to the problem.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The only way to test the assumption that the events of the last week have
                        created the potential for a major change in US-Soviet relations and
                        consequently in the international political scene is to act on it. We can
                        act in two directions—Berlin and disarmament. There is reason to believe
                        that these are complementary not competing possibilities.</p>
                    <p>Discussions on both subjects have been going forward and there exist channels
                        for continuing them; however, disarmament discussions have been languishing
                        and Berlin discussions are almost dead. It seems reasonable as a first
                        hypothesis to assume that in order for a useful initiative to be taken, it
                        must be taken in a new channel. A bilateral summit directed at reaching
                        agreements in principle on Berlin and disarmament, to <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0579"/>be followed by foreign ministers' meetings
                        of four powers would seem to be the best way to organize an initiative with
                        a maximum chance of securing big results. The powers involved in the German
                        negotiation include all those that would be required to deal with nuclear
                        test-ban and non-diffusion agreements; if more on the disarmament front is
                        attempted, a wider forum will be necessary. There are two kinds of counter
                        arguments to be made against a bilateral summit. The first is that our
                        allies do not like it. If we assess the probability of a useful outcome as
                        being at all high, we are justified in ignoring this consideration. The
                        other is that the internal turmoil in Moscow is such as to make it unlikely
                        that the Soviets want a bilateral summit now. The assertion of fact upon
                        which this argument rests is probably true; however, the conclusion does not
                        follow. Indeed, it is precisely the existence of turmoil which makes the
                        opportunity for a productive summit. Absent uncertainty and an ongoing
                        prospect of re-evaluation on the Soviets' side, it is unlikely that we would
                        achieve any significant change in the terms on which we confront each other.
                        Further, a Berlin summit properly arranged may indeed be a way of avoiding
                        what must be a most difficult problem for the Soviets in entering into any
                        negotiations at the moment—that of appearing to the rest of the world as
                        bowing to U.S. demands. This argument points up in turn another condition of
                        a successful summit, that we view our situation in relation to the Soviets
                        as symmetrical; namely, that recent events have enabled us both to see with
                        greater clarity where our joint interests lie and how it is in our joint
                        interest to limit occasions of conflict and direct confrontation between us
                        and to reduce the potentiality for any remaining occasions to escalate into
                        general war.</p>
                    <p>On disarmament, the minimum results worthwhile aiming at appear to be a
                        comprehensive test ban treaty, and a nuclear non-diffusion agreement. Some
                        further trimmings could be added to this minimum in a way of an agreement to
                        refrain from putting weapons into outer space and agreement on a list of
                        measures to reduce the dangers of surprise attack. The former appear easy;
                        the latter not particularly significant.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s recent letters to the
                        President suggest that the events have themselves been enough to move the
                        Soviets from their previous position on a comprehensive test ban treaty to
                        an acceptance in principle of inspection, although this is not yet evident
                        in Tsarapkin's<note n="2" xml:id="d259fn2">

                        statements at Geneva. It will be necessary to us, however, to take some
                        risks with respect to the number of control posts and the number of
                        inspections. This is a problem which we have examined fairly carefully, and
                        we have the bases for decision on this.</p>
                    <pb n="552" xml:id="pg_552" facs="0580"/>
                    <p>On Berlin, our problems are more difficult. The course of events has probably
                        caused the Soviets to abandon any plans they have for cutting off allied
                        military access in a drastic way in the near future. If by the immediate
                        threat in Berlin we mean the threat of a sharp enough interference with
                        allied access to lead to a military confrontation, we can then say that the
                        immediate threat has vanished for some (indefinite) time. If, however, we
                        view the existence of even last Summer's degree of tension and uncertainty
                        and the prospect that it might increase at any time as in themselves
                        undesirable, then we can say that the Berlin crisis is still with us.
                        Moreover, the pains in the present situation to the Berliners themselves and
                        the importance of the German problem in intra-European politics, argue that
                        the problem demands a major effort absent a Berlin crisis in the immediate
                        sense.</p>
                    <p>The minimum results we might seek in Berlin would almost certainly require
                        substantial movement by us from our past positions if we are to do more than
                        ratify the status quo in the narrowest sense which we have failed to do in a
                        year-and-a-half of effort. An international access authority with full
                        control, ideally, of an autobahn, a railway line and a canal route, plus
                        operation of the relevant airways, would be our access guarantee. In
                        addition, we must ask for some provisions covering movement of persons, both
                        between East and West Berlin, and East and West Germany. This might well
                        take the form of minimum quotas which can be revised upwards by mutual
                        agreement but not downwards, and with the right to reject specific
                        individuals on the admitting authority of either side. Further, we should
                        seek a clear contractual basis for the presence of western troops. It might
                        be desirable to make West Berlin legally part of the Federal Republic, but
                        subject to certain limitations on the kinds of armaments and the number of
                        troops that can be put into it, on the basis of reciprocal engagements and
                        conditions for East Berlin. This would be useful as a precedent for an arms
                        control agreement. The case against this particular provision in the
                        settlement is the traditional German fear that we would be contracting out
                        of our responsibility for the defense of West Berlin. This is also in large
                        part the case for it. On balance, my judgment leads me to be for it.</p>
                    <p>In order to achieve so much, what must we be prepared to give? At a minimum,
                        enough recognition of the authorities in East Germany to accomplish some of
                        the Soviet purposes. This would certainly include defining the borders of
                        Germany to the east, as well as the sector borders. It would certainly
                        include allowing the East German membership in the access authority. It
                        would include that degree of recognition implied by East German bilateral
                        negotiations with the Federal Republic on a variety of subjects. It could
                        include an explicit declaration that Germany would be unified on the basis
                        of discussion and agreement between the authorities of the two parts of
                        Germany. If we add renunciation of the use <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0581"/>of force to change the boundaries between the two, and
                        mutual declarations of non-aggressive intent between the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Warsaw Pact countries, we have the
                        substance of the 10 points which we never succeeded in selling either to the
                        Germans or to the Soviets last year.</p>
                    <p>The double package of Berlin and disarmament proposals might be negotiable on
                        a bilateral basis. To test its negotiability, however, we would have to take
                        the step of substituting a policy of informing our allies for a policy of
                        consulting them in advance. It is not clear that the week's experience has
                        had a powerful enough effect on the principal ally concerned, the Federal
                        Republic, to warrant the conclusion that we can achieve this result. But
                        here again only the attempt can provide the test.</p>
                    <p>Having gone so far, it may be worthwhile to go much further. Much further in
                        the Berlin direction would involve trading some kind of all-Berlin solution
                        involving neutralization, with either four-power or <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops and guarantee, for explicit recognition of East
                        Germany and a German peace treaty. The treaty would provide for ultimate
                        unification and contain the kinds of provisions described above for movement
                        between the two Germanies and between each Germany and Berlin. To make this
                        offer now would certainly offend the West Germany Government deeply. In my
                        own judgment, the temperature of last week's events was not sustained at a
                        high enough level over a long enough period of time to make this proposal
                        acceptable either to the Russians or the Germans. It might be made more
                        acceptable to the Russians and less acceptable to the Germans by adding to
                        it provisions limiting the number of troops in both Germanies and providing
                        some troop-free zone for a short distance around Berlin and on either side
                        of the boundary between East and West Germany. This would be very difficult
                        for the West Germans to accept unless <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        integration went a great deal further than it has gone to date.</p>
                    <p>On disarmament it is obvious that the step beyond is a first-stage agreement
                        of some sort. Here again the difference between the U.S. and Soviet
                        positions is very substantial. Even if we are prepared to move a good deal
                        in dismantling bases, and speeding up the rate of disarmament in the first
                        stage, we would be very far from the Soviet position, which calls for
                        something like nuclear parity by the end of the first stage. The experience
                        of last week probably reinforces our judgment that we are not now ready for
                        nuclear parity.</p>
                    <p>With disarmament, as with Berlin, the conclusion seems to be that a radical
                        change is unlikely. Thus, the final question is: Is there enough in the
                        limited program in two spheres to justify the risk of summit failure and
                        alliance alienation? This writer votes “yes”, loudly. (Oxymoron?)</p>

                    <p>1227. Policy. Some footnotes to Kremlin reception.</p>
                    <p>1. There seems to me no doubt that events of past 10 days have really shaken
                        Soviet leadership. This seemed clear from remarks by almost every Soviet
                        with whom we spoke, including <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName>,
                        Madame <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, and Air Marshal
                        (who told my wife he was now willing to believe in God), intelligentsia and
                        government functionaries. This seems to me more important, basically, than
                        rumors and speculation about differences within that leadership. There was
                        in fact no evidence of such differences during three hours of reception
                        tonight and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was in
                        command.</p>
                    <p>2. As the press will have reported in detail, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> made three short extemporaneous speeches
                        concluding in toasts: First to Soviet people and building of communism;
                        second to Soviet youth, i.e., the future; and third to “Ambassadors” and
                        peace and friendship among all peoples. In latter he was both agile and
                        restrained, following general line of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s report last night and <persName corresp="#p_MRY1">Malinovsky</persName>'s speech in Red Square this morning.<note n="2" xml:id="d260fn2">For <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s
                            report, see <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi>, November 7, 1962; for Malinovsky's speech, see <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi>,
                            November 8, 1962.</note> Perhaps most striking element now being
                        introduced is extension of definition of “peaceful coexistence” to include
                        concept of the necessity of mutual “concessions” to prevent conflict.</p>
                    <p>3. During first round of exchanges with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, in which all Chiefs of Mission were briefly
                        received, I had recourse to a story which he had told in his own third
                        speech, about two men who had added different numbers to reach same sum. I
                        said that I used different numbers than he to come to same results as
                        regards danger of situation and need to settle differences peacefully. He
                        said total sum was important thing and proposed we toast that.</p>
                    <p>4. Later, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> called me over
                        privately and immediately referred to our conversation about a meeting with
                        the President.<note n="3" xml:id="d260fn3">See <ref target="#d248">Document
                                248</ref>.</note> He said he had been thinking further about this
                        question. He now thought we should not rush into such a meeting. It would
                        probably be better that there should be advance preparation on one or more
                        questions, so that agreement would be in view. Then perhaps the President
                        and he could meet, maybe together with some other heads of government, and
                        register <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0583"/>such agreements. He asked
                        me to convey his greetings to the President.</p>
                    <p>5. Despite the gesture toward Cuba in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s last speech and toast, the Cuban Ambassador was
                        in fact neglected during the proceedings.</p>
                    <p>During the entertainment which followed, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> pointedly brought my wife forward to join him and
                        Madame <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. At the end he
                        again asked me to transmit his message and his regards to the President,
                        which I assured him I would do promptly.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>1. The Cuban crisis is not yet fully resolved, and its further course may
                        involve prolonged and severe tensions. This might lead the Soviets at some
                        point to adopt a generally aggressive stance toward the US, which could
                        affect their behavior on other East-West issues. Nevertheless, it now seems
                        possible to gauge the general outlines of the policies which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> wishes to pursue in other matters of
                        contention, especially on the questions of Berlin and disarmament, in the
                        period immediately ahead.</p>
                    <p>2. The course of the crisis in Cuba has undoubtedly shaken the confidence of
                        the Soviet leaders. They will feel obliged to reassess the validity of their
                        own policies and judgments about their opponents. This process of
                        reassessment will focus mainly on the general Soviet posture toward the
                        West. But this in turn will be influenced by internal Soviet politics, which
                        may already be in a state of division and confusion, and <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0584"/>the status of Bloc relations, particularly
                        the Sino-Soviet conflict which has been notably worsened by Soviet conduct
                        in the Cuban crisis.</p>
                    <p>3. For the immediate future, however, extreme alterations of course in
                        foreign policy seem unlikely. Retaliation is of course appealing, but the
                        mood of the US, the coalescence of support behind the US, and the temper of
                        the uncommitted world all argue strongly against it. There has been no
                        evidence of a Soviet disposition to seek occasions for reprisals, and in
                        fact the official Soviet position—that the outcome is a victory for the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>—puts a little additional weight
                        against this response.</p>
                    <p>4. The chances for an early move toward genuine détente seem even lower.
                        Soviet bargaining power is at a low ebb, and they would conclude that, when
                        the West was under little pressure to make concessions, general settlements
                        could only be at the expense of Soviet interests in such matters as Berlin
                        and disarmament. They will almost certainly wish, as a general principle, to
                        repair the present disarray and find means to restore an image of strength
                        before they are ready to consider any real diplomatic give-and-take.</p>
                    <p>5. Thus the likeliest immediate outlook, in our view, is for a period of
                        reconsolidation masked by verbal activity and propagandistic initiatives.
                        There are opportunities for limited gains in this approach, insofar as the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> can play upon the war fears which
                        heaved up during the crisis, and the general hopes that the superpowers will
                        now have to find a more reasonable way to live with each other. The newly
                        dramatized issue of foreign bases will evidently be employed in this
                        connection. But in general we believe that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will find this a poor time to alter its positions and a
                        good time to talk for talk's sake, especially on such prime issues as
                        disarmament and Berlin.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Disarmament</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>6. There is as yet no evidence to suggest any change in the Soviet position
                        on general disarmament, and some reason to expect that none will soon occur.
                        In the Cuban affair, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has sought to
                        avoid the principle of inspection and to insert in its place the principle
                        of verification of completed disarmament measures, thereby staying in line
                        with its stated position. The less the Soviets want to negotiate seriously,
                        however, the more important they find it to pose as the champions of
                        negotiations. Disarmament has always provided a ready forum for the
                        agitational abuse of diplomacy, and now is a better time than most for
                        reasons suggested above. The foreign base question, the concept of the
                        nuclear-free zone, and an attack upon US surveillance policies all might be
                        expected to find considerable resonance in the post-crisis period. The
                        outlook is therefore for a considerable show of activity in this field which
                        is unlikely, however, to include any substantial changes in Soviet
                        positions.</p>
                    <p>7. A nuclear test ban, however, poses a more immediate problem for Soviet
                        decision. There is some evidence that prior to the Cuban crisis <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0585"/>and during it the Soviets saw this as an
                        issue which could be resolved with minimum concessions. If the Soviet
                        leaders feel that an early move to arrest the arms race and reduce tensions
                        is now necessary, they may be prepared to give serious consideration to
                        ending tests, either in agreement with the US or under a general
                        moratorium.</p>
                    <p>8. Berlin. One of the most notable features of Soviet behavior during the
                        Cuban crisis was the failure to exploit the Berlin problem in any way
                        against the US. The Soviets evidently regarded the Cuban crisis as so
                        dangerous in itself that any move to broaden the confrontation would bring
                        intolerable risks. With the tensions over Cuba reduced the Soviets may
                        believe that they can safely revive the Berlin issue. They may even be
                        stimulated to do so by a sharpened appreciation of the importance of a
                        predominance of power and tactical advantage in the immediate area of
                        contention, these factors being in their favor at Berlin as they were in the
                        US favor over Cuba. Moreover, Berlin would be the most meaningful area for
                        Soviet action if the USSR is seeking a gain to offset its defeat in
                        Cuba.</p>
                    <p>9. On the other hand, the Soviets must recognize that the US has a publicly
                        established and much firmer commitment in Berlin than the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had in Cuba. Thus they are still
                        confronted with the choice of risky unilateral actions and unattractive
                        negotiations. They probably believe that unilateral encroachments would now
                        be more dangerous because the US, having prevailed in Cuba, would be
                        encouraged to take stronger countermeasures. At the same time, the
                        alternative of negotiating for a mutually acceptable compromise is perhaps
                        more difficult for the Soviets than before, because any important
                        concessions would tend to confirm before the whole world that not only in
                        Cuba, but in other questions as well, the Soviets were acting from
                        weakness.</p>
                    <p>10. We believe that the Soviets are likely to reject these extreme
                        alternatives, pending a general re-evaluation of both their own policies and
                        the attitude of the West. Recent public and private statements by Soviet
                        officials, including <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s
                        Bolshevik Anniversary address, suggest no major initiative on the Berlin
                        issue is contemplated at present. As a temporary expedient the Soviets may
                        submerge the Berlin question in the broader negotiations over a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw Pact détente, thus obscuring and
                        rationalizing their refusal to take decisive action. If they follow this
                        line, the Soviets will probably not move toward an early agreement until the
                        general line of their policies is determined.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The Longer Run</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>11. Although the immediate Soviet reaction to the Cuban affair may be an
                        effort to gain time for rebuilding and consolidating, the Cuban crisis poses
                        insistent questions about the future course of Soviet policy. And these
                        questions have become sharper at the very time when economic problems are
                        getting harder to solve and the Sino-Soviet breach widens. <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0586"/>Moreover, this whole constellation of
                        problems must be faced by a leadership which has experienced a serious
                        reverse, and it is difficult to believe that this experience left
                        undisturbed the structure of that leadership and the individual judgments of
                        its members.</p>
                    <p>12. These considerations suggest that 1963 could be a year of unusual
                        importance in the evolution of Soviet policy making. Arguments can be
                        constructed for substantial and even fundamental changes, and while the
                        arguments themselves point in different directions, each of them constitutes
                        a stronger case than could be made a year ago. We should not expect a smooth
                        and massive shift onto a new tack; contradictions seem much more likely. But
                        the contradictions may well be more acute, the policy fluctuations wider,
                        and the implications for the US more far-reaching than we have become
                        accustomed to in the years of “peaceful coexistence.”</p>

                    <p>The Secretary began by saying that the US has no difficulty with paragraphs 1
                        through 7 of the communication from Lord Home.<note n="2" xml:id="d262fn2">A
                            copy of this undated communication is attached to a November 3 letter
                            from <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">Ormsby Gore</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>. (Ibid., Presidential
                            Correspondence: Lot 66 D 204) In the first 7 paragraphs Home analyzed
                            the situation following the Cuban crisis and in the last 4 he offered
                            specific proposals on Berlin.</note> This is <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0587"/>about how we see the situation. It would be a great mistake
                        for any of us to draw general conclusions from the Cuban affair, and the
                        British paper makes this very clear. We had overwhelming conventional
                        capability in the Cuban area, and this is not true in other areas. The big
                        question we must think about is what effect the Cuban crisis will have on
                        Moscow's thinking. The Secretary said that before Cuba he had thought we
                        were in for some bad months ahead. This had not been based on anything very
                        precise. We would suppose that during the Spring the Soviets must have had a
                        review of their policy. They had a lot of problems and had to decide whether
                        they should embark on a period of rather inactive peaceful coexistence, or
                        whether they should press hard. The decision was probably taken to follow
                        the bolder line. We don't really know who drew guns on whom in the Kremlin
                        during the Cuban crisis.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> asked if the Secretary meant that the Soviets
                        had decided to pursue a forward policy, and the missiles in Cuba were a part
                        of this.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said yes, the Soviets must have made their missile decision by
                        the first of July. This was a major operation.</p>
                    <p>All of this may mean, the Secretary continued, that the Soviets will now go
                        in for a crash program in building up their nuclear strength. Had the Cuban
                        venture worked, it would have achieved some of this at a cheap price. But
                        the Soviets may well now take a breather before their crash program. They
                        might go in for a thoughtful reassessment, tidying up here and there, seeing
                        what they can do, but not making too great an effort. Or they might decide
                        that this is a more dangerous world than they had thought and consequently
                        be more serious about disarmament and settling various questions. We just
                        don't know what they will do, but it would be a great mistake to assume that
                        they are routed. It is very important that the Chancellor not feel that now
                        is the time to push the Soviets into a corner. We wonder how much margin
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has left. He may have
                        used up a good deal of his political capital, and we should not try to “rub
                        his nose in it” at this time. Whether the Soviets are going into a crash
                        buildup or into a period of reflection, they might be more disposed toward a
                        modus vivendi on Berlin along the lines of the “principles paper.”<note n="3" xml:id="d262fn3">For text of the Principles Paper, see <ref target="frus1961-63v15">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961-1963, vol. XV</ref>,
                            pp. 69-71.</note> They might be interested in a pause—a further
                        delay.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> said there was some difference between an
                        actual modus vivendi and a pause. A pause might not be too good for the
                        West. The British prefer an actual modus vivendi.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he did not wish to exaggerate what would be changed by a
                        Soviet crash buildup. They would have to have an almost unbelievable
                        first-strike capability. The present situation almost passes rationality in
                        terms of the damage both sides can inflict. The Cuban affair <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0588"/>must have disturbed the Soviets' thought
                        that we are too sane to go to war. The predictors of US reaction in the
                        Kremlin must be confused by this episode, and this may be all to the
                        good.</p>
                    <p>At the moment, the Secretary continued, he did not see any Berlin settlement
                        that would be acceptable to the West and that would appear to be acceptable
                        to the Soviets. We ought to look hard to see if such a settlement might be
                        worked out. The Germans may have some new ideas. But if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has really passed a divide in
                        Soviet policy and has won out in not really risking war, there may possibly
                        be some chance of a settlement giving us what we need and leaving him free
                        to sign his treaty.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> said that the British paper dealt with the
                        situation where the Soviets had raised the Berlin issue. The British wonder
                        if there is anything we can now do to influence the Kremlin to make the
                        right decision.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we would like to find points where this is possible,
                        and disarmament is high on the list. Cuba was basically a part of the arms
                        race and an excellent example of what can happen if it goes on. We don't
                        know whether we can get anywhere on nuclear testing. Maybe we can get
                        somewhere if we can make on-site inspection invitational. We would have to
                        be the judge of unreasonable refusal. We could not run any risk.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> said a distinction should be made between a
                        policy to encourage <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and
                        the kind of policy that should be followed if it is discovered he has taken
                        up the right option. Some of what is in the British paper assumes that
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will come to the
                        decision to attempt real coexistence and might wish to reach a modus
                        vivendi. The question is how we can save his face. This might be more easily
                        done in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw Pact context.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the US in the public exchanges on Cuba had used very
                        general language concerning <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw
                        Pact arrangements. One thing we can now expect is a lot of political and
                        propaganda effort against foreign bases. We are in for a real battle on
                        this. If <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is looking for a
                        way to put Berlin on ice, this should not be too difficult. We could use the
                        modus vivendi approach.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> agreed but asked whether this should be done
                        simply in the Berlin context.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said the “principles paper” provides a much broader context.
                        The US would be glad to have further Foreign Office thoughts on further
                        revisions of the “principles paper.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he wished to give Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> the
                        latest information on Cuba. The best judgment of the US is that the Soviets
                        have made a real effort to remove the missiles, but we still have the
                        problems of the bombers and on-site verification. It may be that <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> is the problem, but if the Soviets
                        insist, he would have no other choice. Our problem is that we <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0589"/>cannot settle just for the missiles. We
                        must get the bombers out and have verification.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> asked if this verification must continue
                        forever or be for a limited time.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said we must have assurance for a considerable period of time
                        that this venture is not going to be repeated. Air surveillance can
                        accomplish a certain amount. Perhaps the Brazilian proposal for an atom-free
                        Latin America<note n="4" xml:id="d262fn4">For text of the Brazilian
                            proposal, first submitted on September 20, see U.N. doc.
                            A/C.1/L-312.</note> opens the way. One reason that verification is
                        necessary is that if the deception is repeated, it will be hard to avoid
                        war. We have the impression that <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> is trying to get <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> to go along with the
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> agreement.<note n="5" xml:id="d262fn5">For

                    </p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> said that otherwise it would be hard to
                        explain the length of time <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> is
                        spending in Havana.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said we had had a report yesterday from a Soviet member of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretariat to the effect that the
                        Soviets would take the bombers out of Cuba but would then embark on an
                        intensive campaign against US bases everywhere. Our impression is that the
                        Soviets wish to leave Berlin lying there. There is danger in thinking we
                        have to rush to please <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> said the question is whether there is now an
                        opportunity to make Europe less explosive. We should look at the disarmament
                        side. The messages exchanged indicated that we would. This could be kept
                        separate from Berlin or Central Europe. Sir David said his impression was
                        that the Secretary thought we should wait awhile.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said “Yes.”</p>
                    <p>He said he had been giving further thought to convincing <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> that we must have available to us in a
                        crisis the maximum range of possibilities. We must pay attention to our
                        conventional forces. We must avoid having to make a choice between a nuclear
                        response or capitulation.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he was also a little more impressed with the necessity of
                        trying to create a pause in a crisis. This had been critical in the Cuban
                        crisis. It had been felt that the Soviets had to be given a period of time
                        in which to rectify their mistake.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> said his impression was that London was
                        wondering whether a broad East-West exchange should now take place into
                        which Berlin would be subsumed. This might include surprise attack, war by
                        miscalculation, nonproliferation, etc. Within this general exchange we might
                        find that the Soviets were prepared to leave Berlin alone. The Soviets could
                        say that all the other arrangements had lessened the dangers of <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0590"/>war. Sir David asked whether this was a
                        good approach—whether we should leave Berlin to stew for a while and turn to
                        disarmament.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that this gets involved in the question of freezing the
                        status quo. Unless the Soviets abandon their doctrine of world revolution,
                        any <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw Pact nonaggression treaty
                        would be very unilateral indeed. They would go ahead and do what they want,
                        and we would be fixed. It would turn out to be a very lopsided arrangement.
                        The Secretary added that he really didn't see yet that the Soviets were
                        ready to abandon their theory of world revolution.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> agreed but said they could practice this
                        theory in two ways—play it long, or take risks.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he believed the Soviets were losing faith in the
                        inevitable triumph of Communism, and this might make them turn to a more
                        active program.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> said they could play it either way.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said there had been times in which he had thought <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might be appealed to as being
                        the man who really built up Russia, but every so often he was reminded that
                        Khrushchev was really an old Bolshevik. Cuba had set things back a long
                        way.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> said the British wondered how we could set
                        about finding out what kind of a disarmament package might be possible. In
                        view of the total lack of confidence on both sides, no one really believed
                        in disarmament. Cuba makes strict verification and control necessary. It is
                        probable that we can make progress only on collateral measures such as the
                        test ban, nonproliferation, and perhaps outer space. The Soviets might be
                        interested in this field. If so, how do we discover what they are interested
                        in? It might be far more sensible to have a private US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> discussion.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said this was possible, but it would be extremely uncomfortable
                        for the US if our friends were sitting on the sidelines not giving us their
                        confidence. In this connection he had in mind the Germans, the French, and
                        others.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> agreed. He added that he supposed the
                        Secretary would be talking to the Germans about nonproliferation.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he would be talking to Schroeder about this. The German
                        anxiety, he added, was not so much concerned with the Soviet Union but with
                        their prestige vis-a-vis the British and the French.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> said when it came to the test ban the Russians
                        would not come forward unless there were some indication that the French
                        were prepared to come along.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that outer space could be taken care of by a common
                            US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> declaration.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> said this might be an example of East-West
                        agreement with verification on both sides.</p>
                    <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0591"/>
                    <p>The Secretary said if we could give the Soviets full knowledge of our
                        information concerning them, they would be a little surprised. We could say
                        that the Soviets could forget about their obsession with secrecy because we
                        already know so much.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> said we must remember the 1959 agreement of
                        the Soviets to inspection.<note n="6" xml:id="d262fn6">For text of the
                            Soviet proposal on inspection, see U.N. doc. A/4078 (S/4145), Annex 12,
                            January 5, 1959.</note> The wheel might turn again. The thing the
                        Soviets probably fear most is Westerners bringing back stories about the
                        level of the standard of living in the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said the Soviets may underestimate our knowledge and
                        overestimate the value of secrecy.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> said he took it that the Secretary was not too
                        happy about sounding out the Russians as to the question of in what areas
                        progress might be made concerning collateral measures.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said this was certain to occur, but it was an uncomfortable
                        position.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> asked how the French might be brought in.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he didn't know whether there was any possibility of doing
                        so.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> said much would depend on
                        the results of the French elections.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that personally he would think it might be advisable to
                        have a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw Pact military center
                        where strange phenomena could be checked as to their meaning—movements of
                        troops, radar blips, etc. This could not do any damage, and it might perhaps
                        do some good.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> said that the two big questions were: 1) what
                        the Russians are interested in; and 2) how do we involve our most important
                        allies.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that one thing the British could help with would be to
                        find a way to make it clear to Europe that what the British would like to
                        see is a special relationship between a united Europe and the US—not just
                        between the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the US. This matter is
                        much in the French, German and Italian minds. The whole sense of a special
                        relationship is a very dangerous thing.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> said this was one problem in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> getting into the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said at some time the American people were going to become very
                        sensitive to the notion that we are the gendarmes of the universe, and that
                        the scale of our commitment in Europe is disproportionate to Europe's
                        commitment. This is something Europe can correct. It does not make sense for
                        the US to provide both the nuclear and the conventional support.</p>
                    <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0592"/>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> said that he would like to go back to
                        procedure on the disarmament side. If <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> goes on talking to <persName corresp="#p_DAH1">Dean</persName>, will we have any clear idea of what the Soviets wish
                        to raise? We should come to some conclusions as to who should talk to the
                        Russians.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we will get back to Geneva this month, and this would
                        be the best place for this discussion.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> asked if the US had thought of conducting
                        discussions on some other level.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that we do not wish to get much involved in other
                        questions until Cuba is settled. But once Cuba is settled, we would wish to
                        check with the Soviets on a number of things on which we might make headway.
                        But the procedures would be the normal ones, Geneva on disarmament, possibly
                        one or two more bilateral talks on Berlin, etc.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> said the British were wondering if this were
                        the right approach. They were wondering whether there should not perhaps be
                        a high level US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> exchange to see in
                        what areas progress could be made.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he was afraid that a certain untidiness in these soundings
                        was inevitable. Otherwise we would have a terrible problem with our
                        allies.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> said there would be no problem with the
                        British.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said no, but there would be with the others, and we did not
                        wish to raise these problems with our allies. He realized that this was not
                        a good time for the British to take on General de Gaulle. Perhaps we could
                        get the Germans to get the French to occupy some of the chairs they had left
                        empty.</p>
                    <p>Turning back to Lord Home's communication, the Secretary said he was very
                        pleased to see that our general assessments of the post-Cuba situation were
                        very similar.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> said he took it that on Berlin the US would
                        like more time.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that if London has more ideas concerning a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw Pact arrangement, the US would
                        like to hear them. If the fact is that we remain in Berlin, we could look at
                        various theories as to how we might remain.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> said he understood that at the moment the
                        Secretary would not think we should press the Russians on Berlin if they
                        were prepared to let it alone.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said we must not rush to be nice to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. He is really out to cut our throats, but on the
                        other hand we don't want to push him into a corner.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_OGSD1">David</persName> said perhaps we had more time than the British
                        paper indicated.</p>
                    <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0593"/>
                    <p>The Secretary said at the moment there were two very big gaps: 1) what would
                        happen in the <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> meetings; and 2) what would happen
                        concerning the bombers. If these fall into place, other questions could be
                        taken up. If it seems clear that the Soviets have performed and <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> stands in the way and we must,
                        therefore, turn our attention to <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>, we are really going to need help in putting pressure
                        on him. This does not mean shooting but maximum political and economic
                        pressure, and if it comes to this we will need much assistance from our
                        friends in this hemisphere and in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>

                        headings.</p>
                    <p>2. Track A includes proposals largely staffed out within the US Government
                        and generally familiar to our Allies and—in many cases—the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, some or all of which might form the
                        subject of negotiation.</p>
                    <p>(a) Bilateral co-operation: Signing of civil air agreement, implementation of
                        Laos agreement, US-Soviet co-operation in the health field, agreement on
                        limited measures to strengthen the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and

                    <p>(b) Arms control: Safeguards against miscalculation (direct communication
                        facilities, exchange of military missions, advance notification of military
                        movements, joint military-technical study group); Latin American and African

                    <p>3. Track B includes more radical proposals:</p>
                    <p>(a) Expanded Berlin/Germany Proposal. This would involve an improved position
                        for Berlin via either (i) an all-Berlin solution, or (ii) more secure
                        non-Communist control of access to West Berlin and a change in juridical
                        status of West Berlin which provides for continuation of the present Western
                        military presence. For Germany, it would provide a stretch-out of the
                        preunification phase of the Western Peace plan from the present 30 months to
                        7-10 years, which would be designed to secure Soviet acceptance of an
                        improved Berlin arrangement.</p>
                    <p>4. The paper proposes a three-stage plan for execution.</p>
                    <p>(a) Internal US decisions on which of these items we now intend to press.</p>
                    <p>(b) Consultation with our allies concerning these items, immediately
                        afterward.</p>
                    <p>(c) US-Soviet informal discussion, to determine whether sufficient prospect
                        of progress exists to go forward eventually to bilateral negotiation,
                        possibly at the Summit.</p>

                    <p>1. The Three Soviet Options. Broadly speaking, there are now three major
                        options open to the Soviets:</p>
                    <p>(a) To proceed at forced draft to try to close what they regard as the
                        missile gap—or, more precisely, the imbalance in nuclear power—by
                        accelerated programs for missile submarines, <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, missile defense, weapons or platforms in space, etc.</p>
                    <p>(b) To continue current military programs and lines of foreign policy, with
                        no radical changes, while they tidy up the worldwide mess they are in and
                        sort out a new line of strategy and tactics, as after Stalin's death, in the
                        light of their assessment of U.S. and free world strengths, vulnerabilities,
                        and intentions.</p>
                    <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0595"/>
                    <p>(c) To assess the present crisis as demonstrating that the effort to extend
                        Soviet power by nuclear weapons and nuclear blackmail has failed and to turn
                        seriously to arms control and disarmament, and to more pacific means for the
                        extension of Soviet influence.</p>
                    <p>The first or second option could be accompanied, on the diplomatic level, by
                        no general negotiations; by pro forma negotiations; by limited agreements
                        that create an atmosphere of détente, without fully committing the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to a particular long course; or by an
                        effort during negotiations to project to the world that big movements
                        forward were possible, without, in fact, concluding serious agreements.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, the Soviets will not necessarily make an immediate choice among
                        these options. Should they, for example, have a preference for 1(c), they
                        might still feel that it would be better to delay until the impact of the
                        Cuban crisis had been dissipated, or even until they had succeeded in
                        restoring their power image.</p>
                    <p>It is consequently important that the US not treat first Soviet responses as
                        finally indicative of the path they are willing to follow. We should, as is
                        proposed below, have in mind a full “negotiation scenario”, but should be
                        flexible as to the timing of its inception.</p>
                    <p>Whichever alternative is chosen, the Soviets are likely to try to use a phase
                        of negotiations to encourage the West to relax and, above all, to reduce its
                        military outlays and alertness.</p>
                    <p>2. Broad Implications for U.S. Policy. The objective of U.S. policy should be
                        to move the Soviets to conclude that their interests are best served by
                        pursuing the course outlined under 1(c). The implications of this objective
                        for our negotiating posture are discussed in this paper.</p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, the first requirement of U.S. (and Alliance) policy is to
                        proceed on the assumption, until firm evidence justifies another view, that
                        the Soviets may seek by other and more expensive moves to correct the
                        nuclear imbalance which their Cuban adventure failed to achieve. U.S.
                        intelligence alertness to, and an evident willingness to block or offset,
                        such other Soviet moves to retrieve their nuclear position are required (i)
                        for purposes of national security, (ii) to maintain the favorable nuclear
                        backdrop to our current diplomacy, and (iii) to convince responsible men in
                        Moscow over the longer pull that the only realistic course open to them is
                        effectively inspected arms control and disarmament.</p>
                    <p>As between the second and third alternatives—a standstill or forward movement
                        towards détente and arms control—only the test of serious negotiations (or a
                        flat Soviet refusal to negotiate) can provide an answer.</p>
                    <p>To some degree, the choice made by Moscow will depend on our posture. The
                        President has clearly signalled that we are prepared to negotiate seriously
                        when the commitments made with respect to Cuba have been fully implemented.
                        A continuance of that stance is one factor <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0596"/>which will affect the Soviet choice. In addition, the
                        choice will be affected by whether the U.S. and its allies show continued
                        determination to develop their military strength; to maintain their unity on
                        vital issues; and to move forward towards European unity and the Atlantic
                        partnership—developments which the Soviets rank only below U.S. nuclear
                        strength, in power terms.</p>
                    <p>3. Two U.S. Tracks. Should negotiations occur, we should be fully prepared,
                        in terms of staff work, to move along either of two tracks: one relatively
                        conservative, the other representing an effort to grapple more fundamentally
                        with the major issues of international security.</p>
                    <p>4. Track A. This should consist of measures, already well staffed by
                        ourselves, in many cases familiar to our allies—and some already explored
                        with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, which would range from a
                        tidying up of the status quo to limited, but in some cases very significant,
                        movement forward. Such items are listed below. More detailed negotiating
                        positions covering these items are listed, where appropriate, in Appendix

                            additions—<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence, ban on atomic arms

                        fundamentally to solve certain security problems in Europe and definitely to
                        turn down the arms race. We need to staff out Track B, and to consult with
                        our allies about at least its disarmament aspects, in order to be prepared
                        to respond to any evidence that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, for whatever reasons, might wish to deal
                        constructively with such proposals. Such proposals are listed below, with
                        more detailed negotiating positions on each in Appendix B:<note n="7" xml:id="d263fn7">Not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>(a) Expanded Berlin/Germany Proposal. This would involve an improved position
                        for Berlin via either (i) an all-Berlin solution, or (ii) more secure
                        non-Communist control of access to West Berlin and a change in the juridical
                        status of West Berlin which keeps present Western forces. For Germany, it
                        would provide a stretchout of the Western Peace Plan from the present 2#
                        years to 7-10 years, possibly combined with some of the other Berlin/German
                        arrangements suggested in Track A, to secure Soviet acceptance of an
                        improved Berlin arrangement.</p>
                    <p>(b) Far-Reaching Disarmament. This would involve limitations on armaments
                        short of general and complete disarmament.</p>
                    <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0598"/>
                    <p>If <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> should move down a more
                        radical track in respect of disarmament, he is almost certain to do so
                        because he has now firmly decided that it is impossible to achieve a nuclear
                        balance via the arms race, in the face of Western resources, without
                        excessive economic burdens on the Soviet Union, including economic
                        constraints on its foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>If he moves down the more radical track on Berlin/Germany, it might be
                        because he believed that this would contribute to the reduction of armaments
                        suggested above, or because he wished a reduction of tensions for other
                        reasons (e.g., to avert an imminent crisis), or because his thinking had
                        cleared sufficiently to enable him to appreciate that such a Berlin/Germany
                        solution would be in his interest as well as ours.</p>
                    <p>6. The Position at the Bargaining Table. In looking forward to negotiations,
                        it is important that we be clear about one point: With respect to Cuba and
                        the offensive missiles, we mounted bargaining power—military and, to some
                        extent, political—which was capable of producing a dramatic result. Aside
                        from the new credibility of our military posture and the favorable military
                        balance we command, we shall bring to the bargaining table on the issues
                        listed below no such pressures and advantages as we enjoyed in the
                        Caribbean. Whatever bargaining positions we may devise, we should be clear
                        that Moscow will be under no great compulsion to accept formulae which are
                        not evenly balanced as between our interests and theirs.</p>
                    <p>7. Basic Elements for a Negotiating Scenario.</p>
                    <p>Aside from decisions on the substance of the draft negotiating positions
                        attached in Appendices A and B, there appear to be three steps required in
                        moving towards negotiation.</p>
                    <p>(a) An internal U.S. government decision to negotiate and to approve the
                        concepts, agenda, and terms we intend to bring to the table. This is urgent
                        business. Many—if not most—of the items listed under Track A do not require
                        new US policy decisions. Track B would generally require new decisions.</p>
                    <p>(b) Consultation with Allies. We have handled the Cuban crisis on our own
                        and, broadly, to the satisfaction of our allies; but we must evidently
                        correct the notion that we intend to make unilateralism (or bilateralism
                        with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>) a habit. Even if we should
                        be pointed toward a meeting of the Big Two we must scrupulously consult in
                        advance. On the other hand, it is our interest to maintain in diplomacy the
                        unambiguous role of leadership we assumed in crisis. We should, therefore,
                        discuss with our allies the possibilities on arms control and Berlin/Germany
                        proposals in Track A, although the French reaction may be chilly.</p>
                    <p>(c) Explorations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. After
                        consultation with allies and assuming agreement to negotiate, we must
                        explore with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> our concept of how
                        negotiations should proceed and establish a forum both for quiet bilateral
                        discussion of the agenda and for preliminary negotiation to establish which,
                        if any, issues are likely to prove negotiable.</p>
                    <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0599"/>
                    <p>Essentially, there are three possible points of initial contact and for
                        subsequent preliminary negotiation: Moscow, New York, and Washington. On the
                        whole, Washington represents the optimum locus, among other reasons because
                        we have in the quadripartite Ambassadorial Group a ready instrument for
                        quick consultation with our major allies.</p>
                    <p>If it emerges that there is likely to be some serious business to do at
                        higher levels, the possibility of a Foreign Ministers meeting (either
                        bilateral with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, or of the four
                        occupying powers of Germany if Berlin is involved) might be considered.</p>
                    <p>Or we might go to a summit; a decision on this point now would be
                        premature.</p>
                    <p>Our general posture towards summitry should return to the post-Vienna
                        formula: We are prepared for a summit meeting—bilateral or otherwise; but we
                        do not believe that one should take place unless we are assured that both
                        sides are tolerably clear, before the event, as to the purposes of a
                        summit—whether it is for specific negotiations (in which case some prior
                        assurance of significant forward movement would be necessary) or whether it
                        is a general probing and atmospheric operation rather than a
                        negotiation.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of a negotiating summit from our point of view would be
                        threefold: to ratify agreements roughed out in advance; to permit the
                        President to explore possible further avenues for negotiation in direct
                        confrontations with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>; and
                        to permit the test of negotiations at the highest level to help clarify
                        basic Soviet intentions with respect to the three options presented on page
                        1 of this paper.</p>
                    <p>If such a negotiating summit were bilateral, some issues of bilateral concern
                        to the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> (e.g., safeguards
                        against miscalculation) could be agreed and others of broader concern (e.g.,
                        Berlin and Germany) could only be discussed, and the US and Soviet Foreign
                        Ministers then instructed to pursue the matter with the other parties
                        directly concerned, i.e., in a Four Power forum.</p>
                    <p>It is altogether possible that the post-crisis period will unfold in such a
                        way that the second and third aspects of the scenario cannot be cleanly
                        separated; that is, explorations with our allies and with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Under these circumstances, it is
                        peculiarly important that we establish soon a flexible and responsible
                        instrument for steady consultation with our allies, so that we can keep in
                        step and avoid any further imputation that we are proceeding from a direct
                        bilateral military confrontation to a bilateral negotiation, in which
                        Alliance interests are not adequately expressed. As noted above, the
                        Ambassadorial Group in Washington appears the optimum candidate.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The Embassy recommends that the Department, in any appropriate discussions of
                        outstanding problems with the Soviet Government which might follow
                        satisfactory resolution of the Cuban missile problem, place Soviet
                        information policy high on the agenda as the greatest single cause of
                        misunderstanding between the two countries.</p>
                    <p>In calls on Soviet officials, I have made a practice of raising our concern
                        over Soviet jamming of U.S. broadcasts, stating I find this the most
                        shocking single reminder of the past in the Soviet Union. Some, although not
                        all nor necessarily the most influential, Soviet officials are sensitive to
                        criticism of jamming. Certainly many Soviet citizens resent jamming.</p>
                    <p>I have placed great emphasis in official conversations here on the
                        President's belief in effective communications with the Soviet Union as the
                        cornerstone of our efforts to preserve peace. This means both private and
                        public communications. As regards public communications, I think we are at
                        the moment in a good tactical position to press for modification of the
                        practically total censorship of U.S. foreign policy statements by the Soviet
                        press, radio, and television. If the Soviet Government had earlier allowed
                        wide dissemination of U.S. statements on Cuba (specifically, the President's
                        September statements), it could hardly have gotten itself—and the world—into
                        the predicament it eventually found itself in.</p>
                    <p>It may be helpful to point to the fact that at the height of the tension
                        during the first week of the Cuban crisis, the Soviet press finally
                        published two statements by President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>. This presentation of the other side of the question
                        clearly aided the Soviet Government to explain its own actions. We should
                        press for this kind of presentation. We do not object to criticism or press
                        attacks on our position as long as our position is made known.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy is not sanguine that drastic modification of Soviet information
                        policy is likely to be obtained. It is even more probable in the difficult
                        period of stress and policy review which can be expected to take place here
                        that Soviet information policy will be even more rigid. But the vivid
                        examples of the need for better communications at all levels is there <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0601"/>to be used, and the Embassy
                        suggests it should be exploited in discussions of outstanding problems with
                        the Soviets.</p>

                    <p>[Here follow 7 pages of discussion on the Cuban missile crisis.]</p>
                    <p>The conversation then switched abruptly to broader questions involving
                        long-range US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations. I remarked
                        that once we clear up the remaining elements of the Cuba controversy, it may
                        fairly be said that both countries are moving towards a crossroads of great
                        decisiveness. The next five years might either see a great and costly
                        intensification of the present conflict or a conscientious effort by both
                        sides to negotiate a genuine and lasting settlement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said facetiously that
                        although he agreed with my general view, he would like to stretch my five
                        years to six years since this was the likely life of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> Administration, and who could tell what
                        would follow it.</p>
                    <p>He then asked me to spell out more clearly what steps I felt were necessary
                        to bring about this better relationship. I suggested four points:</p>
                    <p>1. The Soviet Union must become convinced that its attempts to spread
                        communism throughout the world are no longer worth the efforts and the
                        risks. The policy-makers in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> must
                        understand that we Americans view international communism as an ideological
                        instrument designed and directed by the Soviet Union to destroy us and all
                        other independent peoples.</p>
                    <p>I suggested that this effort is doomed to failure not because the people of
                        Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe prefer a world run by America, but
                        because people are committed to their own futures which are bound to be
                        deeply diversified.</p>
                    <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0602"/>
                    <p>I remarked that I had just returned from Africa and I could assure him that
                        no African wants to be Russianized, Americanized, Sinocized, or Anglicized;
                        they want to become free, independent people in their own right.</p>
                    <p>In this respect, our task was much easier than the Soviets' because we are
                        striving to give people that opportunity, and we are sophisticated enough to
                        realize that they are not necessarily going to become our devoted supporters
                        in the process.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, if the Alliance for Progress succeeded, it was possible that Latin
                        American nations would on occasion see the world situation quite differently
                        than we simply because they had developed a greater sense of independence
                        and self-confidence. If so, we would be quite satisfied since it would also
                        mean they were now impervious to subversion from any outside source.</p>
                    <p>2. The US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> must come to
                        understand each other's commitments and to help each other to disentangle
                        ourselves from situations which are to no one's advantage.</p>
                    <p>Under no circumstances, however, could the Soviets expect us to turn our
                        backs on our allies, any more than we expect them to abandon theirs.</p>
                    <p>3. A nuclear test-ban and eventual arms control were vital. An
                        intensification or even a continuation of the present arms race is not only
                        costly to each of us, but also extremely dangerous.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, if this conflict continues indefinitely, important groups of people
                        in both the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the USA will develop
                        increasing material and psychological stakes in maintaining the present
                        political and military impasse indefinitely. This will mean that each
                        government will gradually lose its ability to change the basic
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>4. We must cooperate in stopping the spread of nuclear weapons to other
                        powers. It would be particularly dangerous if China should secure nuclear
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked about Germany. I said
                        that while we had no desire to see the West Germans develop a nuclear
                        capacity, we carry major responsibility for their defense, and this can only
                        be assured with a nuclear capacity in the hands of our troops.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> added that many of his
                        associates felt we have been encouraging the reactionary elements in
                        Germany. I denied this, stressing that when Stalin armed the East Germans,
                        we had to choose between a much more major U.S. force in Europe or arms for
                        the West Germans.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked if my views about a
                        summit meeting between Kennedy and Khrushchev had changed. I stated that I
                        saw nothing to change the situation since our last talk,<note n="2" xml:id="d265fn2">See <ref target="#d246">Document 246</ref>.</note> when
                        he and I had agreed that it would <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0603"/>be a mistake to hold a summit meeting unless there were clear areas of
                        agreement which we knew in advance could be isolated and announced.</p>
                    <p>I said that in addition to Cuba, which I hoped we could get out of the way
                        soon, perhaps the most fruitful area for agreement would be in nuclear
                        testing.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that while he agreed
                        with my response in general, he would like to have us understand that Soviet
                        concern about underground testing was genuine. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, he said, does not have access to large underground caves,
                        as does the United States, and the cost of preparing such caves is very
                        expensive. In respect to weapons adapted to underground testing, he added
                        frankly, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is now behind and does
                        not want to see its disadvantage further increased.</p>
                    <p>I suggested that at least we could announce agreement on atmosphere and
                        under-water testing and possibly work out an agreement that would bring our
                        scientists together for a stated period to work out an inspection system
                        that would enable us to agree to a ban on underground testing. I emphasized
                        that in making this suggestion I was speaking for myself, for in no sense
                        was I an expert.</p>
                    <p>The conversation then switched to India. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether I felt the war between China and
                        India was likely to become more serious. I suggested facetiously that he was
                        in a better position to answer his own question since the petroleum products
                        on which the Chinese were dependent must be coming largely from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and, considering the long supply lines,
                        the undertaking must be a major one.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> soberly remarked that the
                        Soviet Union is extremely worried about the conflict, that China was an
                        “ally” and India a “good friend”, and that frankly this placed the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in a difficult position.</p>
                    <p>Although his government had not made any specific suggestions as to how the
                        conflict could be settled (he did not know whether the McMahon Line was
                        proper or not), he felt that every effort should be made to end the fighting
                        since otherwise it could spread.</p>
                    <p>I then asked if Nehru had been correct in stating that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was planning to carry out its commitment
                        to ship <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21s to India. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that although he had had no
                        recent word from his government, a commitment had been made and he assumed
                        that it would be carried out. Nevertheless, it was embarrassing since it had
                        been made under quite different circumstances, i.e. before the outbreak of
                        serious fighting between the Chinese and the Indians.</p>
                    <p>I remarked that it would be my assumption that the Soviets would like to have
                        some kind of truce within the next 30 days which would allow them to carry
                        out their commitment to send the Indians <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s, without arousing the ire of the Chinese. However, it was my
                        feeling that the conflict would continue at least into next summer.</p>
                    <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0604"/>
                    <p>When <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked why I dismissed
                        the possibility of a quicker settlement, I pointed out that Indian public
                        opinion had been greatly aroused, and even Nehru could not turn it off if he
                        wanted to. Indeed, I could image only one way that a truce could become
                        possible in the next few weeks: the willingness of the Chinese to back away
                        completely from their present position, a willingness which could only be
                        produced if the Soviets clamped down hard on Chinese petroleum supplies.</p>
                    <p>Failing this development, I suggested that the Indians would not be willing
                        to accept a truce until they felt more confident of their ability to handle
                        the Chinese militarily.</p>
                    <p>In closing, the conversation turned to Southeast Asia. I stated that I had
                        talked that morning with <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Averell
                            Harriman</persName> who was deeply concerned about the situation in
                        Laos. Although, <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> was
                        doing his best, the Pathet Lao were continuing to create difficulties. It
                        was clear to everyone that the main source of trouble is in Hanoi. What
                        could the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> do to help settle this
                        question?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that we could count
                        on the willingness of the USSR to do its utmost in regard to Laos. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> felt that he had a
                        specific commitment to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> in this area which he intended to carry out.</p>
                    <p>I suggested that the real trouble-makers in Southeast Asia were the Viet
                        Minh. Was it not possible for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                        get better control of the situation either through supplies or through other
                        means of dealing with the Hanoi government? As long as the Viet Minh
                        continued to supply the Viet Cong there would be trouble in Vietnam, and we
                        would have to stand our ground.</p>
                    <p>We could not allow the Viet Minh to upset the South Vietnam government, and
                        we had the capacity to keep them from doing so. However, the sooner we could
                        settle these problems, the fewer lives would be lost, and the less danger
                        would exist of providing an opening for the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>As we walked towards the door, I again reminded <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that he must not assume that the views I expressed
                        necessarily represented those of my government; that I had simply expressed
                        my own frank thoughts in the hope that they might be helpful to him in
                        understanding the way we looked at the present situation.</p>
                    <p>Throughout this two-hour freewheeling, give-and-take conversation, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was relaxed and pleasant; he
                        talked with a general air of frankness.</p>

                            from Halaby to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>. Schetchikov
                            was in Washington to attend the Dulles International Airport dedication
                            ceremonies.</note>

                        <placeName>Washington</placeName>, <date from="1962-11-15" to="1962-11-17">November 15 and 17, 1962</date>.</dateline>
                    <p>It was clear from the outset that the primary mission of General
                        Schetchikov's trip to Washington was to reiterate the desire of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to proceed with the signing of the
                        bilateral air transport agreement negotiated in 1961 which would provide for
                        establishment of regular air service between New York and Moscow by Aeroflot
                        and <gloss target="#t_PAA1">PAA</gloss>. At every opportunity, regardless of
                        the audience, the General made the point that this was a desirable and
                        worthwhile step which would be well received by the whole world, which was
                        watching, as a sign of better relations between our two governments. This
                        view reached its climax during the first discussion between General
                        Schetchikov and Mr. Halaby on November 15 when he stated that he was
                        authorized to sign this agreement on behalf of his government and felt that,
                        unless this could be done, it appeared that the agreement should be scrapped
                        as being too far off in the future to warrant its retention in a pending
                        status. He concluded by requesting Mr. Halaby to obtain for him an official
                        answer on the attitude of the U.S. Government in this regard.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Halaby pointed out that this was a matter involving other offices of our
                        Government and that he foresaw difficulties in obtaining an official
                        response to his question on such short notice, but that he would make an
                        effort to do so before the time of his departure. The General thanked Mr.
                        Halaby and stated that he would be willing to remain longer if there were
                        prospects of a favorable response.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Halaby then conferred with the Secretary of State, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, and with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Llewellyn Thompson</persName>, and received a prompt
                        reply for transmittal to the Russian party. Accordingly, an appointment was
                        arranged for 5:30 on Saturday, November 17, 1962. General Schetchikov
                        arrived with Mr. Yarotski and with Mr. Victor Novash, Third Secretary of the
                        Soviet Embassy, who had not participated in the previous meeting. Mr. Halaby
                        advised General Schetchikov that, as promised, he had carried out the
                        necessary consultations and the U.S. Government position had been
                        determined, which he was authorized to give to General Schetchikov. Mr.
                        Halaby pointed out that normally such inter-governmental matters would be
                        taken up through their Foreign Minister with <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0606"/>the Department of State, but since General Schetchikov had
                        been authorized by his Government to sign the agreement, this special effort
                        had been made to provide him an answer. That is: Because of all the
                        unsettled matters between the United States and the Union of Soviet
                        Socialist Republics, it is still considered premature for the United States
                        to sign this agreement. The United States Government would, however, keep
                        this matter under continuous review and advise them through appropriate
                        government channels of any change. General Schetchikov took this answer very
                        calmly, said he regretted this was the answer but, if the U.S. changed its
                        mind, to let them know and they would be ready to sign.</p>
                    <p>As a sidelight of the above exchanges, General Schetchikov made the statement
                        on several occasions that it appeared to him one of the reasons we were
                        apparently not ready to sign the agreement was the fact that we did not have
                        a suitable aircraft to use on the New York-Moscow route, implying that our
                        jets did not have sufficient range. During the discussions with the <gloss target="#t_ATA1">ATA</gloss>, this matter arose again and we laid before
                        General Schetchikov the performance figures of the Boeing 320B, which
                        indicated a still air range of 4,000 <gloss target="#t_NM1">NM</gloss> with
                        the design maximum payload of 53,600 lbs., and a range with full tanks of
                        7,000 <gloss target="#t_NM1">NM</gloss> with an 18,000 lbs. payload;
                        therefore, he was misinformed on this point. Although this information is
                        readily available from many sources, the General appeared to be somewhat
                        surprised and unwilling to accept that this was an aircraft now in service.
                        He finally concluded by saying, “Well, just as I expected, there is no
                        technical reason for the agreement's not being consummated.”</p>

                    <p>DEAR TOMMY: I came away from my conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on Thursday<note n="2" xml:id="d267fn2">See <ref target="#d265">Document 265</ref>.</note> with renewed conviction
                        that a struggle of decisive importance may be under way in the Kremlin.</p>
                    <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0607"/>
                    <p>I was struck in particular by the intense interest with which <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> received my repeated comment that,
                        with good management and a genuine desire in Moscow as well as in
                        Washington, the time might be approaching when a breakthrough would be
                        possible in the area of arms control; and that this, in turn, could lead to
                        fruitful Soviet-American cooperation on a wide variety of fronts,
                        particularly in Asia.</p>
                    <p>In reacting to my comments, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        seemed at times to be virtually pleading for some sign from us that would
                        make <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s task easier in
                        achieving such a breakthrough.</p>
                    <p>If, in fact, such possibilities are now being debated in the Kremlin, might
                        it not be useful for us to provide the more moderate elements in the Soviet
                        leadership with tangible, up-to-date evidence that we are prepared for some
                        basic discussions once the Cuba crisis is behind us? And could this not be
                        effectively achieved if the President, in answer to a question at tomorrow's
                        press conference, were to refer to and quote from his <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> speech of September 25, 1961?<note n="3" xml:id="d267fn3">For text of this speech, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the

                    <p>He would of course want to stress, as a prior condition for such discussion,

                    <p>1362. I. During course my recent calls on high-ranking officials both in and
                        outside <gloss target="#t_MFA1">MFA</gloss>, Soviet side has sung chorus on
                        theme of need for settling problems by “compromise” and mutual concessions”.
                        Officials have invariably suggested time propitious to move ahead toward
                        resolution outstanding problems, generally with specific reference
                        disarmament and to Europe.</p>
                    <p>Similar line has been followed by East European diplomats. There has been
                        little real evidence of just what this means in terms of Soviets' intentions
                        or even hopes. Elements which must be affecting current reconsideration of
                        scenario, however, clearly include:</p>
                    <p>1. Effect of Cuban crisis on previous idea of Soviet leadership as to U.S.
                        determination, firmness of Western alliances and support of Soviet people
                        for adventures abroad.</p>
                    <p>2. Complications which denouement of crisis has introduced into already
                        difficult intra-bloc conflict.</p>
                    <p>3. Obviously uncoordination ChiCom action on Indian border.</p>
                    <p>4. Domestic problems, notably question of optimum allocation of resources and
                        shortage of foreign exchange.</p>
                    <p>II. Presumably, first concrete indications of genuineness of Soviet readiness
                        to reach agreements would manifest themselves in nuclear test talks at
                        Geneva and in disarmament negotiations where Soviets likely willing discuss
                        and possibly even accept first step measures which could reduce likelihood
                        surprise attack and war by miscalculations; there have been hints this might
                        include very slight compromise on test inspection and revival of Soviet
                        proposals of 1955 for reciprocal stationing military observers at chosen
                        points in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw Pact areas.</p>
                    <p>On Germany and Berlin, there have been only straws in wind, notably:</p>
                    <p>1. Relative restraint in Berlin itself and on autobahn.</p>
                    <p>2. Recision of military alert and readiness measures following Cuban
                        crisis.</p>
                    <p>3. Aquiescence in press treatment and public statements, including speeches
                        at East European conferences, notable as regards threat of separate peace
                        treaty.</p>
                    <p>4. In contrast, increased stress on arrangements “regulating the relations
                        between the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Warsaw Pact
                        countries”, starting with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s published letters to President and then taken up by
                        press.</p>

                    <p>5. Hints by Soviet officials of some let-up in Soviet insistence on troops
                        question if change in status West Berlin could be achieved.</p>
                    <p>6. Indications Soviets have had little favorable reaction from uncommitted
                        governments to separate peace treaty.</p>
                    <p>III. It seems possible to us, in light these rather flimsy indicators, that
                        Soviet leadership may well be thinking along following lines:</p>
                    <p>1. Attempts to apply “consequences” of separate peace treaty too dangerous
                        and gesture of having such document signed only by bloc and left
                        unimplemented evidence more of weakness than of strength.</p>
                    <p>2. No package deal on Germany and Berlin now obtainable which does not leave
                        impression Soviet set-back in at least tacitly giving blessing “occupation
                        status” West Berlin and continued presence Western forces.</p>
                    <p>3. In circumstances, best bet for Soviets lies in conclusion non-aggression
                        arrangements between <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Warsaw Pact,
                        coupled with some related “surprise attack” and “nuclear non-diffusion”
                        measures. This would be in keeping with present posture of Khrushchev as
                        “man of peace”, improve atmosphere and possibly lead to some relaxation
                        within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. At same time, this would
                        inevitably enhance status <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>
                        regime and constitute at least tacit recognition <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> borders, thus giving impetus to Western public's acceptance
                        of division of Germany.</p>
                    <p>While change in status West Berlin desirable to Soviets also, this not
                        essential at this stage. Status quo could be maintained as regards Western
                        forces and access for time being, but Soviets would not be deprived of
                        possibility subjecting West Berlin to current pressures and squeezes.</p>
                    <p>Obviously such approach would have its dangers for West, along with possible
                        advantages in securing some blessing of status quo. In any case, we consider
                        real enough as possibility to warrant careful study by Dept and then perhaps
                        quadripartitely.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>1. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s venture in Cuba has made a
                        whole range of problems in both internal and foreign policy more difficult
                        for the Soviet leaders to manage. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> gambled that he could score a dramatic victory
                        over the US which he apparently believed would give him an important
                        advantage in strategic confrontation with the US, probably including an
                        early diplomatic showdown on Berlin and Germany. Soviet leaders must now be
                        wrestling with the internal and foreign policy implications of their
                        defeat.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s position as the leader
                        of the <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> and the Soviet government is
                        not likely to be seriously weakened. However, Khrushchev's failure in Cuba,
                        and the inevitable post-mortems that will follow it, will further diminish
                        his ability unilaterally to shape future Soviet policies. The pattern of
                        Soviet government as it has evolved since Stalin's death has made it
                        increasingly necessary for its leader to cope with pressures generated by
                        different political, social, and economic groups. The Cuban failure will
                        tend to spur these groups to press their viewpoints more vigorously.</p>
                    <p>3. The Cuban venture will almost certainly cause the Soviet leaders to
                        re-assess the perennially difficult problem of how to allocate the country's
                        resources to further Moscow's aims in its competition with the West. Cuba
                        demonstrated that Soviet strategic power is not sufficient to deter the US
                        from responding forcefully to protect its vital interests. This realization
                        will sharpen the debate between proponents of a speed-up in the growth of
                        Soviet military power and those who will argue that more resources must be
                        allocated to the non-military components of the economy.</p>
                    <p>4. Soviet leaders will also be concerned with the serious effects of the
                        Cuban affair on Moscow's leadership of the world Communist movement.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> moved quickly to
                        forestall any adverse repercussions in Eastern Europe by calling Satellite
                        leaders to Moscow during the crisis. Even so, their confidence in his
                        judgment must have been shaken. Many Communist leaders in other parts of the
                        world also look upon the Cuban affair as an ill-conceived Soviet
                        adventure.</p>
                    <p>5. Finally, Moscow must deal with the intensification of its dispute with
                        China which has accompanied the Cuban affair. The Soviet back<pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583" facs="0611"/>down on Cuba has increased <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s vulnerability to charges by
                        China and his other opponents in the Communist movement that his basic
                        strategy of coexistence has failed again. Soviet leaders are no doubt
                        debating this increased threat to Soviet hegemony over the Communist
                        movement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Basic Policy Considerations</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>6. We have no reason to believe that any foreseeable turn in Soviet policy
                        will result in a decisive change in the nature of the contest between the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the US. The basic, long-range
                        goals of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> have not changed; the
                        self-interests of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are the same
                        after Cuba as they were before. For example, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will be no more inclined now than it was before Cuba to
                        give up its hegemony in Eastern Europe—and hence its control over East
                        Germany.</p>
                    <p>7. In the years ahead, Soviet policy will continue to be shaped by the
                        tensions and contradiction between two sets of interests and
                        consideration:</p>
                    <p>a. Impelling them towards establishing a more normal relationship with the
                        West will be their image of themselves as the rulers of a great world power,
                        their desire to gain US recognition of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s claim to be accepted as an equal in world councils,
                        their awareness of the consequences of nuclear war, and the needs of Soviet
                        industry and science for greater access to Western technology. b. Impelling
                        them in the opposite direction will be Moscow's need to maintain leadership
                        of a revolutionary movement with universal aspirations, and the fundamental
                        problem of preserving, perpetuating, and justifying the exclusive role of a
                        party machine whose claim to legitimacy rests on Marxism-Leninism—a creed
                        which dictates a public posture of antagonism toward the “imperialist camp”
                        and precludes any genuine or lasting accommodation of conflicting views and
                        interests with the West.</p>
                    <p>8. These conflicting pressures and goals will continue to be manifested in
                        wide fluctuations in Soviet relations with the free world. East-West
                        competition on a global scale will inevitably produce further clashes and
                        crisis situations, particularly in the Afro-Asian areas, and permit no more
                        than temporary and shifting truces and accommodations on specific issues.
                        Aside from these collisions inherent in the global contest, the pressures on
                        Soviet policy stemming from China's challenge and the growing instability in
                        the whole structure of the world Communist movement would appear to rule out
                        any possibility of a real détente with the West based on traditional Western
                        conceptions of the proper rules of international relations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Alternative Courses</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>9. We do not expect Moscow to resolve its problems quickly. While they are
                        being debated over the next month or so, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will pursue a <pb n="584" xml:id="pg_584" facs="0612"/>temporizing and cautious course in international affairs. Their immediate
                        concern will be to minimize the effects of the Cuban backdown and to avoid
                        further setbacks, while at the same time seeking limited gains which can be
                        represented as vindication for Moscow's current foreign policy. Clear signs
                        of a major turn in Soviet foreign policy may not appear for some time.</p>
                    <p>10. The discussion we believe is now going on within the Soviet leadership,
                        therefore, is over alternative means of achieving Moscow's basic goals. In
                        theory, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> can opt either for
                        (a) a hard militant line which would rest on the assumption that further
                        major Soviet advances are not possible until Soviet military power catches
                        or surpasses that of the US; or (b) a policy of limited agreements with the
                        West designed to reduce international tensions and permit the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to devote more of its resources to
                        competing with the West in the economic and political arenas.</p>
                    <p>11. An accelerated effort by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                        achieve a preponderance of military power over the US would have a number of
                        far-reaching implications for Soviet domestic and foreign policy. It would
                        require a sharp increase in allocations to heavy industry and in defense
                        expenditures and an indefinite postponement in fulfilling promises to
                        improve the lot of Soviet consumers. It probably would also mean at least a
                        temporary suppression of certain “liberal” tendencies in some phases of
                        Soviet cultural and political life which have been given cautious
                        encouragement in recent years.</p>
                    <p>12. In embarking on such a policy, the Soviet leaders would presumably have
                        decided that there was no point—until their relative power position had
                        improved—in trying to get a favorable resolution of such long standing
                        issues as Berlin, a nuclear test ban, and disarmament. On these issues, as
                        well as on other points at issue with the West, their primary interest would
                        be to maintain the status quo until they felt strong enough to adopt a more
                        forward strategy.</p>
                    <p>13. In the field of intra-bloc relations, Moscow probably would hope that a
                        policy of rapid development of advanced military capabilities would ease the
                        problem of dealing with Peiping's challenge to Soviet leadership of the
                        Communist movement and that a military stance toward the West would help
                        disarm some of the most telling Chinese criticisms of Soviet policy.</p>
                    <p>14. Adoption of the alternative course would mean that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had decided that it had a better chance
                        of winning the contest with the West if it could allocate more of its
                        resources to non-military ends. A paramount objective of this course,
                        therefore, would be to reduce the pace and scope of the arms race. To do
                        this, Moscow would attempt to create an international atmosphere which would
                        make it more difficult for the West to maintain its present defense
                        efforts.</p>
                    <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0613"/>
                    <p>15. This course would thus increase the incentive of the Soviet leaders to
                        reach some agreement with the West which could be represented as
                        demonstrating the success and validity of their policies. It would encourage
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to scale down his
                        demands on certain key issues and increase his desire to reach at least a
                        temporary understanding on Berlin. In the field of disarmament, this policy
                        would lead the Soviets to give serious consideration to working out an early
                        agreement on the cessation of nuclear tests because this would, in their
                        view, carry an important symbolic significance to the world that a major
                        advance had been made in bringing the arms race under control. The USSR,
                        moreover, probably would be willing to seek agreement on other partial
                        disarmament measures, such as an arrangement preventing the further
                        diffusion of nuclear weapons, a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw
                        Pact non-aggression treaty, and possibly measures to reduce the danger of
                        surprise attack.</p>
                    <p>16. On balance, and depending to a large extent on Western attitudes, we
                        believe the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will lean toward the
                        second alternative.</p>
                    <p>17. If the US should elect to pursue an assertive course directed at
                        extracting further Soviet concessions on key issues, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> unquestionably would react
                        strongly. He will be particularly sensitive to any signs that the US is
                        trying to take advantage of his humiliation. He publicly warned last year
                        that if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should retreat from its
                        commitments (in this case, a separate peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>) the Western powers “would regard this as a
                        strategic breakthrough and would widen the range of their demands at once.”
                        He would interpret an increase in US pressure as an attempt to complicate
                        his problems with the Chinese and would seek to reduce his vulnerability to
                        Peiping by taking up a more defiant and militant stance toward the US. The
                        general effect of an assertive and demanding US posture, in our view, would
                        be to increase the likelihood that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would decide that he had no alternative but to
                        opt for the first course of action outlined above.</p>
                    <p>18. If the United States were to offer considerable concessions in hopes of
                        inducing a Soviet turn toward reasonableness in international affairs, this
                        would probably be misunderstood in Moscow. Rather than providing ready
                        arguments for a hoped-for liberal element in the Soviet leadership, such an
                        attitude would support those who believe that liberal democracies are
                        essentially soft societies. They would probably then interpret our
                        determination over Cuba as an aberration, as an essentially emotional
                        response triggered perhaps by internal political considerations. The result
                        of this misinterpretation of our motives would probably be a return of
                        Soviet policy to a harder line in hopes of regrasping the initiative they
                        have lost in international affairs.</p>
                    <p>19. If the US, however, should indicate readiness to proceed with
                        negotiations on Berlin, a nuclear test ban, and disarmament on roughly the
                        same terms that prevailed before the Cuban crisis, we believe <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0614"/>would be encouraged to follow up
                        his initial postcrisis feelers and move toward a resumption of Berlin
                        negotiations. He realizes that the Cuban backdown has weakened his
                        bargaining position and he probably would feel he must have a period of
                        several months for rebuilding the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
                        position before undertaking serious negotiations. This requirement of a
                        pause, however, would not preclude serious explorations on a nuclear test
                        ban in the Geneva talks or informal discussions on Berlin.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Consequences for Sino-Soviet Relations</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>20. A movement of Soviet policy in the direction noted above could not help
                        but exacerbate the already deeply serious Sino-Soviet dispute. The Chinese,
                        in their attempts to prevent a Soviet accommodation with the West that would
                        be at their expense, have now broken all but the most formal ties which
                        previously united them and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Their
                        efforts to exploit the failure of Khrushchev's Cuban policy, and what they
                        have termed a “Soviet Munich,” have now driven the two parties so far apart
                        that a further exacerbation, possibly in connection with the Sino-Indian
                        border conflict, might lead to an open break.</p>
                    <p>21. The increasing virulence of the dispute has shattered the myth of
                        monolithic unity which once provided a psychological boost to Communist
                        claims of superiority, has stimulated the already sharp Soviet and Chinese
                        competition for influence in the Communist movement, and has encouraged the
                        growth of factionalism in many Communist parties. If the Soviet Union and
                        China grow further apart ideologically and continue to pursue disparate
                        foreign policies, the present trend toward diversity and polycentrism in the
                        international Communist movement will become impossible to reverse. The
                        atmosphere that will develop within the Communist world will be more and
                        more conducive to the development of national Communist parties which will
                        find it easier to sacrifice their international Communist aims for
                        nationalist ones.</p>
                    <p>22. The deepest roots of the conflict lie in the contest for authority within
                        the Communist world. For this reason, we believe that, except perhaps in
                        some crisis which endangers vital interests, external pressures are unlikely
                        to drive the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and China back together.
                        In this situation Western policy can be a significant factor in determining
                        the intensity of the division.</p>
                    <p>23. In the first place, the general success or failure encountered by Bloc
                        foreign policies will influence the course of the dispute. If neither the
                        Chinese nor the Soviets score notable gains, basic disagreements on how to
                        advance the Communist cause will become more acute and the level of polemics
                        will rise. These circumstances would assist the trend toward diversity
                        throughout the movement.</p>
                    <pb n="587" xml:id="pg_587" facs="0615"/>
                    <p>24. In the second place, the Chinese are deeply suspicious that Soviet talk
                        of “peaceful coexistence” in fact masks a desire to reach a real
                        accommodation with the capitalist world, and probably at Peiping's expense.
                        Thus the very fact of Soviet-American negotiations, especially if they are
                        conducted in a spirit of compromise rather than maximum hostility, provoke
                        Chinese calls for “all-out revolutionary struggle” and serve to exacerbate
                        the dispute. In this connection, the Chinese are particularly sensitive to
                        negotiations on nuclear topics—a test ban and a non-diffusion agreement—in
                        which they perceive a Soviet effort to hamper their own nuclear program.</p>
                    <p>25. We believe that the continuation and, if possible, the exacerbation of
                        the Sino-Soviet dispute is in the interests of the United States. It tends
                        to diminish the prestige and fragment the power structure of the Communist
                        world and—if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> adopts a moderate
                        tactical line as we anticipate—increasingly drives Communist China into a
                        strategic isolation damaging to its image as the revolutionary model for the
                        underdeveloped nations of the world.</p>

                    <p>On November 29 and 30, 1962, Soviet First Deputy Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Anastas Mikoyan</persName>, who had been in Havana
                        following the missile crisis, visited Washington. In a conversation on
                        November 29 lasting over 3 hours, <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> discussed at length the Cuban situation and briefly
                        Laos before turning to U.S.-U.S.S.R. relations. At this point:</p>
                    <p>“The President said that it is strange that there are two countries such as
                        the Soviet Union and the United States which are powerful and wealthy, and
                        which have no direct conflicts of interest to separate them. In spite of
                        that, they find themselves perpetually in a state bordering on conflict. At
                        the same time many other parts of the world are facing problems of hunger
                        and underdevelopment. It would be good if the Soviet Union were to devote
                        its efforts to the pursuit of its own interests, in the same way in which
                        the United States devotes its efforts to the pursuit of its own interests,
                        and abandon the belief that it is its job to kindle revolutionary fires all
                        over the world. This would be worth more than 40 non-aggression
                        treaties.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that revolutions are
                        not caused by the Soviet Union. It is not the Soviet Union which was the
                        cause of the Cuban revolution; <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0616"/>as a
                        matter of fact it knew much less about this revolution than did the United
                        States. He already had said the same thing in January.</p>
                    <p>“The President said that he did not accuse the Soviet Union of having
                        fomented the Cuban revolution.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that there will be
                        revolutions regardless of what either the Soviet Union or the United States
                        do.</p>
                    <p>“The President said that this may be true, but that it was still important
                        for the two countries to understand each other better. How could the Soviet
                        Government believe that the United States would not react on finding that
                        there were 40 missiles emplaced in Cuba? How would the Soviets have reacted
                        if the United States had emplaced 40 missiles in Finland, especially if the
                        government of that country had been as inimical to the Soviet Union as
                        Castro is towards the United States?</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that there are
                        United States missiles in Turkey very close to the Soviet Union. In spite of
                        that he feels that Soviet citizens may sleep with tranquility, as long as
                        the missiles in question are in American hands. This is because he trusts
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                    <p>“The President said that he has always been of the opinion that American
                        missile bases such as those in Turkey do not make sense. Several have been
                        deactivated and for the last twenty months the United States Government has
                        worked at deactivating more. This is why the emplacing of Soviet missiles in
                        Cuba has come as such a shock.</p>
                    <p>“It is quite clear that the two governments have misjudged one another. This
                        is a type of misjudgment which neither they nor the world can afford.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that he liked the
                        spirit of what the President just said. That is why it is necessary to talk
                        problems over and to agree.</p>
                    <p>“The President said that it was not enough to obtain verbal agreements. They
                        also must be implemented. It would be better perhaps if—as in the case of
                        Laos—the Soviet Union would not always insist that it is fulfilling its
                        obligations. It would be better if it were ready to admit its shortcomings
                        as the United States is ready to admit its own shortcomings, and work harder
                        to correct them.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that problems had to
                        be taken up one by one.</p>
                    <p>“The President said that in doing so it must be remembered that the two
                        countries have very few genuinely divergent interests, and yet there are
                        many conflicts between them. There is something very wrong with such a
                        situation.” (Memorandum of conversation; Kennedy Library, National Security

                        supplement to volume VII. With regard to the non-aggression pact:</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said he wanted to raise
                        one more question. During the conversation with the President at the White
                        House last night, the Cuban question had taken up so much time there had
                        been no chance for a thorough discussion of the question of a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw non-aggression pact. The President
                        himself had raised the question. Why do we not proceed to conclude such a
                        pact? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> observed he could
                        inform Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> about this
                        upon his return to Moscow. He asked if the American side was in a position
                        to give him an answer. It would be good if he could receive a definite
                        answer, and perhaps it might be possible tonight. He would be seeing
                        Attorney General <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> at supper
                        with the Udalls.</p>
                    <p>“The Secretary remarked it was true that we have an interest in finding a way
                        to reduce the dangers of confrontation between the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Warsaw Pact countries. He had discussed this question
                        in general terms with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> during
                        the past year. However, it was a problem related to timing to other issues.
                        The United States has not been delegated authority by the other countries to
                        negotiate a pact on their behalf. Nevertheless, we were prepared to discuss
                        the idea informally; the basis for a pact and the circumstances in which
                        such an agreement might be possible.” (Memorandum of conversation;

                        repeated the line <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had
                        taken with British Ambassador Roberts on 12 November that a certain degree
                        of understanding on such questions as German frontiers and respect for East
                        German sovereignty had been reached in talks between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the US and Britain, and that the only
                        remaining issue is the question of Western forces in West Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Soldatov recalled that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had
                        told the British ambassador that Moscow was ready to agree that the “old
                        occupation flag—which in fact serves as a screen for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>—should be replaced by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> flag.” He proposed that the Western forces
                        should be replaced by a “<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> police unit” for
                        a fixed period of time. This “police unit” should be composed of the Western
                        garrisons, plus contingents from other unspecified <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members. It should not exceed the combined strength of the
                        Western garrisons as of 1 July 1962, and would be reduced at a fixed annual
                        rate until the “unit” is withdrawn altogether at the end of four years,
                        leaving West Berlin under the protection of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> “obligations.”</p>
                    <p>Soldatov also renewed earlier Soviet suggestions that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> headquarters should be transferred to West
                        Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> also made this
                        proposal to the Canadian ambassador, claiming that the “whole world” would
                        then be the guarantor of West Berlin's freedom.</p>
                    <p>In contrast to the generally conciliatory approach to the British, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> adopted a stronger tone in his
                        talk with the Canadian ambassador. He warned that failure to reach a Berlin
                        agreement would create a “very dangerous situation” which could get out of
                        hand, and he revived the threat of a separate peace treaty with East
                        Germany. He emphasized that “Berlin is not Cuba” and that it would be
                        “dangerous madness” to expect a further Soviet retreat.</p>

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> warned that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s local tactical and strategic position
                        is vastly stronger in Berlin than it was in Cuba, and that “if people think
                        the Cuban affair will restrain us, they don't know us.” He reiterated that
                        after a separate treaty is signed, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        could and would cut Allied military access to West Berlin. He added,
                        however, that he would not repeat “Stalin's stupid mistake” in imposing a
                        blockade on civilian traffic.</p>
                    <p>In his talk with the Canadian ambassador, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> advanced stronger terms for a Berlin settlement
                        than Ambassador Soldatov outlined to Lord Home.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he “knew” that
                        British Ambassador Roberts in their 12 November talk had received the
                        impression that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would accept the
                        continued presence of Western forces in West Berlin, without the addition of
                        Soviet troops, provided they were under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        aegis rather than the existing occupation status. He denied categorically
                        that he had said this and insisted he would agree only to one of four
                        variants: (1) the addition of Soviet troops to the Western garrisons; (2)
                        replacement of the Western forces by contingents of smaller <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Warsaw Pact countries; (3)
                        contingents from neutral powers; (4) a combination of (2) and (3).</p>
                    <p>In reporting this interview to his government, the Canadian ambassador
                        commented that he could not believe that Ambassador Roberts had
                        misunderstood <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Although
                        Soldatov's definition of Soviet terms to Lord Home went beyond <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s 12 November views, Soldatov
                        did not use this occasion to “correct” Ambassador Roberts' alleged
                        misunderstanding.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had told Roberts that the
                        actual composition of the forces under the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        flag need not be a subject for dispute. He implied that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would not object to the continued
                        presence of Western forces provided an agreement is reached to place them
                        under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> authority. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> at that time did not insist on
                        adding Soviet troops to the Western garrisons and did not mention the other
                        “variants.”</p>
                    <p>The Canadian ambassador also pointed out that Soviet officials have long
                        tried to create or widen a wedge between Canada and the US and to encourage
                        a neutralist attitude in Canada. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s more demanding line probably was aimed at
                        prodding Canada into urging both the US and Britain to take a more
                        forthcoming position in the next round of Berlin negotiations.</p>

                        strengthening his post-Cuba bargaining position was also reflected in his
                        remarks to the Canadian ambassador and in renewed claims in the Soviet press
                        of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s superiority in long-range
                        strategic weapons. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s

                        of his backdown in Cuba was evident in his statement to the ambassador that
                        it was not a matter of much importance where Soviet rockets are located. He
                        contended that withdrawal of strategic missiles from Cuba did not seriously
                        affect the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s over-all capabilities and
                        that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has plenty of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s and submarines which could fire

                    <p>A Red Star article on 4 December by Marshal Biryuzov, commander in chief of

                        development of powerful rockets.” He boasted that the Soviet Union is
                        “perfecting” nuclear warheads, with yields of “50 to 60 and more megatons,”
                        which can be delivered to any point on the globe, and that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has “successfully solved” the problem of

                        protesting a West German action in bringing suit against an alleged
                        Communist-front organization before the Federal Administrative Court in West
                        Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Moscow pointed out that the Western governments agree that West Berlin is not
                        part of the Federal Republic and charged that West German authorities were
                        illegally interfering in West Berlin affairs. Although the notes contended
                        that this incident underscores the “urgent necessity” of a German peace
                        settlement, they made no mention of a separate peace treaty.</p>
                    <p>In his first public statement on Berlin and Germany since the Cuban crisis,

                        omitted all references to a peace treaty and echoed Moscow's line that
                        “dangerous disputes” must be settled through compromise. In a 2 December
                        speech to an East German party district conference, <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> adopted a moderate position and
                        placed the peace treaty question in the framework of a general East German
                        “long-term policy.” He expressed optimism that the formation of a new
                        government in Bonn may lead to negotiations and an eventual normalization of
                        relations between the two German states.</p>

                    <p>In his talk with the Canadian ambassador, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> reiterated his earlier position that no real
                        progress could be expected on disarmament prior to a Berlin settlement. The
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, however, continued to take a
                        hopeful view of prospects for a nuclear test ban agreement.</p>
                    <p>In his 28 November letter to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Khrushchev</hi> repeated the
                        proposal which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> first outlined to
                        the US on 7 November for using unmanned, automatic seismic stations to
                        police a nuclear test ban. Although the Soviet premier again rejected
                        on-site inspections regardless of the number, he suggested that these
                        seismic stations, with “elements” of international control, would provide a
                        basis for a “mutually acceptable compromise.” He repeated the offer to
                        install two or three “black boxes” in the USSR and listed three areas “most
                        prone to earthquakes” as possible sites.</p>
                    <p>Apparently judging that the British position on test-ban controls is actually
                        closer to the Soviet than to the US stand, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> probably hoped by this line to encourage
                            <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> to urge the US to relax
                        or abandon its insistence on on-site inspections in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>At Geneva, Soviet delegate <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName>
                        continued to stress the “favorable conditions” for a test ban agreement. He
                        claimed that the “black boxes” would enhance the efficiency of existing
                        national detection systems. <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName>
                        privately acknowledged that this scheme was designed to compensate the US
                        for the absence of on-site inspections. However, he took the usual position
                        in a private discussion with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAH1">Dean</persName> that “agreement in principle” on the use of the seismic
                        stations should be reached before the technical details are discussed.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> maintained its insistence on a
                        comprehensive ban on all testing. <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> rejected a Swedish proposal for an interim
                        agreement to stop underground tests, contending this would only legalize
                        such tests and give the US a military advantage.</p>

                        characterized his talks as having been useful in clarifying respective
                        positions on Cuba, Berlin, and other questions. He said the meetings left
                        the impression that a “possibility is in the offing for bringing the
                        viewpoints of the two sides closer on a number of important international
                        questions.” He agreed to further talks in New York to work out a Cuban

                    <p>We agree with many of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s observations and
                        in particular with the description of considerations affecting the Soviet
                        reaction to the Cuban crisis contained in the first third of the
                        memorandum.</p>
                    <p>However, we differ with the presentation of probable Soviet policy decisions
                        as being essentially a choice of two alternatives—a “hard” line devoted to
                        an arms buildup or a “soft” line stressing negotiations, disarmament
                        measures, and peaceful coexistence. We believe that Moscow will not choose
                        between these two approaches, but will—as it has in the past—combine arms
                        building with pursuit of its objectives through negotiation.</p>
                    <p>While the possibility of a major change in Soviet policy over a broad range
                        of issues cannot be excluded, recent evidence suggests that Soviet <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595" facs="0623"/>policy on major issues will not be
                        marked by radically new departures. The Cuban crisis appears to have added
                        weight to the arguments on both sides of unsettled questions in Soviet
                        policy, but without shifting the pre-existing equilibrium. It may well turn
                        out that in the long run the principal effect of the Cuban crisis will have
                        been to make difficult decisions even more difficult and thus add to the
                        Soviet leadership's propensity to temporize, adopt half-measures and avoid
                        taking radical decisions.</p>
                    <p>Because we do not view Soviet policy alternatives as a single hard-soft
                        dichotomy, we disagree with the estimate, in paragraph 17, that an assertive
                        US policy would unquestionably impel <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> toward a “hard” line. Obviously an aggressive US
                        policy (demanding Soviet withdrawal from Eastern Europe, for example) would
                        have that effect, and in the extreme case might even drive the Soviet
                        leaders to conclude that they had no alternative but to launch a pre-emptive
                        strike. However, more moderate displays of assertiveness on the part of the
                        West could well have the opposite effect, causing the Soviets to exert
                        greater efforts in seeking negotiations and agreements with the West. We
                        believe that the lesson of the passing of Soviet deadlines on Berlin and the
                        withdrawal of missiles from Cuba is that, despite his sensitivity to
                        appearing weak, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will show
                        prudence in response to a policy which is assertive without being
                        provocative.</p>
                    <p>The reasoning in paragraph 18 likewise suffers from posing the Soviet policy
                        alternatives as a hard-soft dichotomy. Soviet misinterpretation of our
                        motives in offering considerable concessions is not apt to bring about a
                        return of Soviet policy to a harder line, since the concessions might well
                        appear to obviate a need for the harder line.</p>

                    <p>On December 15, 1962, <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> published a lengthy
                        article on the espionage activities of Colonel Oleg V. Penkovsky, in which
                        four officials at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow were implicated. In commenting
                        on the article the Embassy reported that such a “broadside public attack”
                        was “unprecedented in recent times,” speculated on the motivation for it,
                        noted that the capacity of the Embassy to function normally could not fail
                        to be affected, and asked the Department of State to consider a formal
                        protest to forestall the further exacerbation of the situation. (Telegram
                            <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0624"/>1516 from Moscow, December 15;
                        Department of State, Central Files, 121.613/12-1562) The Department of State
                        replied the same day advising against a protest and leaving to the Embassy
                        the final decision on whether the U.S. officials should leave the Soviet
                        Union. (Telegrams 1285 and 1287 to Moscow, December 15; ibid.)</p>
                    <p>On December 25 the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked the Acting Deputy
                        Chief of Mission to come in at 3 p.m., but shortly before that time called
                        back to postpone the meeting for a day because it was Christmas. (Telegram
                        1580 from Moscow, December 25; ibid., 121.613/12-2562) On December 26
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMN1">Mikhail N. Smirnovsky</persName>, Head of
                        the American Division of the Foreign Ministry, referred to the article (and
                        others) in the Soviet press and stated that the Ministry expected the
                        Embassy to take immediate measures for the strict observance by its
                        employees of the norms of diplomatic conduct. The Acting Deputy Chief of
                        Mission replied that the United States rejected all the charges as unfounded
                        and stated that the Soviet press seemed to be carrying on an anti-American
                        campaign that was incompatible with high-ranking assurances to Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> that the Soviet Union
                        wanted to increase understanding between the two countries. (Telegram 1582

                    <p>On December 19, 1962, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, in a letter to the President, noted his
                        government's acceptance of automatic seismological stations as part of the
                        verification process for a nuclear weapons test ban. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then referred to a proposal he
                        alleged had been made by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAH1">Dean</persName> in a conversation with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> on October 30,
                        specifying that the U.S. would be content with two to four on-site
                        inspections a year to supplement the stations. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> indicated that he would be agreeable to two to
                        three on-site inspections a year. <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> replied
                        December 28, stating he was “encouraged that you are prepared to accept the
                        principle of on-site inspections” but demurring on the number of
                        inspections. <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> contended that <persName corresp="#p_DAH1">Dean</persName> had said that eight to ten would be
                        necessary. Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>,
                        in a letter of January 7, 1963, reasserted his willingness to accept two or
                        three annual inspections. He also agreed to <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s
                        suggestion that a Soviet delegation meet with a U.S. delegation to review
                        technical problems associated with the negotiations. For texts of the

                    <p>Joined by a delegation from the United Kingdom, the United States and Soviet
                        delegations met 10 times between January 14 and 31, 1963. The discussions
                        produced no progress, and the Soviets terminated the talks saying they would
                        continue negotiations in the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee. The
                        President announced postponement of a series of underground nuclear tests
                        while the technical talks were underway but began the series on February 8
                        after the conclusion of the talks. Between that date and June 25 the United
                        States carried out 29 test shots. For more information, see <ref target="frus1961-63v07">

                    <p>Marie and I were asked to dinner December 28 with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. We found it was a party of
                        six—his wife, and Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Zinchuk (Counselor).</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was obviously engaged in a
                        fishing expedition. With a none too well concealed interest, he asked me
                        leading questions, such as “Didn't I agree that the Administration was
                        divided between those who wanted to make progress after Cuba in U.S.-Soviet
                        relations, and those who wanted to wait and see what develops. Which of
                        these courses is the President likely to follow?” I countered by telling him
                        a few things which I thought would be useful, one, I felt sure that the
                        President had been shocked by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s abuse of the term “defensive weapons.” He
                        caught my point without my having to drive it home. I said that he should
                        not try to guess what was in the President's mind by whom he heard was
                        seeing him or attending meetings. The President asked people <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0626"/>to attend meetings (outside the normal
                        State and Defense officials) not only to get their advice, but also to make
                        certain groups feel that they were being consulted. There was only one
                        exception to this, an individual whose advice I could assure him the
                        President was always ready to listen to, and that was Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert Kennedy</persName>. He commented that <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert Kennedy</persName> was always blunt and direct
                        (obviously indicating respect).</p>
                    <p>He asked me about different people, <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Adlai
                            Stevenson</persName> among others. I assured him that <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Adlai Stevenson</persName> would remain at the United
                        Nations as long as he wished. He was of great value to the President, would
                        always loyally carry out the President's decisions. In reply to his question
                        as to how the Saturday Evening Post article could have happened, I said I
                        knew that such a thing couldn't happen in the Soviet Union, but it was not
                        unusual in the United States for newspapermen, even friends of the
                        President, to speculate inaccurately. Dobrynin said that he had noticed the
                        emphasis the President placed in his press conference<note n="2" xml:id="d275fn2">For a transcript of the President's press conference on

                        intention to keep his friends.</p>
                    <p>He asked whether <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> represented
                        the business and banking group and I said I considered <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName> represented no one but himself.
                        However, he had the respect of a great many people, Democrats as well as
                        Republicans, businessmen and bankers. He then commented “We find him frank,
                        objective and have confidence in his statements.”</p>
                    <p>He appeared surprised when I told him things weren't going very well in Laos,
                        and contended that we should give more time for the three groups to get
                        together. I told him that was all very well, but when the North Vietnamese
                        didn't live up to the Agreement, action must be taken, and he could be sure
                        that before long we would be asking the Soviet Government and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> specifically to make good their
                        promise to police the “socialist” Geneva participants.</p>
                    <p>He asked me a number of questions about my experiences with Stalin, and what
                        I thought of him. These I answered quite frankly. In this, he gave me the
                        feeling that he was sincerely interested or at least curious. He commented
                        that I was the only one in the U.S. Government who had had close contact
                        with Stalin and now with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.
                        He said that Stalin had grown more and more suspicious in the last years of
                        his life even of his close associates.</p>
                    <p>He asked whether we agreed to the neutrality of Cambodia. I replied “of
                        course” but explained details of Sihanouk's proposals were beyond our power
                        to guarantee (the unsettled border of Cambodia with Thailand and South
                            Vietnam).<note n="3" xml:id="d275fn3">For text of Prince <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s letter to President

                        such sweeping guarantees. I told him we would consider the matter and
                        comment shortly. He said Soviets had reservations also and pointed out
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s reply “agreed in
                        principle.”</p>
                    <p>He then asked me why I had changed my position in my talks with Pushkin <note n="4" xml:id="d275fn4"> Georgi M. Pushkin, Soviet Deputy Foreign

                        changed—it was Pushkin. As I recalled it, in August 1961 Pushkin had
                        indicated to me his interest in stopping the fighting in Viet Nam. When,
                        however, I discussed it with him again in October or November of '61, he had
                        changed his tune. Both <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and
                        Zinchuk said, “Oh, but it was in January '62 when he raised the question
                        again and you had showed no interest.” I said I didn't recall Mr. Pushkin
                        giving me any indication that the Soviet Union was prepared to arrive at a
                        practical solution. Dobrynin said, “But of course, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName> would have to go.” I said, “Well who
                        is better than <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Diem</persName>?”, and I added
                        that when Pushkin had made the same statement, I had suggested <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> ought to be replaced; that ended
                        that aspect of the talk.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether we were
                        imposing any conditions on Nehru. I said if he meant alignment the answer
                        was “no.” In fact we were not imposing any conditions on our military aid.
                        Nehru and all of India understand the danger coming from Peiping, but we had
                        no objection to Nehru and the Indian Government maintaining good relations
                        with the Soviet Union. I said, “If you are a friend of India, why didn't you
                        try to stop Chinese aggression by threatening to end shipments of <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>?” He rather slyly intimated that they had
                        used their influence and this had something to do with the Chinese
                        withdrawing their troops.</p>
                    <p>He wouldn't be led into any informative comment on the row between Moscow and
                        Peiping. I told him that we obviously thought that it was important for
                        India and Pakistan to make up their differences in order to live as friendly
                        neighbors. It was obvious Peiping was opposed to this and I assumed Moscow
                        wouldn't be any more cooperative. He denied this.</p>

                    <p>On January 7, 1963, Representative to the United Nations Stevenson and Soviet
                        First Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetzov submitted a joint letter to United
                        Nations Secretary-General U Thant that signaled the end <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0628"/>of negotiations for a mutually agreeable
                        resolution to the Cuban missile crisis. The letter stated in part: “While it
                        has not been possible for our Governments to resolve all the problems that
                        have arisen in connexion with this affair, they believe that, in view of the
                        degree of understanding reached between them on the settlement of the crisis
                        and the extent of progress in the implementation of this understanding, it
                        is not necessary for this item to occupy further the attention of the
                        Security Council at this time.” For text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v11">

                        to other issues, specifically German peace treaty and disarmament. In latter

                        <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> thanked the Secretary for
                        the opportunity of seeing him. He said that the Secretary, of course, knew
                        why he had been sent here by Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. After two and a half months the talks on the
                        Cuban situation in New York had concluded and it was therefore considered
                        useful for him to meet the Secretary now. At his meeting with the President
                            yesterday,<note n="2" xml:id="d278fn2">See footnote <ref target="#d277fn1">1, Document 277</ref>.</note> the President had
                        expressed the opinion that while the results of the New York talks had not
                        been everything which might have been desired, the text of the joint letter
                        to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretary General<note n="3" xml:id="d278fn3">See <ref target="#d276">Document 276</ref>.</note>
                        <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0630"/>did represent progress. The
                        Secretary interjected that both the President and he appreciated the genuine
                        effort <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> had made to achieve
                        agreement in New York. <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName>
                        replied that the United States representatives had also been very expert and
                        frank, expressing U.S. positions very clearly. The resulting general
                        atmosphere had been business-like and this was encouraging.</p>
                    <p>Looking back to the end of October, <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> continued, we may say that an important conclusion
                        should be drawn in order that we might move ahead and that U.S.-Soviet
                        relations will be even better. He had agreed with the President's statement
                        that relations between the two countries should be good. The important
                        conclusion which clearly emerges from the crisis is that when our two mighty
                        powers display sincere efforts to reach agreement on important problems
                        affecting the fate of mankind, they can agree. During the crisis
                        constructive steps had been taken by the Soviet Government and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in his exchanges with the
                        President. The President had also taken constructive steps and as a result
                        agreement was reached which permitted a solution to the crisis. This very
                        important circumstance had been noted in Moscow. But with this, it is worth
                        saying that it took only five days to agree to avert thermonuclear war but
                        two and a half months to agree on a document reflecting the essence and
                        spirit of the basic agreement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> said that he wished to
                        stress that the role of our two countries is outstanding as the whole world
                        recognizes. It is, therefore, important to try over and over to improve our
                        relations and to combine our efforts for the solution of bilateral and
                        international problems in the interests of maintaining and consolidating
                        peace. The Soviet Government agrees with the President that now that the New
                        York negotiations have been concluded, the way has been paved to a certain
                        extent to give more attention to other international problems. With regard
                        to our relations, there is still something to do and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is not satisfied with the present status.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has made quite clear
                        the sincere desire of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to do
                        everything possible to improve relations in order to remove obstacles in the
                        path to the betterment of relations and then to unite our efforts to solve
                        other problems. The Secretary probably realizes, Kuznetsov said, that the
                        relations between us play an important role in international affairs and the
                        world situation depends to a great extent on our relations. Kuznetsov said
                        he had no particular problems in mind but believed the Secretary knew what
                        they were. He did mention that our economic relations, specifically trade,
                        are unsatisfactory and that our cultural relations, although some results
                        have been achieved in this field, could be still further improved. The
                        Soviet Government would like to do its best to clear away obstacles.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he was very interested in <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName>'s views. We are interested in improving our
                        relations, as the President said. We do <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0631"/>not doubt that the President and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> bear very heavy historical
                        responsibilities in this phase of world history. Both men understand this.
                        This is one reason why the President had sought to maintain effective
                        channels of communications between us. But the historical importance of our
                        relations for good or ill makes us feel we must maintain effective
                        communications channels and not just in the physical sense. The Secretary
                        observed that when he became Secretary he had not dealt with Soviet affairs
                        for some 10 years. He has observed one noticeable difference between the two
                        periods inasmuch as it was now possible to talk with some degree of
                        understanding across the ideological gap which separates us. One of our
                        great problems, the Secretary said, is that we must recognize our very
                        important ideological differences. We both try to understand our differences
                        and we must also try to enter into the other side's thinking. There was
                        still much to be done in this area.</p>
                    <p>Twelve to 14 years ago, the Secretary observed, he had talked with Yakov
                        Malik <note n="4" xml:id="d278fn4"> Yakov A. Malik, Soviet Deputy Foreign
                            Minister, 1946-1953.</note> in New York and had agreed with him to talk
                        about what each did not like about the other's policy. We should try to
                        explore genuine common interests objectively considered and attempt to
                        establish real communications with each other. While he had been speaking
                        about the general subject of communications, the Secretary said he also
                        wished to talk about the problem of physical communications. Recently the
                        United States Government had offered to establish on a reciprocal basis
                        radio transmitters in the Embassies in Moscow and Washington. For the United
                        States this represented simply a desire to improve our technical
                        communications with our Embassy. Rapidity of communications is a matter of
                        joint interest. The Secretary noted that the Soviets have two leased lines
                        to the United States whereas we have none to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> said that he did not know
                        the details of this problem but promised to take it up upon his return to
                        Moscow. With regard to the Secretary's comments on the general spirit of our
                        relations, <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> asserted that
                        people in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> live in a magnificent
                        and happy period. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is a
                        very real man who knows the spirit and thoughts of the rank and file. He is
                        a most devoted fighter for good relations between our two countries and for
                        the maintenance and consolidation of peace. Your President, therefore, has a
                        good partner, <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> said, and you
                        were lucky that you had <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> as
                        the head of the Soviet Government in October.</p>
                    <p>However, there are some groups in the U.S. who were not interested in having
                        good relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. This is not
                        the case in the Soviet Union so that the U.S. has more difficulty in this
                        sense than does the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. It is important
                        not to look backward in the search for peace. Unfortunately, such tendencies
                        do exist in the U.S. and it is up to the United <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604" facs="0632"/>States Government to handle this situation. Sometimes even
                        United States officials show signs of this pressure. For example, in
                        December at a press conference the Secretary<note n="5" xml:id="d278fn5">For
                            a transcript of <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s press
                            conference, December 10, 1962, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> December 31, 1962, pp. 994-1001.</note> had said
                        that the system in Cuba was inconsistent with Western Hemispheric ideals.
                        This sentiment reflects backward views and impressions.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary opined that it might be well for the two Foreign Offices to
                        make up a group of four or five people, yours to try to think like Americans
                        and ours to try to think like the Soviets. As for his December 10 press
                        conference, the Secretary noted that the President had stated a year and a
                        half ago that there were two points in regard to Cuba which were not
                        negotiable: its political-military alliance with an outside power and
                        interference in the internal affairs of other countries.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> observed that mutual
                        understanding was very important but asked the Secretary whether he did not
                        think that at this stage each side understood something about the policies
                        of the other. Ideological differences cannot be solved. However, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> freely admits that even in the light of
                        this basic difficulty we can solve important problems in the interest of
                        peace and humanity. United States official policy is based on the
                        understanding that a country's social system is not part of its legal
                        system. In the United States there is a theory that the Western Hemisphere
                        is a special place which should only be bound by the ideals now found there.
                        Not everyone will agree with this, <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> said. The situation in Latin America is not so
                        ideal that it does not require change. Indeed, many governments in the
                        Western Hemisphere seek change. The Soviet Union wishes for friendly
                        relations with other countries, especially the United States, and it does
                        not wish ideology to interfere.</p>

                    <p>At the end of his conversation with the Secretary,<note n="2" xml:id="d279fn2">See <ref target="#d278">Document 278</ref>.</note>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> observed that U.S.-Soviet
                        trade had just about dried up. The Secretary replied that there were two
                        problems in connection with this trade, one being a trade problem in that
                        the Soviets merely buy samples while the other is a political problem.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> rejoined that he understood
                        the political problem but disputed the Secretary's charge that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> only bought samples. He handed the
                        Secretary a report which had been prepared for him by Amtorg on the state of
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-US trade relations. The report
                        made the following points:</p>
                    <p>1. The United States Department of Commerce had stated that from October 23,
                        1962 no more licenses would be issued for the export of American goods to
                        the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. According to the press this
                        ban was of a temporary nature only. However, even before the adoption of
                        this decision the Department of Commerce had been holding up applications
                        for licenses on goods ordered by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
                        Since 1961 the Department of Commerce has issued licenses for only 10% of
                        the total sum of Soviet orders.</p>
                    <p>2. In September 1962 a cargo of Soviet-owned sugar was detained in Puerto
                        Rico. In October 1962 a Federal court in San Juan determined that the sugar
                        was the property of an agency of the Soviet Government. However, the local
                        court in San Juan did not release the detained cargo <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0634"/>and the ship sailed from San Juan in
                        November, having left 15,000 tons detained by the American authorities.</p>
                    <p>3. The Longshoremen's Labor Union of the Atlantic Coast Mexican Gulf
                        instituted in October 1962 a boycott on handling Soviet cargoes and ships
                        which formerly used to call at Cuban ports. As a result many Soviet cargoes
                        have not been unloaded, including the personal luggage of Soviet citizens.
                        These actions by the Union inflict material damage both to Soviet and
                        American trading firms and individuals and call for action by the American
                        authorities.</p>

                        acute differences with Peiping which are weakening and demoralizing the
                        international Communist movement. He called for a cessation of polemics and
                        for patience and moderation in discussing these differences.</p>
                    <p>This line may be primarily a tactical maneuver to prove that the Chinese are
                        solely responsible for the disarray in the Communist movement if they
                        continue, as Khrushchev may expect, to attack Soviet leadership and
                        strategy. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s restraint,
                        however, could also reflect heavy pressures on him from other bloc and
                        foreign Communist leaders to avoid carrying the conflict with the Chinese
                        and Albanians to an open and avowed break.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Proposals for a Conference</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>A pause such as <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has
                        requested had become necessary if the Soviet leader was not yet prepared to
                        face up to the consequences of a <pb n="607" xml:id="pg_607" facs="0635"/>break. The increasingly open and aggressively direct accusations which
                        they were trading in their propaganda media, if continued, would have
                        brought about a showdown guaranteed to split the movement asunder. This
                        development was causing serious concern in Communist parties around the
                        world, and their leaders, some Soviet and some Chinese supporters, expressed
                        that concern by proposing the convocation of some form of international
                        conference.</p>
                    <p>Both the Chinese and the Soviets had reprinted these proposals in their
                        press, but continued their attacks on one another. As late as 15 January,
                        the opening day of the East German congress, the Soviet bloc press,
                        including <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>, contained bitter criticism of the
                        Albanian and Chinese views and leaders. Within these attacks, however, was
                        the anguished cry from foreign Communist parties for unity—a unity which the
                        other side was threatening by its unwarranted actions.</p>
                    <p>The difficulty arises in the differing definitions of what form an
                        international conference should take and under what rules it should be
                        convoked. The Soviet Union, supported by a majority of the Communist
                        parties, favors reaching conclusions on the basis of majority rule. The
                        Chinese, encouraged by the successes they scored in the last international
                        conference, want one that would arrive at resolutions on the same basis as
                        previously—that of unanimity.</p>
                    <p>A recognition of the difficulties in arranging for a congress was indicated
                        in the proposals made by Togliatti and Indonesia's Aidit.<note n="3" xml:id="d280fn3"> Palmiro Togliatti, Italian Communist Party Secretary,
                            and Aidit Dipa Nusantara, leader of the Indonesian Communist Party
                            (PKI).</note> Both had suggested that a conference should be called, but
                        each had noted that preparations for such a conference would be long and
                        drawn out. Togliatti recommended bilateral meetings as the first stage in
                        the process. The Italian and Chinese parties have already agreed to meet and
                        discuss their sharply opposing views. Aidit's suggestion included a
                        reference to the necessity for careful preparation which might take place
                        “over a year or two” before a conference. Both the Soviet and the Chinese
                        press had reprinted this line.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> gave implied endorsement
                        to such proposals, urging that no meeting take place until the polemics
                        cease and “people have a chance to cool down.” He noted that a meeting now
                        would “entail the danger of a split,” since “fighting has a logic of its
                        own, and political passions can reach a boiling point.”</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The future course of the dispute will depend greatly on the line taken by the
                        Chinese delegation to the East German congress. The practice has been to
                        have the Chinese speak directly after the Soviet speaker at <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0636"/>bloc party congresses. At the East German
                        congress, however, Poland's <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>
                        followed <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and echoed the
                        moderate line taken by the Soviet leader. This apparent change in procedure
                        may have been requested by the Chinese so that they might have time to
                        assess the significance of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s unexpected ploy and to prepare their response. It
                        might also have been stage-managed by the Soviet supporters so as to
                        demonstrate to the Chinese that they intend to agree to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s request for a moratorium in
                        the polemics.</p>
                    <p>If the Chinese respond to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        in kind, the result will be a sharp reduction in the direct attacks on one
                        another. Differing assessments of strategy and tactics, however, will
                        continue. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, himself, gave a
                        spirited defense of Soviet views on peaceful coexistence, the nature and
                        effects of nuclear war, his handling of the Cuban crisis, and the proper way
                        for a revolutionary party to come to power. The dispute will clearly
                        continue but on the higher and more “principled” plane that Communists are
                        fond of requesting.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Continuing Search for Support</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Both sides will continue to drive for support from other Communist parties.
                        One of the tactics which the Soviet Union was using during the two weeks
                        immediately preceding the congress was to demonstrate the strength of the
                        support which existed in the Communist world for its positions. The Soviet
                        press devoted an unusually large portion of its pages to reprinting the
                        speeches and resolutions of other Communists which condemned the positions
                        of the “dogmatists.” The Chinese engaged in a similar by-play.</p>
                    <p>Peiping's continuing effort to mobilize support was also evidenced by the
                        arrival in Peiping since the first of the year of leading Communists from
                        New Zealand, Indonesia, and Japan. The Chinese are also trying to win over
                        important factions in parties such as the Ecuadorean, where the controlling
                        leaders are Soviet-oriented. Both sides are vying for support from North
                        Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>A pause in the exchange of polemics between the two sides will not bring a
                        comparable pause in this type of activity. Although Khrushchev has moved to
                        reduce the escalation of the open dispute for the moment, it is almost
                        certain that developments from both within and without the Communist world
                        will revive more direct attacks on one another.</p>

                    <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0637"/>
                    <p>In his address, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> contended
                        that, although four years have passed without the signing of a peace treaty,
                        the bloc had achieved important gains. He cited the Berlin wall as “a most
                        important step” in strengthening East German sovereignty and said the peace
                        treaty is “no longer the problem it was before the protective measures” in
                        Berlin were taken.</p>
                    <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> had told the congress
                        the day before that the Soviet premier would report on the Soviet-US talks
                        on Berlin, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> ignored this
                        subject. He confined himself to repeating the latest Soviet proposal for
                        placing Western forces in West Berlin under the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> flag “for a certain period of time.”</p>
                    <p>The current line in Soviet propaganda and press media reinforces the view
                        that Soviet leaders envisage a continued hiatus in talks on Berlin until
                        they feel strong enough to resume serious negotiations. A public lecturer in
                        Moscow on 15 January emphasized the settlement of outstanding differences
                        through negotiations and stated that “it would be foolish to renounce
                        negotiations” so long as both sides continue to demonstrate interest in
                        talks. And in his 10 January discussion with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, Deputy Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> asked the US to come up with new
                        proposals on the German question.<note n="4" xml:id="d280fn4">See <ref target="#d278">Document 278</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>In his own address before the congress on 15 January, the East German party
                        boss also was moderate in his elaboration of the Berlin problem. He even
                        omitted several sharp anti-US passages which appeared later in the printed
                        version of his address. <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>—to
                        make recent Soviet proposals more palatable to party
                        functionaries—represented the formula under which Allied forces would remain
                        in West Berlin under some form of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> aegis as
                        only the first step in a “gradual settlement” of the Berlin problem. He
                        insisted that any solution would have to respect East German control over
                        the access routes.</p>

                    <p>While <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is in East Berlin,
                        Soviet representatives have been exploring the possibilities of arranging a
                        meeting between him and West Berlin Mayor Brandt. According to an official
                        of the West Berlin Senat (city administration), Soviet Embassy officials in
                        East Berlin suggested on 14 January that Brandt come to see <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. A formal invitation from
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was issued on the

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could exploit any such meeting in

                        asserted in his congress speech, “an example of peaceful coexistence between

                    <p>The Secretary said he had asked the Ambassador to come in in order to express
                        his surprise that the Soviet Government had decided, with inadequate
                        consultation, to publish three of the letters exchanged between the
                        President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d281fn2">On January 19 <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had called <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> and then gone to his home around 4 p.m. to say
                            that, because of the publicity in the American press about talks in New
                            York on a test ban agreement, the Soviet Union had decided to publish
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s letters to
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> of December 19, 1962, and January 7,
                            1963, and the President's letter to the Chairman, of December 28. (For

                            At 5 p.m. <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> informed
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> of the conversation and
                            suggested that the Secretary of State call in the Ambassador and tell
                            him that he was “terribly disturbed” by the publication. (Department of
                            State, Rusk Files: Lot 72 D 192, Telephone Conversations) A memorandum
                            of Thompson's conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> is in the <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> Library,
                            National Security Files, Countries Series, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> Talks.</note> The Secretary said we considered
                        it important that the President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> maintain a channel in which they could talk
                        privately. There was a wide gap in the ideology of the two countries which
                        made it difficult to reach understanding on important questions without
                        getting involved in our ideological differences.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary also pointed out that he did not wish to argue the point
                        unduly, but confidence between the two men had recently received a shock
                        which underlined the importance of their being able to remove
                        misunderstanding through private communications. The Secretary expressed the
                        hope that we could assume that the publication of these letters would not
                        constitute a precedent with regard to private communications exchanged
                        through this channel. There were other ways in which exchanges of a more
                        public nature could be conducted, but he stressed the importance that one
                        side should not decide unilaterally on publication of private exchanges, but
                        that this should only be done on the basis of joint discussion.</p>
                    <p>In reply, the Ambassador said he had no specific instructions, but he was
                        sure his Government considered these private exchanges valuable. <pb n="611" xml:id="pg_611" facs="0639"/>In this particular case, not a single word
                        had been published in the Soviet Union or said by their statesmen. These
                        exchanges were handled there cautiously and very few people in Moscow knew
                        about them. When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName> had
                        discussed the postponement of the resumption of disarmament talks with him,
                        he had urged that <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> be
                        instructed not to say anything about the New York talks, and both he and
                        Fedorenko <note n="3" xml:id="d281fn3"> Nikolai T. Fedorenko, Soviet
                            Ambassador to the United Nations.</note> had been instructed not to say
                        anything. Then, within eighteen hours, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName> had proposed a communiqué.<note n="4" xml:id="d281fn4">For text of the communiqué, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1963</hi>, pp.
                            942-943.</note> While the text of the communiqué was not particularly
                        objectionable, this appeared to be a sudden change of line on our part.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary pointed out that in view of press speculation, we had tried to
                        avoid reference to the exchange of letters.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> pointed out that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName> had made reference to the
                        negotiations on television, whereas there had been no word from the Soviet
                        side. He also pointed out that Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had previously had occasion to complain about
                        references in our press to correspondence between him and the President.
                        There had been exact statements quoted from the Chairman's letters, although
                        not printed as quotes.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he could understand Moscow's viewpoint, but that nothing
                        had been said here about the test ban talks that referred to the letters.
                        From time-to-time reporters could guess and write speculative stories. We
                        had tried to divert attention from the exchange of letters. It had been
                        necessary to say something in view of the press speculation. He was glad to
                        hear that the Soviet side considered that these exchanges should be
                        private.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary mentioned that a Soviet Ambassador in another country had made
                        references to these exchanges, indicating that the Soviets had virtually

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he was
                        virtually certain that no Soviet Ambassadors were being informed about these
                        exchanges, although it was always possible that if one visited Moscow, he
                        might pick up some information.</p>
                    <p>The discussion then turned to the question of timing of the release of the

                    <p>On January 22, 1963, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                        met with the National Security Council. According to notes of his remarks,
                        he stated the following regarding Cuba: “The time will probably come when we
                        will have to act again on Cuba. Cuba might be our response in some future
                        situation—the same way the Russians have used Berlin. We may decide that
                        Cuba might be a more satisfactory response than a nuclear response. We must
                        be ready—although this might not come. We should be prepared to move on Cuba
                        if it should be in our national interest. The planning by the US, by the
                        Military, in the direction of our effort should be advanced always keeping
                        Cuba in mind in the coming months and to be ready to move with all possible
                        speed. We can use Cuba to limit their actions just as they have had Berlin
                        to limit our actions.” For text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v11">

                    <p>Three days later, at a meeting of the Executive Committee of the National
                        Security Council on January 25, Ambassador at Large Thompson expressed his
                        opposition to several proposed courses of action against Cuba, including an
                        instruction that would prohibit the shipment of U.S.-owned goods on Free
                        World ships engaged in the Cuba trade. According to the summary record of
                        the meeting, <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> “thought we
                        should act toward Cuba in such a way as not to provoke a reaction from the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, particularly during the current
                        period when we are seeking to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty and when
                        we do not yet know what will flow from the split between the Chinese
                        Communists and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.” Furthermore, “he
                        feared that if we implemented the proposed shipping orders, we might delay
                        the withdrawal of Soviet troops still in Cuba.” Director of Central
                        Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> and Secretary of
                        State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> both expressed doubts that
                        the Russians would remove their troops. “We must assume that the forces
                        there are going to stay,” stated <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>,
                        and therefore “the risk of delaying Soviet troop withdrawal was not great.”
                        At a meeting of the NSC Executive Committee on February 5, the President
                        approved the shipping order. For text of the summary record of both

                            hoped to reach a test ban agreement that would clear the way for a

                        Communications. During general exchange with which we began discussion,
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> said US and Sov Govts
                        were now talking with each other, in contrast to Stalin period. Perhaps this
                        conversation was not always as pleasant as we would like it to be, but at
                        least we were talking. Even during acute situations, negotiations can help
                        solve problems.</p>
                    <p>I said President believes, more than any other man I have ever known, in
                        value of communication. Despite rather unhappy Vienna meeting, he continued
                        believe in communication. As result Cuban crisis, President had come to
                        conclusion we do not have rapid enough means of communication between our
                        two govts. We had consequently made proposal for (1) direct teletype line
                        from Moscow to Western Europe, which would speed our communications as do
                        two teletype lines Sov Govt has running into New York, and (2) establishment
                        radio stations in Embassies. I hoped we could quickly agree on this.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> merely said he was familiar

                    <p>I said I realized this and had merely wanted to mention it to him in context

                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s 19 December letter,
                        which reverted to Moscow's acceptance up to November 1961 of the principle
                        of on-site inspections to enforce a ban on underground testing, was
                        dispatched one week after he had publicly unveiled his latest proposal for a
                        Berlin accommodation. These moves to demonstrate the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s desire for a resumption of meaningful
                        negotiations with the West were apparently prompted by concern that the
                        outcome of the Cuban crisis might result in a shift in US policy toward the
                        more unyielding posture favored by President <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> and Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> in dealing with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In his letter, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> told
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was ready to “meet you half way” by
                        agreeing to two or three on-site inspections a year. Since November 1961,
                        Moscow had adamantly opposed such inspections, insisting that existing
                        national detection systems were adequate to control a ban on tests in all
                        environments. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> also
                        repeated his earlier offer to establish three unmanned, automatic seismic
                        stations in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He contended that the
                        present moment is “eminently suitable” for a test-ban agreement and that
                        this would facilitate negotiations on disarmament and other international
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s latest “concession” had
                        been foreshadowed by private remarks of Polish and Rumanian diplomats who
                        hinted in late November and mid-December that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might put forward a proposal combining automatic seismic
                        stations with a small number of obligatory on-site inspections.</p>
                    <p>In the bilateral Soviet-US talks in New York between 14 and 18 January,
                        Soviet representatives took a very restrictive approach, contending that the
                        discussions should focus exclusively on the number of on-site inspections
                        and the number and locations of automatic stations. They maintained that the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would accept no more than two or
                        three inspections annually and three seismic stations.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> took a
                        pessimistic view of the New York talks in a private discussion with
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> on 18 January. He
                            <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615" facs="0643"/>complained that the US had not
                        correctly evaluated <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        letters and that it continued to insist on an unacceptable number of
                        inspections and seismic stations.</p>
                    <p>Soviet disarmament negotiator <persName corresp="#p_TSK1">Tsarapkin</persName> also told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAH1">Dean</persName> on 21 January that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would not drop his rejection of the US concept of
                        nationally manned control stations under international supervision. He said
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had 73 such stations which would
                        report to an international commission but that international supervision
                        over their operation was out of the question.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> also raised another obstacle
                        to a test-ban agreement by stating publicly on 21 January that an agreement
                        is impossible without the adherence of France. Insistence on this condition,
                        which was advanced by Moscow in November 1961, would be tantamount to
                        deliberate stalling in view of President <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s long-standing refusal to associate France with the
                        test-ban negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Soviet propaganda, however, has greeted the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> exchange as bringing
                        a test-ban agreement nearer than ever before in the past two years and as
                        paving the way for the solution of the “entire” disarmament problem.</p>

                        Moscow's desire to hold the door open for a resumption of the Berlin
                        dialogue. He repeated several times that the Soviet leaders are operating on
                        the assumption that the US continues to favor further Berlin talks.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> displayed sensitivity to
                        Western speculation that recent bloc pronouncements had removed the urgency
                        from the Berlin problem. He warned that such a conclusion would be a great
                        mistake. Although he urged that talks should be renewed soon, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> added that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would not set a deadline for their
                        completion or for a peace treaty because this would “complicate” the
                        question for both sides.</p>

                    <p>Soviet propaganda last week revealed Moscow's satisfaction over the strains
                        in the Western alliances. Moscow cited President <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s rejection of the US Polaris missile offer and
                        his opposition to Britain's entry into the Common Market as evidence of deep
                        differences within the Western camp. Soviet commentators contrasted
                        President Kennedy's “rosy” description of the Atlantic alliance in his

                    <p>Beneath this ill-concealed pleasure over rifts in the Western world, however,
                        were signs of Moscow's concern that recent events may accelerate West
                        Germany's acquisition of a nuclear capability. Soviet comments on Chancellor
                            <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>'s visit to Paris charged
                        that <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De Gaulle</persName> needed Bonn's support
                        in building an independent nuclear force and implied that the French
                        President, in return, would be willing to take an elastic view of the 1954
                        agreements prohibiting West German possession of nuclear weapons. Soviet
                        Deputy Foreign Minister Malik, in a talk with a Western diplomat, took the
                        line that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> would support
                            <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s rejection of
                        Britain's membership in the Common Market since Bonn's only hope of
                        obtaining nuclear weapons was through cooperation with the French.</p>
                    <p>Moscow greeted the impasse between France and Britain on the Common Market as
                        providing much-belated confirmation of traditional Communist dogma regarding
                        the inevitable antagonisms among capitalist states. <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi> declared that the increasingly “acute and complicated”
                        relations among <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners “shows once
                        more that inherent in this bloc are the same features which characterized
                        every imperialist grouping.” Moscow forecast an “extremely bitter struggle
                        for markets” among the Western powers.</p>
                    <p>Soviet propaganda claimed that the Common Market impasse proves that the
                        formation of “exclusive economic blocs” is not the way to stimulate world
                        trade. It recalled <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        proposal for an international trade conference. Moscow also alleged that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s plan for US
                        cooperation with the Common Market has proved to be “founded on sand.”</p>

                        proposing the resumption of bilateral discussions on Berlin: “Soviet

                        might be resumed; it contained no substantive points. “Soviet Government

                    <p>1849. On assumption we may now move toward nuclear test ban agreement and in
                        light <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s January 26 initiative
                        on Germany/Berlin<note n="2" xml:id="d286fn2">See <ref target="#d285">Document 285</ref>.</note>—particularly final remark re
                        consideration to be given to “Procedure and means for definitive approval”
                        of agreements reached—I suggest we should ourselves do some advance planning
                        regarding procedural as well as substantive aspects talks with Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Following are a few preliminary thoughts, which might be discussed further
                        during my visit to Washington.</p>
                    <p>On whole I see no concrete indication <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is maneuvering toward summit meeting on basis
                        possible test-ban agreement alone. Believe Soviets realize that, however
                        dramatic tripartite signature would be, many steps would remain, such as
                        ratification and efforts secure adherence others. However, Soviet summit
                        initiative cannot be excluded in this case, and above-cited language with
                        respect to <gloss target="#t_GB1">G/B</gloss> is clear that Soviets have
                        summit in mind in this connection.</p>
                    <p>In order forestall any Soviet maneuver in first case and provide basis for
                        orderly procedure if progress should be made in second, suggest possibility
                        US initiative at appropriate stage which would comprise proposal that
                        nuclear test-ban treaty be signed at Geneva by Foreign Ministers with
                        concurrent indication that Secretary would be prepared, following signature
                        ceremony, to visit Moscow pursuant to repeated suggestions by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in course his many unreciprocated
                        visits to Washington.</p>
                    <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0646"/>
                    <p>Atmosphere at time of test treaty signature would perhaps be appropriate for
                        such visit. Signature of itself, however, is obviously not end of road even
                        in [garble], well-defined and limited, area of our relations with Soviet
                        Union or broader East-West relationship, since complicated and extended
                        matter of implementation will probably be beset with many difficulties.
                        Meeting at level higher than Foreign Ministers, therefore, would tend to
                        cast achievement attained in false and exaggerated light.</p>
                    <p>Visit of Secretary would serve constructive purpose of affording opportunity
                        to investigate post-treaty prospects in Soviet foreign policy without
                        encouraging undue public optimism as to concrete results of visit and
                        without built-in implications which are always present in meetings of heads
                        of state and government. Additionally, Secretary might well conduct further
                        phase discussions on <gloss target="#t_GB1">G/B</gloss> in light of any
                        talks held meanwhile in Washington or Moscow.</p>
                    <p>If test-ban treaty should be agreed upon and US ratification appeared
                        assured, and if prospects were clearly in view for agreement on modus
                        vivendi on <gloss target="#t_GB1">G/B</gloss> acceptable to US, then
                        consideration might be given to possibility final acceptance and approval of

                    <p>At a meeting on February 5, 1963, with Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Director of Central Intelligence
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> stated that “if the
                        Soviets wished merely to control <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> and to maintain Cuba as a base for infiltrating Latin
                        America they could do so at much less cost and with much less provocation
                        than the present program.” <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>
                        “therefore warned that in his opinion we could expect a more ominous
                        situation relative to Cuba—perhaps the introduction of offensive weapons
                        again.” In a message to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, February
                        13, <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> reiterated his “growing
                        concern over the possibility of reintroduction of an offensive capability in
                        Cuba.” For text of <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>'s

                    <p>On March 13 <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> reported at a
                        meeting of the National Security Council “that Soviet troops were
                        withdrawing from Cuba,” but “because <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0647"/>there appears to be no movement of major items of military equipment, we
                        do not know whether the Soviet troop withdrawal to date has actually
                        affected the Soviet military capability in Cuba.” For text of the summary
                        record, see ibid., pages 715-718. During a discussion with <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> on March 26, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> stated “that he had once felt that
                        the Soviets would withdraw all of their forces from Cuba, but that he had
                        now reached the conclusion that the plan had changed.” <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> responded that the indicators as to
                        Soviet intentions were conflicting. Certain information “would lead one to
                        the conclusion that a gradual and continuing withdrawal would take place,”
                        probably over “the balance of the year.” On the other hand, the “building of
                        permanent installations and the arrival of undisclosed but apparently
                        sophisticated equipment” supported a conclusion “that the Soviets were there
                        to stay, but perhaps on a somewhat reduced scale.” For text of <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>'s memorandum of discussion, see

                    <p>On February 7, 1963, Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> made an oral presentation to Secretary of State
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> on non-proliferation. He
                        again expressed opposition to any multilateral agreement giving Germany
                        access to nuclear weapons: “The Soviet Government deems it necessary to
                        declare again that transfer of nuclear weapons to the West German armed
                        forces irrespective of the manner in which this is carried out would greatly
                        complicate and aggravate the situation in Europe. The world would be
                        confronted with a new danger and the Soviet Union naturally would be
                        compelled to take all the ensuing measures.” <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s statement continued: “The Soviet Government deems
                        it necessary to state that if the U.S. Government actually proceeds with
                        proliferating nuclear weapons to other states participating in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the number of states possessing
                        nuclear weapons is increased the Government of the Soviet Union will be
                        compelled to draw from this necessary conclusions and will respond in kind,
                        that is, will see to it that appropriate countries friendly toward the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will receive nuclear weapons.” In
                        responding <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> emphasized that the
                        multilateral arrangements which the United States was considering would not
                        increase the number of nations which could fire nuclear weapons. If the
                        Soviet Union wished to make similar arrangements with its allies, the United

                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He noted that prior to his recent
                        return to Moscow, he had not been stationed there in 13 years. This
                        intervening period permitted him, upon his return, to view the local scene
                        in a more dispassionate way since his previous experiences in Moscow had
                        become so conditioned and affected by day-to-day frustrations and
                        exasperations. The changes which have occurred in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> these 13 years are upward in
                        nature—slowly but steadily. The evolution in the development of the Soviet
                        society during this period is remarkable. The physical changes are quite
                        evident—the people are better dressed, there are more automobiles on the
                        streets, etc. The atmosphere is far more relaxed and the air of pervading
                        fear is gone. The era of waiting for the dreaded knock on the door in the
                        night and the ever-packed suitcase is gone. There is a very striking ferment
                        throughout Soviet society. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> warned that all he referred to is relative to the
                        situation under Stalin, and that it does not in any sense reflect a
                        situation approximating that in any democratic nation. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has no intention of relaxing
                        controls to such an extent, and the Soviet Union is a highly controlled
                        closed society. However, people are now free and willing to talk to
                        Americans. The number of such exchanges with the U.S. diplomatic community
                        has increased by a factor of ten over previous years. We know more about
                        what is going on since people seek us out to talk.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> must rely on the party for
                        control and that the Army is under party control. However, the basis of
                        power is spread throughout various centers in the country. It is not
                        strictly controlled in Moscow as under Stalin. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> does not possess the power to make tough
                        decisions in the center and make them stand up to the degree that Stalin
                        did. A good example is his recent crackdown <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0649"/>on art and literature. People are fighting back against
                        this decision publicly. The artists and writers may lie low for awhile but
                        they will not change nor will they cease their activities.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that he, like
                        many others, was surprised by the Soviet miscalculation in Cuba. He noted
                        that there had been much speculation on the reasons for the Soviet move in
                        Cuba as well as the manner in which it had been arrived at. These included
                        guesses that it was a move forced by the military or that it was solely a
                        political decision by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that these
                        speculations on Soviet aims and possible internal differences are not
                        justified or important. What is important is the very real relief shown by
                        the Soviet leadership at the peaceful settlement of the Cuban problem. The
                        whole structure of Soviet leadership was shocked to the core by being taken
                        to the brink of war. They did not like what they saw and experienced, and
                        they had absolutely no stomach for a showdown. This was unmistakable and
                        their relief was real and genuine in every respect.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that he is not
                        altogether certain where we stand in the aftermath of Cuba. The Soviets have
                        indicated a desire to reopen talks on Berlin, they have pursued a campaign
                        to picture <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> as a man of
                        peace, and they have extended the doctrine of peaceful co-existence. They
                        probably are looking and hoping for some relaxation. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that he did not expect any
                        early Soviet move against Berlin. After Cuba the Soviets talked about Berlin
                        but they did not take any initiative. For our part, we have also avoided
                        taking any initiative. Two weeks ago the Soviets made, by implication, the
                        most serious approach to us on Berlin that they have made since November,
                            1958.<note n="3" xml:id="d289fn3">See <ref target="#d285">Document
                                285</ref>.</note> The Ambassadorial Group is now studying this
                        approach.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that there are
                        limits on what we may expect in any easing of the Cuban situation. U.S.
                        domestic pressures and public criticism will make it difficult for the
                        Soviets to reduce their presence and activities in Cuba without severe loss
                        of face. Soviet troubles with the ChiComs and their lack of success in
                        geographical expansion in other areas through peaceful means will require
                        them to maintain a militant position toward Castro. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might have relaxed his pressures
                        and activities in Cuba if he had been given more time. However, U.S.
                        domestic pressure now has him on the hook. On the other hand, the Soviets
                        feel they have a pretty good case in Cuba. If we threatened strong action
                        against the USSR in Cuba now, we certainly could not expect to get the
                        backing we got the first time around.</p>
                    <p>General LeMay asked how the Soviets are reacting to the Sino-Indian conflict.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> replied that it has
                        given the Soviets a <pb n="622" xml:id="pg_622" facs="0650"/>real solid
                        headache. They have floundered around and swayed on the tightrope they have
                        tried to walk. They have also tried to support both sides. The Indian
                        Ambassador in Moscow has been pushing the Soviets hard and he has achieved
                        some success. He has gotten more out of the Soviets than was to be expected,
                        particularly in the provision of <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>
                        aircraft. The <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> deal means little or
                        nothing militarily, but it has profound political and psychological
                        significance. The provision of military aid by a communist country to the
                        active foe of another communist country is an unheard of act. It is almost
                        impossible to get Soviet leaders to discuss any aspect of the matter. The
                        actual depth of the Sino-Soviet split is a question mark. It does not appear
                        that the Soviets are attempting to formalize it. However, there is a real
                        struggle underway at present among the Communist Parties and we do not have
                        much information on the nature or details of this fight. The possibility of
                        a hard split is a real one. It is obvious that the Soviets will not share
                        economic wealth or resources with the ChiComs. It is also quite apparent
                        that the Soviets will not permit the ChiComs to get them embroiled in a
                        conflict with the U.S. except on <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> terms
                        and under <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> controls.</p>
                    <p>General LeMay asked if the Soviets will attempt to take advantage of the
                        present political difficulties existing in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>
                        said that while they would attempt to gain some propaganda advantages, they
                        would not pursue any serious course of action. First, they have serious
                        difficulties within their own camp and second they take a far more jaundiced
                        view of the Franco-German accord than we do. The Soviets believe that
                            <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> is using De Gaulle and
                        manipulating him to his own ends. They believe that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> persuaded <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De Gaulle</persName> to veto <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> entry into the Common Market. However, there is no prospect
                        of a Paris-Moscow accord. This does not appear to be in the cards.</p>
                    <p>General LeMay asked what importance the Soviets give to Africa and how they
                        feel about their present position in that continent. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that the Soviets have priority
                        objectives and great aspirations in Africa and have devoted a great deal of
                        effort and resources to accomplishing them. They appear disappointed in
                        their relative lack of success to date. This failure also tends to disprove
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s theory of peaceful
                        victory through economic and political penetration. African diplomats in
                        Moscow have indicated that the Soviets are disillusioned over the relative
                        lack of success they have had in Africa, particularly in view of the high
                        hopes they had at one time. The suppression of Communist Parties in various
                        African nations has been a setback they did not expect. Their greatest
                        disappointments have come from developments in Egypt, Morocco, Mali, Guinea
                        and Ghana. The lack of progress in Africa probably increases Soviet
                        determination to hang on to their present position in Cuba.</p>
                    <pb n="623" xml:id="pg_623" facs="0651"/>
                    <p>Admiral Ricketts <note n="4" xml:id="d289fn4">Admiral Claude V. Ricketts,
                            Vice Chief of Naval Operations.</note> asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> to give his views on ultimate Soviet
                        objectives in Cuba in the aftermath of the missile withdrawals. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that the situation
                        changes as circumstances alter. However, the Soviets essentially regard Cuba
                        as a base, as a toehold and a platform for various activities. The Soviets
                        are somewhat worried over their position in Cuba as a result of their
                        differences with <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>. They find his
                        adoption of the ChiCom line to be a burdensome problem. He demanded a very
                        high economic price from them and they are paying it. On the one hand they
                        keep troops in Cuba because they distrust Castro and on the other hand their
                        troops are used to support him. In summary, the Soviets have real problems
                        in Cuba and they are following a holding operation for the present.</p>
                    <p>Admiral Ricketts then asked how Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> viewed current Soviet-Yugoslav relations. The
                        Ambassador replied that the view from Embassy Moscow is not the same as that
                        from Embassy Belgrade. From Moscow, it appears that Tito won a total
                        victory—this does not coincide with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KGF1">Kennan</persName>'s view but that is the way it appears from Moscow.
                        Tito gave only a little, if at all, and he gained a great deal. He may end
                        up with observer status in the Common Market as well as in the Bloc
                        organization. The present state of affairs would appear to justify Tito's
                        policies and should enhance him as an example to the leaders of satellite
                        nations. He, in effect, is having the best of both worlds with no loss of
                        freedom. The implications of this will not be lost on <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>.<note n="5" xml:id="d289fn5">

                        Nam and if so, what his probable reaction would be to the application of
                        U.S. pressure on Hanoi. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> replied that he could not be specific on this
                        question but he did feel that two general considerations ruled Moscow's
                            <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> policy. First, Moscow did not wish
                        to see the ChiComs win the present struggle among the Communist Parties in
                        the area. Second, Moscow prefers to keep a relative calm in the area and
                        desires to prevent any ChiCom actions which would involve them in open
                        conflict with the U.S.</p>
                    <p>General LeMay asked how the Soviets had reacted to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> proposals and the planned removal of
                        Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> stated that the Soviets had given
                        factual reporting to the Jupiter withdrawals and had not attempted to link
                        them with Cuba. Just last night they had made representations to Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.<note n="7" xml:id="d289fn7">See <ref target="#d288">Document 288</ref>.</note> This move was to be
                        expected in addition to standard news treatment and various other personal
                        approaches. The Soviets are <pb n="624" xml:id="pg_624" facs="0652"/>anti-anything which even implies possible German involvement with nuclear
                        weapons. They feel that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is a step in
                        this direction. However, they are far more afraid of a German-French
                        bilateral than they are of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. If given
                        a choice they would greatly prefer the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        to a real hard Franco-German accord. They are opposed to the Common Market
                        for many reasons, not the least of which is the fact that it is not in
                        keeping with their economic and political theories. If faced with an
                        effective Common Market, the Soviets would prefer to see the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> as a member in order to offset to a degree
                        the German role in the organization. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> asked if the Soviets would take any hard steps against
                        the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that they probably would not.
                        They know that it is a long way from being a reality and, accordingly, no

                    <p>On February 8, 1963, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                        met with key advisers on U.S. test ban policy. According to Atomic Energy
                        Commission Chairman Seaborg's record of the meeting, Arms Control and
                        Disarmament Agency Director Foster stated that “the key to any test ban is
                        underground tests because the detection of the other types is easy and not
                        at issue.” Further, he “said he would like to have authority to go
                        eventually to six on-site inspections as a fall-back position.” Commenting
                        that he thought six on-site inspections “the rock-bottom position,”
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> “said we should

                        will cheat, and then work out the advantages, that is, compare what they
                        might gain by cheating with the advantages that banning tests would have
                        with respect to the Chinese situation.” <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> added
                        that “the whole reason for having a test ban is related to the Chinese
                        situation. Otherwise, it wouldn't be worth the disruption and fighting with
                        Congress, etc.” For text of Seaborg's record of the meeting, see <ref target="frus1961-63v07">

                    <p>On February 17 the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency circulated a paper
                        recommending U.S. positions at the test ban talks in Geneva. The next day
                        the President discussed the paper with the Committee of Principals, and
                        inspection procedures were agreed on. For more information and text of

                    <p>I had luncheon on February 8 and a two-and-a-half hour talk alone with Soviet
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. Following are

                    <p>Embassy Housing. I assured Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that the State Department would do everything
                        possible to help him in connection with his plans to acquire new housing in
                        Washington. At the same time I mentioned to him my own plans to get new

                    </p>
                    <p>Nuclear Non-proliferation. We had a long discussion on this subject along the
                        lines of the Secretary's conversation with him on February 7.<note n="3" xml:id="d291fn3">See <ref target="#d288">Document 288</ref>.</note> We
                        agreed that our interest in this subject was a common one and I argued
                        strongly that our own plans for a multilateral nuclear force were the best
                        way to forestall the growth of pressures in Germany for an independent
                        nuclear capability or a possible Franco-German deal on this subject. I
                        expressed my skepticism about the threat in his démarche to the Secretary
                        that the Soviet Union would share its nuclear weapons with its <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0654"/>own friends. He did not directly reply but
                        did say that they did not want either of us to do any sharing.</p>
                    <p>Cuba. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he realized
                        the Cuban question was poisoning the atmosphere of our relationship but that
                        frankly he was at a loss as what to advise his Government.<note n="4" xml:id="d291fn4">In a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on February 9, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> twice repeated the comment that <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> had made to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> the previous day, that Cuba
                            was “poisoning” U.S.-USSR relations. Rusk indicated that the United
                            States had “no desire or intention to invade Cuba” but that a “wholly
                            unqualified commitment” depended “on the attitude of the Cuban
                            Government.” <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> also emphasized
                            that the continued presence of Soviet troops in Cuba “contributes to the
                            heightened tensions in our relationship.” For text of the memorandum of
                            conversation, see <ref target="frus1961-63v11">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961-1963, vol. XI</ref>,
                            pp. 696-698.</note> He sometimes had the feeling that even if they
                        abandoned Cuba entirely and even helped our overthrow of <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>, some people in the United States
                        would charge that it was too little and too late. I told him I could not
                        discuss this in detail. However, I pointed out to him the President's
                        problem in this respect and the efforts the President was making to restrain
                        the emotions connected with this question. I gave him the personal opinion
                        that it would be very helpful if there could be well publicized photographs
                        in the papers every week or so of Soviet ships leaving Cuba with Soviet
                        military personnel obviously visible on the decks.</p>
                    <p>Nuclear Tests. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> apparently
                        felt optimistic about our reaching agreement on a nuclear test ban
                        agreement. At the same time he made it clear that the Soviets would
                        contemplate the signing of such an agreement as an appropriate occasion for
                        a meeting between the President and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. I argued that this would be premature since the
                        ratification process would still lie ahead in the United States and the
                        charter members would be committed to solicit other adherents. I expressed
                        the opinion that the ratification process would be complicated here since
                        under our system the Senate could charge that the President by dramatizing
                        the signature was taking Senate ratification for granted and abrogating
                        their function. I therefore thought it would be much better that any meeting
                        should follow the accomplishment of ratification and hopefully could take
                        place at a time when other problems could then be dealt with successfully by
                        the Heads of Government.</p>

                    <p>a) US treats pipe over 19 inches as having military and strategic

                        on various occasions in the past the Department has called the Embassy's
                        attention to impermissible activities carried on by officials of the Soviet
                        Embassy and Amtorg. He recalled his conversations with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMN1">Smirnovsky</persName> on this subject August 9, 1961
                        and December 21, 1961 and referred to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJC1">Guthrie</persName>'s discussion on this question with Mr. Filippov on

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRH1">Davis</persName> said that the Department is
                        seriously disturbed by the continuing intelligence activities of a number of
                        Soviet Embassy and Amtorg officials and employees, activities which continue
                        in spite of repeated warnings in the past. He observed that the only
                        apparent effect of the US warnings seems to have been the shifting of some
                        of these activities from Amtorg to Embassy officials. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRH1">Davis</persName> cited as Soviet officials
                        particularly flagrant in improper activities Mr. G.A. Nikolaev of Amtorg,
                        Mr. B.S. Petrikovski, an employee of the office of the Embassy's Commercial
                        Attaché, and Embassy Third Secretary A.V. Kuznetsov. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRH1">Davis</persName> stressed that we are aware of
                        improper activities by a goodly number of other Soviet officials and that
                        the three persons mentioned were those whose activities have been especially
                        bad. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRH1">Davis</persName> said that we are
                        asking that such activities be stopped.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Kornienko asked if he had correctly understood Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRH1">Davis</persName> to say intelligence activities. After
                        receiving Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRH1">Davis</persName>' affirmative
                        response, Mr. Kornienko stated that he could not accept this kind of
                        accusation since he knew that the Soviet Embassy and other Soviet
                        establishments in this country are not involved in any “unofficial”
                        activities. He would, of course, report Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRH1">Davis</persName>' comments to his Embassy and the government of the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He repeated that, as far as he
                        personally was concerned, he absolutely could not accept “that kind of
                        accusation.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRH1">Davis</persName> said that on our part we
                        consider that our knowledge of these activities was conclusive, that our
                        sole interest is that these improper activities cease and that we do not
                        intend to give publicity to our warning. Mr Kornienko said that he had
                        nothing to add but repeated that he would bring the matter to the attention
                        of his Embassy and government.<note n="2" xml:id="d293fn2">Following this

                            also discussed plans for new U.S. and Soviet Embassy buildings in Moscow

                        and North Vietnam was still using Laotian territory as an infiltration route

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Norman</persName> Cousins came in to give me
                        an interesting account of his visit to Moscow and his discussions with
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in December 1962.<note n="2" xml:id="d295fn2">For another account of the visit, see Cousins,
                                <hi rend="italic">The Improbable Triumvirate</hi>, pp. 32-57.</note>
                        The following is the substance of his report:</p>
                    <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0658"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Cousins</persName> had been invited by the
                        Vatican to undertake a private mission to Moscow in order to put certain
                        questions to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> on behalf of
                        the Vatican. [Here follow 5-1/2 paragraphs on <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Cousins</persName>' mission for the Vatican.]</p>
                    <p>Upon arrival in Moscow he saw <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> during a very busy week but was given
                        considerable time (I had the impression of two hours by the Chairman). When
                        Cousins remarked to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that
                        he, the Chairman, had had a very busy week the Chairman said that, in
                        political life, such weeks were like a lady's corset—“It was necessary to
                        have them from time to time in order to stay in shape but it felt very good
                        when you could take them off.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> spoke at some length about
                        Russian affairs. He claimed that Soviet industry was showing an encouraging
                        twenty per cent overproduction in terms of the Plan and that he felt that
                        major gains were being achieved. He affirmed that there was a genuine crisis
                        in agriculture and that agricultural norms had been missed by a wide margin
                        and that much remained to be done. He said that they were trying to work out
                        some means by which responsibility could be decentralized to the “action
                        level” and to shake off the paralysis of undue centralization. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> expected the Communist Party to
                        be the “mind and eyes” of the people and to take the action necessary in
                        local situations to produce results in accordance with the demonstrated
                        desires of the people concerned. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that they were borrowing from capitalism the
                        notion of incentives and that the Soviet Union would be placing more and
                        more emphasis upon personal incentives in order to get on with the job. In
                        discussing de-Stalinization, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> commented that it was necessary to shift from the
                        highly centralized and ruthless regime of Stalin to a dimension of
                        responsibility to all those who are in a position to take action. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that the difference between
                        Lenin and Stalin was that Lenin forgave his enemies but Stalin killed his
                        own friends.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Cousins</persName>, on instruction from the
                        Vatican, made the point to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        that the Vatican was very upset by the distortion which Soviet propaganda
                        had given to the statements made by the Vatican during the week of the Cuban
                        crisis. If the Soviet Union thought that these statements represented any
                        basic movement away from the West toward the Soviet Union or any revision of
                        the Vatican's attitude toward genuine co-existence this was a great mistake.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> responded that some of
                        his own journalists “don't know how to handle good news”. He said that he
                        has constant difficulty with his own propaganda machine because they respond
                        in a doctrinaire fashion where a more pragmatic attitude would be more
                        productive.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said to <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Cousins</persName> that he knew full well that he would
                        not convert the Pope to Communism and that the Pope would not convert <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0659"/>him to Catholicism. But he added,
                        “But stranger things than this have happened.” [Here follows another
                        paragraph on the Vatican mission.]</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then asked <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Cousins</persName> to see <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName>. Cousins replied that he had seen <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> two days before whereupon <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he ought to see him
                        again—implying that the Chairman had had some discussion with <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> since <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Cousins</persName> last saw him.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Cousins</persName> then saw <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> who said that “the Chairman has to
                        have some results for his policy” of attempting to find some agreement with
                        the West. <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> said that unless
                        the Chairman can show some results there would necessarily be a major change
                        in the Soviet attitude. He said that he was not saying this to <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Cousins</persName> as a threat but simply as a
                        statement of the political facts of life in the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> thought that there were three
                        fields in which some real progress might be possible: (a) nuclear testing;
                        (b) Berlin; (c) outer space. <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName>
                        thought that cooperation in outer space was in pretty good shape and was on
                        the tracks. On nuclear testing he insisted that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was convinced that his agreement to three on-site
                        inspections and three automatic seismic stations would fully meet the United
                        States requirements. <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName>
                        referred, for example, to his own conversation with Dr. Weisner <note n="3" xml:id="d295fn3"> Jerome B. Wiesner, Special Assistant to the President
                            for Science and Technology.</note> and claimed that Dr. Wiesner had said
                        that two or three on-site inspections would be all that would be required.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> said that Soviet leaders
                        had been deeply disturbed about President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s rejection of the 3-3 proposal and felt that they
                        had been hoodwinked.</p>
                    <p>On Berlin, <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> said that the only
                        remaining question of any importance was the presence of American forces in
                        West Berlin. He said that it was necessary for us to help <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to “save face” by accepting a
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> flag over Western forces in West
                        Berlin. I questioned Cousins specifically about whether <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> had used the phrase “save face” and
                            <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Cousins</persName> insisted that <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> had in fact done so.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Cousins</persName> concluded the conversation by
                        saying that he would be returning to the Soviet Union and would be in touch
                        with me in the event that I had anything I wished to say before he
                            went.<note n="4" xml:id="d295fn4">For <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Cousins</persName>' account of his second trip to the Soviet Union

                        new formal renunciation of use of force. Sovs may hope nonaggression pledge
                        would embarrass Western response to pressure on Berlin.</p>
                    <p>3. Sovs apparently believe that public discussion European security topics at
                        this time will spur questioning of Western defense arrangements and
                        contribute to differences among allies. Tabling of nonaggression treaty on

                        refurbished versions other European disarmament schemes such as
                        denuclearization (possibly including new emphasis on Balkans), troop
                        withdrawals, and possibly prevention of surprise attack.</p>
                    <p>4. In context <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>, tabling draft treaty and
                        declaration on bases suggests Sovs intend use Geneva as platform for
                        propaganda attacks on Western defense arrangements. Draft documents may be
                        designed in part to draw attention away from exclusive focus on test ban
                        issue at Geneva, <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0661"/>although even if
                        this supposition accurate move does not shed light one way or another on
                        Soviet intentions with regard to test ban.</p>
                    <p>5. Soviet move may be intended to remove nonaggression pact from context of
                        talks on Berlin, and may reflect Soviet effort to narrow range of issues to
                        be discussed in any new round of Berlin conversations in order to press for
                        agreement on status, troop-presence and access questions.</p>
                    <p>6. Soviet draft treaty bears strong family resemblance to earlier Soviet
                        draft treaty language. Most notable difference is duration clause which is
                        not specifically tied to conclusion of general European security treaty.
                        Though new draft would not preclude re-introduction of Soviet proposal for
                        such pact, it suggests Sovs prepared to let that idea lapse.</p>

                    <p>I continue to be concerned over the objectivity with which our analysts and
                        estimators appraise the developments in Sino-Soviet relations. It is of
                        interest to me that press, radio and TV commentators all seem to interpret
                        various actions by the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists as indicating
                        some effort towards rapprochement and reconciliation. In fact some reporting
                        has been very optimistic—probably greatly overstated—on the prospects for
                        reconciliation. On the other hand, the tone of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> reporting as evidenced by this morning's item on
                        Sino-Soviet relations,<note n="2" xml:id="d298fn2">Not further
                            identified.</note> indicates to me that our analysts continue with the
                        conviction that no reconciliation is possible and that new steps in the
                        controversy are in preparation.</p>
                    <p>A reconciliation or a suspension of the hostility that we have witnessed for
                        the past year or so would have a very considerable effect on our vital
                        interests. It would, for instance, permit the Soviets to take more
                        aggressive action against the West with a confident feeling that they were
                        not exposed dangerously on their southeastern border. Likewise, Sino-Soviet
                        relationships would affect importantly such matters as the India-ChiCom
                        controversy, nuclear testing, disarmament and other current problems.</p>
                    <p>I raise this question because I feel we must study the indicators with great
                        care and great objectivity and not be influenced by a preconceived
                        conclusion in this matter. It appears to me that it is in Khrushchev's
                        interest to find a reconciliation and, with the ChiComs hard-pressed
                        technologically and economically, it might be in their interests to “make
                        up”, even at the cost of setting aside some of their basic ideological
                        positions.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he would inform SovGovt

                        reply. He said <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> obviously considers that
                        threat to cut off export of pipe by certain countries to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would sabotage Soviet economic
                        development. Such calculations were groundless. This could in no way weaken
                        Soviet economic potential. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had brought
                        pressure on <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, which had in turn brought
                        pressure on its industrialists, some of whom had specially constructed
                        facilities to supply <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> with pipe. Latter
                        were forced to refuse export pipe to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
                        Only <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> industrialists would suffer from
                        this, not <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Calculations that Soviet
                        economic potential would be weakened or that it would be damaged were
                        founded on nothing. It was, rather, a question of principle for <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that when <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> meets with President, Soviets
                        hear statements from American side that US is striving for international
                        cooperation, and US reps say same sort of thing in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and other international bodies on cooperation in economic,
                        political, and cultural fields. At same time, US applies gross pressure to
                        stop trade with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, in crude
                        contradiction to those statements. It was hard to reconcile these two
                        things: US statements about improving US-Soviet relations and pressure to
                        force certain countries to stop trade with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in peaceful products, “and I emphasized peaceful.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said SovGovt categorically
                        protested this. That was why he had taken advantage of my trip to Washington
                        to bring this to my attention so I could transmit it to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Referring to statement that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would
                        “continue to keep all aspects this question under consideration,” <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said this was not clear to him.
                        SovGovt hoped there would be substantive change in situation. <pb n="636" xml:id="pg_636" facs="0664"/>This sentence sounded as though situation
                        could go on this way for number of years, while US continued keep it under
                        consideration. He would be grateful if I could clarify this sentence.</p>
                    <p>I said I could. I said our attitude was not directed against Soviet economic
                        potential, but concerned strategic goods of military significance. I said we
                        had restricted list of such goods, which does not affect normal trade. Nor
                        could I accept contention that US had pressured other countries. These
                        countries had made their own decisions. It was of course true that matter
                        had been discussed in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. I noted I was
                        not accustomed to hearing that US had pressured <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, since usual accusation was that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had pressured US.</p>
                    <p>Specifically as regards his query, I said that two matters we had discussed
                        thus far (i.e., Berlin/Germany<note n="4" xml:id="d299fn4">For a report on

                        Soviet Government is reluctant to grant our Moscow Embassy a leased teletype
                        line or permission to use a radio transmitter. Soviet reasons may include
                        the probable loss of foreign exchange and fear that a radio transmitter or
                        leased line could enhance our Embassy's cryptographic security.</p>
                    <p>In a telephone call to the Department Bromley Smith inquired about the
                        possibilities for pressure against Soviet interests in the United States in
                        the communications field.<note n="3" xml:id="d300fn3">A record of this
                            telephone conversation, February 26, is in Department of State, Central
                            Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</note> As far as the Department can discover, the
                        U.S.S.R. has only two vulnerable points. The U.S.S.R. Mission to the United
                        Nations leases a teletype line to Moscow from <gloss target="#t_RCA1">RCA</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> in New York does
                        the same. The Soviet Embassy in Washington does not lease a teletype line
                        but probably sends at least a portion of its communications over the line
                        leased by <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Some weeks ago, the Department undertook informal consultations with the
                        Federal Communications Commission in an effort to determine some appropriate
                        method of acting against these two <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-leased lines. These consultations suggested that the
                        legislative authority available to the F.C.C. provides ample authority to
                        require an American common carrier to revoke leased circuit privileges under
                        conditions similar to those now existing, even though the carrier is
                        required by its public tariff to make such facilities available to any
                        subscriber. Consequently, on February 8 the Department addressed to the
                        Commission a letter proposing “that the Federal Communications Commission
                        take such steps as are feasible and necessary to condition the license of
                        all international United States carriers so that they, upon notification by
                        the Federal Communications Commission, are authorized to deny service and
                        facilities to any foreign government which does not provide, upon request,
                        equivalent <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0666"/>treatment and facilities
                        to the United States Government as is provided to them in this country by
                        the United States carrier.”<note n="4" xml:id="d300fn4">Not found.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Commission considered the Department's request and directed its staff to
                        prepare an appropriate rule to implement that request. Such a rule has now
                        been prepared by the Commission's staff. It is intended to consult with the
                        affected carriers as soon as possible in order to avoid any possible
                        misunderstanding and to secure their maximum cooperation.</p>
                    <p>As soon as the authority is available, the Department has in mind bringing
                        indirectly or informally to the Soviet Government's attention the
                        possibility of retaliation against the teletype lines leased by <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss>. It seems possible that this
                        implied threat of retaliation may lead the Soviet Government to grant a
                        leased teletype line to our Moscow Embassy, it is also quite possible that
                        the Soviet Government will continue to refuse.</p>
                    <p>In the latter event, the Department would wish to reexamine the situation
                        carefully before actually involving retaliation. Action against the <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> line would undoubtedly result in loss of
                        the teletype lines now leased in Moscow by at least two United States news
                        agencies. Action against the line leased by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might well create
                        complications with the United Nations. Moreover, it seems unlikely that the
                        U.S.S.R. would give way before direct threat on an issue where the position
                        is strong and where it does not have anything vital to lose. It also seems
                        undesirable for us to retaliate in unconnected fields, because US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations are too important and
                        potentially dangerous to be complicated for a relatively minor issue. If we
                        reach that point, the President may wish to consider the possibility of a
                        personal communication to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>

                    <p>With reference to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>'s
                        cable (attached), I think there is indeed some possibility that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is in some trouble at home. I
                        think it unlikely that this could be serious enough to lead to his removal,
                        although this cannot be excluded, but it is probably serious enough to mean
                        that he will have to be circumspect in his actions during the next few
                        months.</p>
                    <p>The concrete signs are few, and all of them could have other explanations;
                        for example, the mildness of his campaign speech,<note n="3" xml:id="d301fn3">For text of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s February 27 speech see <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi>, February 28,
                            1963.</note> in the light of the vicious Chinese attack upon him. The
                        nature of the Chinese attack on him, personally, must mean one of two
                        things—either the Chinese think there is some prospect of bringing about his
                        downfall eventually, or, they think that there is no prospect whatever of
                        patching up their quarrel with the Russians. Another indicator may be the
                        steps taken by some prominent military figures recently to emphasize that
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s role in the Battle
                        of Stalingrad was chiefly that of a morale-builder, rather than a military
                        strategist. The probable explanation of this is that the military are
                        building a backfire against the possibility of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> again unilaterally cutting back ground
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>It is well to remember that throughout his Administration, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has taken a number of bold
                        actions which although they have, in general, had broad appeal to the
                        masses, have adversely affected influential segments of the regime. Among
                        these might be mentioned those adversely affected by the abolition of the
                        machine tractor stations, military elements who resent Party control,
                        professional members of the Secret Police, the partisans of those who have
                        been purged during the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        era—particularly <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName>,
                        professional educators and members of the Soviet elite who resented the
                        educational reform, members of the Leningrad party setup who resent
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s obvious <pb n="640" xml:id="pg_640" facs="0668"/>preference for the “southerners,” the
                        members of the disbanded industrial ministries, the old-line Party
                        apparatchiki who resent both <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s internal and external policies, the
                        intellectuals who resent the continuance of Party control, the Jewish
                        community who are aware of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s anti-Semitism, the industrial managers and
                        technicians who resent the degree of responsibility given the Party for
                        managing the economy, the Stalinists in the Party who are gradually being
                        eliminated, large segments of the youth who resent the slowness in adapting
                        the regime to modern times and, probably most importantly, large numbers of
                        middle and lower Party professionals who are likely to be adversely affected
                        by the recent decision to bifurcate the Party organization into industrial
                        and agricultural committees.</p>
                    <p>In all, this makes a rather formidable group, and when viewed in the light of
                        Soviet reverses over Cuba and the split with Red China, must mean a fairly
                        high degree of dissatisfaction with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s leadership. Offsetting this, is the fact that
                        the Presidium and, to a large extent, the Central Committee are packed with
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> followers.</p>
                    <p>There was some indication in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s campaign speech that his problems were
                        beginning to get him down when he referred to his pleasure at renewing his
                        faith by contact with the people. Probably the biggest problem facing
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is how to deal with
                        the agricultural problem and maintain Soviet goals in other fields. His
                        success or failure in dealing with this problem could well determine his
                        ability to maintain his leadership.</p>

                    <p>On March 5, 1963, Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> composed a memorandum for the file
                        summarizing his discussions with Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
                        Director Foster during the previous two weeks on the question of a test ban
                        treaty. He noted that Foster had indicated, in response to his questioning,
                        that under certain circumstances the Soviets could test underground and be
                        free of detection. Therefore, <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>
                        wrote, he told Foster he could not support the treaty and, although he would
                        not oppose it since doing so would not be consistent with his position as
                        part of the President's administration, he wanted Foster to understand the
                        position he had taken before Congressional committees and in public
                        speeches, press conferences, and TV appearances, occasions on which he had
                        “called for the suspension of only <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0669"/>those tests which could be reasonably verified.” <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> also noted that he had reviewed his
                        position with President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and
                        expressed his doubt that the Senate would approve such a treaty, a view in
                        which the President concurred. For text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v07">

                    <p>In an April 8 memorandum, apparently for the record, <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> expressed similar reservations
                        about the verification process but continued: “Of greater importance,
                        however, is the fact that under present political circumstances a test ban
                        between the U.S. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would not, in the final analysis, answer the
                        ‘proliferation’ problem because the Soviets cannot handle the Chinese
                        Communists and we and the British cannot handle the French.” For text, see

                    <p>2310. I. There seems to us to have been an unmistakable change in the Soviet
                        posture during the past six weeks, in particular a drawing back from the
                        forthcoming attitude toward East-West problems which followed the Cuban
                        crisis and lasted roughly through my talk with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on January 26,<note n="2" xml:id="d304fn2">See <ref target="#d285">Document 285</ref>.</note> prior to my departure for
                        Washington consultations. The major factor is certainly Moscow's
                        preoccupation with the Chinese Communist problem, in the light of the
                        unexpectedly (to Moscow) violent nature of the ChiComs' open opposition to
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s “peaceful
                        coexistence” policies and of the increasingly obvious failure of those
                        policies to produce results in terms of Communist objectives. Moscow
                        apparently feels that no accord (test-ban, Germany/Berlin, risk-of-war
                        measures) is in prospect with the West which would not aggravate its
                        difficulties, with the ChiComs and be vulnerable to latter's attacks.
                        Resultant doldrums (if not actual chill) in East-West relations seems likely
                        to persist at least until Soviet leadership decides how to deal with ChiComs
                        and starts to do so. This clearly is now priority subject for consideration
                        and debate within leadership here (though we know of no factual basis for
                        rumors of serious opposition to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, which are, in any case, recurrent Moscow
                        phenomenon). Process may well be lengthy and outcome presently
                        unpredictable.</p>
                    <p>II. Following are principal factors leading us to these conclusions:</p>
                    <p>1. Since my return, I am no longer serenaded by Soviet post-Cuba theme song
                        of need to move ahead toward solution of outstanding East-West problems by
                        “compromise” and “mutual concessions”. Instead I am assailed by accusations
                        United States not interested in settling problems, which by well-known
                        Soviet thought-process of inversion, would indicate loss of interest on
                        their part.</p>
                    <p>2. Soviets are not only standing pat on test ban and deprecating disarmament
                        possibilities but are adopting dilatory tactics on Germany/Berlin, on which
                        they but recently took initiative.</p>
                    <p>3. Evolution of Bonn-Paris axis with its implications in military and
                        political fields is causing anxiety and even evoking repeated references in
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s recent speeches to
                        “complicated nature” of international situation—a surprising statement from
                        the No. 1 exponent of historic determinism.</p>
                    <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643" facs="0671"/>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s recent talks with
                        several foreign diplomats have been disinterested and essentially pro forma
                        in nature.</p>
                    <p>5. Soviets are increasingly disillusioned with anti-Communist activities of
                        new nations (from Morocco through Arab states to India) to which they looked
                        with such assurance for “peaceful” promotion of their goals and in which
                        they have made, for them, heavy investments.</p>
                    <p>6. They are increasingly conscious of tendency many Asian-African and Latin
                        American Commie Parties to swing toward ChiCom theses.</p>
                    <p>7. Even in Eastern Europe they are plagued by persistent economic
                        shortcomings among smaller members of bloc and Soviet inability force pace
                        of economic integration within <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>III. Current tightening up on domestic scene both economically and
                        ideologically certainly not unrelated to stand-still in East-West relations
                        and to conflict with ChiComs but we believe purely internal factors also
                        play substantial role here.</p>
                    <p>Acutely conscious of Soviet weakness dramatically exposed in Cuban crisis,
                        Soviets have been unable to face up to radical redistribution of resources
                        which would be essential to remove continuing sluggishness from Soviet
                        economy, and especially to solve agricultural problem. Internationally,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has thus lost basic
                        tenet of his “peaceful coexistence” theme, i.e., Soviet ability to
                        demonstrate to world superiority by example in economic competition with
                        West. But equally important, Soviet people are not unaware of Khrushchev's
                        failure to live up to his repeated promises to improve their lot and his
                        recent public admission regime cannot provide both guns and butter must have
                        been a bitter pill for him to swallow.</p>
                    <p>Peaceful coexistence with the capitalist world in the ideological field was
                        ruled out by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> as early as
                        his Novosibirsk speech of October 10, 1959<note n="3" xml:id="d304fn3">For
                            text of this speech, see <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>, October 14,
                            1959.</note> after visits to USA and China. Current clamp-down in
                        cultural field is thus not a new policy but only first purposeful effort to
                        implement <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s formulation
                        that coexistence only applies outside Soviet borders and is continuation of
                        struggle for Communist world by means short of major war. However,
                        ideological clamp-down has developed one issue of potentially critical
                        internal importance in society like this. Sooner or later, someone was bound
                        to raise question inside the Soviet Union which has so frequently been asked
                        outside: Why Stalin's associates did not reveal and take action to stop his
                        criminal terror during his lifetime. It happens that Ehrenburg<note n="4" xml:id="d304fn4">Ilya Ehrenburg, a prominent Soviet writer and protege
                            of Stalin, who was severely criticized in the Soviet press at the end of
                            1962 and early 1963.</note> was the one to raise this question in print,
                        so the furor focused on him—for this reason and not <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0672"/>primarily because of what he has written
                        otherwise or even because he is a Jew. In reply, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> chose in his speech of March 85 to state flatly
                        that: “<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Stalin</persName>'s abuse of power and
                        the facts of his arbitrary rule became known to us only after his death and
                        the exposure of Beria.”<note n="5" xml:id="d304fn5">For text of this speech,
                            see <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi>,
                            March 10, 1963.</note> The baselessness of this assertion could be
                        demonstrated by recourse to the files of any Western Embassy in Moscow
                        covering the Stalin years or even to the world press. However, it must be
                        appreciated that this is the kind of issue which may determine some day who
                        survives or who falls in this country.</p>
                    <p>IV. As for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> personally, he
                        has continued to drive himself unmercifully, participating in official
                        ceremonies and receiving visitors to an extent Western heads of government
                        would consider a waste of time. However, in recent weeks he has clearly been
                        a tired man. In delivering his recent election speech and in making the
                        rounds of receptions with the Finnish Prime Minister he displayed little of
                        his normal vivacity and read his speeches in a listless, monotonous voice.
                        At public gatherings, instead of following proceedings with his usual lively
                        attention or engaging in animated, frequently bantering conversations, he
                        has appeared dispirited and had the air of a man overwhelmed by his burdens.
                        However, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has demonstrated
                        his resiliency before, is taking the precaution of getting out of town for a
                        while, and may well bounce back with new vigor. In any event, his current
                        depression seems clearly to result less from any difficulties with his
                        colleagues than from his difficulties with a complicated world which no
                        longer fits his earlier confident analysis.</p>

                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has given the Soviet
                        people a gloomy forecast of their lot and of Soviet prospects abroad for
                        some time to come. His election speech of 27 February<note n="2" xml:id="d305fn2">See <ref target="#d301fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                301</ref>.</note> and subsequent private remarks to Western
                        diplomats suggest that a post-Cuban policy reassessment has been completed
                        and a general line of action decided.</p>
                    <p>2. The new Soviet course rests on the leadership's “difficult” decisions
                        concerning the serious problem of allocating economic resources. As in 1961
                        and 1962, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has been forced
                        once again to defer any attempt to redistribute resources away from the
                        heavy industries supporting the defense effort to the consumer goods
                        program. He has justified this on the ground of an ominous international
                        situation and the increasing importance of keeping up in the arms race, lest
                        the “balance of power” shift decisively against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. In his speech the Soviet premier acknowledged that the
                        “national economy” is growing more slowly because “reality” dictates a
                        concern for defense requirements involving “enormous sums” and “enormous
                        resources.” In an unusually frank statement <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that maintaining this defense program
                        “diminishes, and cannot but diminish” the prospects for the consumer.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is still committed to a
                        “balance” between the competing sectors, but for the present the proponents
                        of defense clearly have won the struggle with the advocates of more
                        investment for agriculture and other consumer-oriented sectors. How long
                        this solution will prevail is not clear, but <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> implied a long-term effort was required to
                        improve the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s military position. The
                        arms race will “obviously continue” for a long period; old armaments will
                        have to be renewed “all the time.” The Soviets cannot afford to
                        underestimate military requirements, as Stalin did in 1941, but must be
                        prepared for the decisive “initial period” of the war, to strike a
                        retaliatory blow “on the very first day.”</p>
                    <p>4. The general direction of Soviet economic and military policy seems to have
                        been defined, but the precise implications are not clear. The Soviet economy
                        is capable of bearing the defense burden envisaged by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, but at the cost of again
                        postponing any substantial rise in living standards and perhaps risking
                        further decline in the future rate of <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646" facs="0674"/>industrial growth. When last year's mediocre agricultural
                        results are considered along with the reaffirmation of defense priority, it
                        is probable that there will not be a significant improvement in living
                        standards in 1963. Beyond the question of consumption, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s remarks raise the possibility
                        that military programs have been adopted which will affect investment for
                        general industrial expansion and thereby slow general economic growth.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s statements have an air
                        of finality, but he probably came to these decisions reluctantly; the
                        problem of resource allocation will continue to plague the leadership and it
                        is probable that sooner or later this question will be reopened. Indeed, on
                        3 March a top planning official published an article repeating <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s earlier argument for a shift
                        of resources away from heavy industry toward consumer-oriented sectors. If
                        consumers react to future disappointments with manifestations of discontent
                        on the scale of 1962, this line may acquire greater force. However, the
                        proponents of defense, having prevailed again in the policy debates, are in
                        a strong position to win future arguments and even put forward new
                        demands.</p>
                    <p>6. The overall impression given by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is that the developments of the past three years
                        have finally brought him to abandon for the indefinite future his 1960 hopes
                        for easing the military burden on the economy through streamlining the
                        military establishment. While we still think <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may one day reopen the question of force
                        reductions, he clearly does not think it feasible to push any drastic
                        measures of this sort at this time. This speech and his private remarks are
                        clues that the Soviets have found no inexpensive weapons system or low-cost
                        strategy to satisfy their military requirements.</p>
                    <p>7. That <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has opted for such
                        a program should have some important implications for Soviet foreign policy.
                        First, it reflects a further decline in confidence and expectations, already
                        increasingly apparent in the last two years and, in our view, an important
                        part of the motivation for the Cuban venture. Second, there is the
                        recognition that a “pause” is required in international affairs, while the
                        Soviets attempt to repair their position. Third, there is the appreciation
                        that real military strength is still the vital ingredient in the balance of
                        power. Fourth, the internal stress on sacrifice tends to militate against
                        any resumption of détente, any imputation of good intentions to the
                        West.</p>
                    <p>8. The Cuban crisis has, then, been a turning point. In effect, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> seems to have decided that the
                        “world relation of forces” no longer supports the broad political offensive
                        he initiated in 1957. His fundamental calculations about “contradictions” in
                        the Western alliance, the growth of Soviet economic and military power, the
                        cohesiveness of the socialist camp, and the outcome of the revolution in the
                        underdeveloped world have proved erroneous in some degree. Confronted with
                            <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647" facs="0675"/>these failures, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could have chosen to attempt
                        some accommodation with the West, seeking settlements of some contentious
                        issues. This would gain time to concentrate on Bloc and internal problems
                        and to build up Soviet arms, and would probably contribute to the strains in
                        the Western alliance as the Soviet threat seemed to recede. But <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> seems to have ruled out this
                        approach, at least for now. Instead, he has justified his economic and
                        military policy on the basis of a threatening international situation, which
                        suggests that he intends to invoke the “foreign devil.” Thus the present
                        phase is likely to be one in which the atmospherics of propaganda will not
                        be congenial to East-West negotiations.</p>
                    <p>9. This does not mean, however, that hostile atmospherics will be accompanied
                        by aggressive actions. There is nothing in the lessons of Cuba which
                        warrants an optimistic Soviet view of the risks in forward action. On the
                        contrary, the one point which comes through clearly in Soviet pronouncements
                        is a painful appreciation of US power and determination. Whereas <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> earlier seemed to accept new
                        chances for direct encounters with the US, first in the Congo, then in Laos,
                        Berlin and Cuba, he now appears sobered by the thought that the US was on
                        the verge of attacking Soviet forces in Cuba, and appalled at the options of
                        having to counterattack or accept humiliation. The chances of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> making a second such dangerous
                        misjudgment have been considerably reduced, even though the pressures which
                        must have contributed to this initial miscalculation remain operative.</p>
                    <p>

                    </p>
                    <p>10. It is only logical that the end of this offensive phase should be
                        symbolized by the shelving of the Berlin issue as a more or less continuous
                        crisis. This is substantially what <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did in his speech of 16 January.<note n="3" xml:id="d305fn3">For text of this speech, see <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi>, January 17,
                            1963.</note> His subsequent remarks reflect little optimism about the
                        possibility of a negotiated settlement advantageous enough to justify a
                        demonstrative end to the Berlin crisis. Rather it appears that Berlin will
                        remain as an issue for agitation and propaganda, if only to sustain the
                        general contention that the international situation remains tense. Moreover,
                        without a settlement the Soviets retain the opportunity to make some minor
                        encroachments on the Western position, to make occasional new moves to
                        aggravate current Western differences, or to seek better terms for a
                        settlement if governments change in Bonn or London. Finally, if the current
                        respite is conceived of as a temporary retreat, then Berlin will still be a
                        crucial issue to test Western resolve and prove Soviet power in new
                        circumstances.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>11. Talks on disarmament and nuclear testing will probably continue for a
                        time, but there is not likely to be a great Soviet interest in serious
                        dealing on disarmament. It is even possible that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will eventually disrupt the Geneva
                        negotiations, as they did in 1960, when they feel the need for a further
                        demonstration of the ominous state of world affairs. The Soviets are averse
                        to negotiating when they regard their position as inferior, or when they
                        cannot bring outside pressures to bear. The next phase of Soviet disarmament
                        policy, therefore, is likely to be confined to agitation of those partial
                        measures which would inhibit Western defense and disrupt <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> planning for the sharing of nuclear
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>12. As to the test ban, the Soviet position has apparently hardened since
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s 19 December letter
                        to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d305fn4">See <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>,
                            1961-1963, pp. 234-237.</note> Moscow professes to have understood that
                        the US was prepared to settle for 2-3 inspections. But more important than
                        the actual number of inspections were certain implications that a test-ban
                        agreement would have at this time. The present unyielding Soviet stand is
                        based on the judgment that, with the Chinese charging a sell-out and the
                        Soviet populace being called upon for sacrifices, this is no time to
                        encourage hopes for an East-West détente. In addition, the Soviets probably
                        realize that the time has passed when a three-power test ban would pose a
                        real obstacle to the spread of nuclear weapons. Finally, the Soviets may now
                        see the need to maintain a free hand to test again.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The Underdeveloped Areas</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>13. If the Soviets now expect to make no major breakthrough in Europe, then
                        it will become more important to compensate elsewhere in the world, or at
                        least to make sure that further losses are quickly and effectively
                        contained. The underdeveloped areas will continue to be a crucial arena in
                        the contest with the West, but it is becoming more and more apparent to the
                        Soviets that prospects for further significant gains in any near term are
                        very mixed indeed. The Soviets are finding that it requires full-time effort
                        just to keep the influence they have, let alone develop new opportunities.
                        The Sino-Indian dispute demonstrates that a nonaligned country, when it is
                        subjected to pressures by a communist country, can quickly develop strong
                        pro-Western attitudes; the events in Iraq suggest that even the most
                        extensive Soviet influence is subject to rapid deterioration, while in
                        Guinea a process of erosion of Bloc positions is already well along. All
                        this is at a time when the need to mobilize various international
                        combinations against the West is greater than ever.</p>
                    <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0677"/>
                    <p>14. The experience of the last six or seven years has taught the Soviets that
                        most nationalist leaders are reluctant to bring local communists into their
                        governments and are frequently ready to turn on them with repressions. The
                        Soviets lack promising alternatives, however, since in very few cases are
                        the local parties strong enough to attempt a seizure of power on their own.
                        The USSR's recent shrill responses to Iraqi developments and recent
                        denunciations of anti-communist moves in Algeria and Tunisia suggest current
                        frustration on this score. Thus in some cases the Soviets may concentrate
                        upon building local communist strength, even if this risks some injury to
                        their relations with the nonaligned governments. Strong factors in this
                        approach may be the threat of Chinese Communist proselytizing among the
                        parties of underdeveloped areas, and Cuban ambitions to lead the revolution
                        in Latin America.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">The Bloc</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>15. The internal policies enunciated by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, and their implications for foreign policy, ought
                        to be cause for some satisfaction in Peiping. The Chinese would welcome
                        Soviet adoption of a harsher tone toward the West and a turning away from
                        serious negotiations. Nevertheless, we doubt that anything better than a
                        superficial and temporary truce could result from the present exchange of
                        proposals for a bilateral meeting. The Chinese editorials of 27 February and
                        4 March, which followed receipt of the Soviet letter, make it clear that
                        Peiping is determined to break the Soviet hold on the international
                        communist movement; the more the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        adopts policies which resemble those urged by China, the more China is
                        likely to press further demands (e.g., acceptance of Albania, rejection of
                        Yugoslavia) and assert its own leadership of the world revolution. Thus,
                        even though the Soviets will in the coming period see an advantage in
                        quieting down public contention and may proceed toward a meeting, Chinese
                        terms are so high, and Chinese polemics so fundamental and bitter, that at
                        some point the Soviets must resume the offensive.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Some Factors of Uncertainty</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>16. Even if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has settled on
                        a policy line for the present phase, it could be completely upset by several
                        factors. First, there is the Cuban problem: as long as the Soviets maintain
                        their military presence in some size in Cuba, they are vulnerable to
                        American pressures, which for Castro's sake and the sake of their own
                        failing prestige they are obliged to resist. If the Cuban crisis should
                        flare up again, it would overshadow all other East-West issues and have
                        important effects on other aspects of Soviet policy.</p>
                    <p>17. Second, the decision that the consumer programs must continue to give way
                        to military needs stores up problems inside the Soviet Union which will
                        probably require new and perhaps even more painful reappraisal <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0678"/>in the future. There is a wide range of
                        internal issues—de-Stalinization, handling of intellectuals, resource
                        allocation, party- military relations, and the party-state economic
                        reorganization—which may add up to considerable turmoil within the top
                        leadership. These divisions probably have not been fully resolved by recent
                        decisions and the chances are good that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will continue to be under conflicting pressures,
                        and that Soviet policy may correspondingly fluctuate.</p>
                    <p>18. A third source of further policy shifts is developments in the Western
                        alliance. An aggravation of divisions in Europe and between Europe and the
                        US will encourage the Soviets to revive their hopes and pursue more actively
                        the exacerbation of differences in the enemy camp. At a minimum, the present
                        degree of disarray probably already constitutes an argument in Moscow
                        against any substantial “pause” in Soviet policy.</p>
                    <p>19. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s present course
                        appears to be a long, hard pull, bound to increase a sense of desperation
                        and frustration. There remains a possibility that these pressures will force
                        the Soviet leaders to reconsider the advantages of some accommodation with
                        the West. But the danger also remains that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will again be driven to break out of this
                        entanglement by some audacious move abroad, even though this might appear
                        risky or foolish.</p>

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> paper entitled “Soviet Policies: The
                        Next Phase,” states, in summary form, some of the problems and appraisals
                        which an interagency <pb n="651" xml:id="pg_651" facs="0679"/>group, under
                        the leadership of <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>, has been working on
                        for some time, in a more extended treatment. The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> paper is a useful one, and I have only a few comments, as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>While there are many signs that the Soviets have decided to maintain, and
                        possibly increase, the heavy allocation of resources to the military sector,
                        I believe we should keep a sharp eye out to see whether this does in fact
                        prove to be the case. The Soviets are quite capable of deliberate deception
                        on this point.</p>
                    <p>Paragraph 10, which deals with Berlin, appears to ignore the fact that the
                        Soviets have reopened this question, and it is too early to conclude that
                        this is merely an effort to keep the question alive.</p>
                    <p>The statement in paragraph 11 that “There is not likely to be a great Soviet
                        interest in serious dealing on disarmament” may be true in the sense that
                        the Soviets do not consider the time propitious, or the West sufficiently
                        interested to make meaningful agreement possible, but everything in the
                        Soviet situation points to the fact that they should have a genuine interest
                        in real disarmament, and I believe that this is the case.</p>
                    <p>In paragraph 7, it is stated “There is the recognition that a pause is
                        required in international affairs, while the Soviets attempt to repair their
                        position.” While Soviet foreign policy does seem to be on dead center, I
                        suspect this pause is due more to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s internal situation, and the influence of
                        foreign developments on that internal situation, than to the foreign
                        developments themselves, or to the military situation.</p>
                    <p>In general, I am inclined to question the implication of the paper that the
                        Soviets are going to stand still in foreign affairs while they build up
                        their military strength. Apart from the fact that by hardening bases and
                        building more atomic submarines the Soviets can increase their second strike
                        capability, I doubt very much that they anticipate changing the correlation
                        of military forces to their advantage to a degree which would enable them to
                        undertake adventures in the foreign affairs field which they cannot do now.
                        On the other side of the coin, I think that whenever <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s internal situation is improved
                        we can expect further Soviet moves, and possibly radical ones, in the field
                        of foreign affairs.</p>

                    <p rend="center">LARGE-DIAMETER PIPE</p>
                    <p>While the wisdom of our original decision attempting to prevent the export of
                        large-diameter pipe to the Soviet Union is debatable, the manner in which
                        the problem has developed makes it clear that failure to hold the line now
                        would be highly damaging to our interests. The pressure we have put upon the
                        Germans, Italians, and Japanese, would probably not successfully be repeated
                        in another case if the British failed to hold the line on large-diameter
                        pipe. Failure could seriously affect <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        cooperation in general and would be certain to have an adverse effect upon
                        relations between Great Britain and the other countries concerned,
                        particularly Germany. Moreover, I should think there would be serious
                        repercussions in the United States, particularly in Congress. It would seem
                        advisable not only to make a strong effort to persuade the British to hold
                        the line, but also to use this incident as a basis for exploring with the
                        British our widely different concepts of trade relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>So far as the original decision is concerned, we can make a good case on
                        military grounds for our policy. Transportation is probably the weakest link
                        in the Soviet military setup and the completion of an oil pipeline to
                        Central Europe and the branch line to the Baltic States would greatly
                        simplify Soviet supply problems, release rolling stock, and increase the
                        capacity of their railroads to handle other traffic. Oil exports constitute
                        one of the Soviet Union's biggest earners of hard foreign exchange and is
                        used by them to pay for imports, many of which contribute to their military
                        potential.</p>
                    <p>Because of the failure of Soviet agriculture, the leveling off of growth
                        rates, manpower shortages, increased cost of military hardware and space
                        programs, the Soviet Union now has an acute problem in determining the
                        allocation of resources. While they can undoubtedly manufacture the
                        necessary large-diameter pipe themselves, failure to acquire large
                        quantities from abroad will undoubtedly slow down the completion of the
                        pipelines. Moreover, in a highly centralized planned economy like that of
                        the Soviet Union, with its traditional overcommitment of resources, the
                        shift to pipe construction will require extensive changes in economic plans
                        and will probably have a considerable, although temporary, adverse effect
                        upon the development of the economy.</p>
                    <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0681"/>
                    <p>The British argue that a fat Russian is a good Russian, and that it is to our
                        interests to have a continued rise in the Soviet standard of living. While I
                        believe there is something to this argument, there are several factors which
                        should be taken into consideration. One of them is that it does not
                        necessarily follow that increased trade will, in fact, result in increased
                        output of consumers goods, but may in present circumstances merely
                        facilitate further arms expenditures, foreign aid programs, or other
                        objectives adverse to our interests. Furthermore, even if one accepts the
                        British concept, the question of timing is of great importance. Since the
                        death of Stalin, the Soviet Union has been evolving in a direction favorable
                        to our interests. It is important that this process develop far beyond the
                        point it has reached before the Soviet Union is strong enough to devote
                        large sums to foreign aid or other programs to further the spread of
                        communism. We must also keep in mind that should <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> disappear, or be persuaded to change his current
                        policies, it is quite possible that the Soviet Union could suddenly change
                        over to the policies advocated by Communist China.</p>
                    <p>One argument used by the British that is largely phony is that trade offers
                        an opportunity for contacts and for the development of friendship and
                        understanding. Since the Soviets, however, in general, prevent contacts
                        between their end-users and foreign exporters, and handle trade matters in a
                        few central government offices, this is not, in fact, the case.</p>
                    <p>Another argument is that our policies have caused the Soviets to develop
                        production capacity in areas which they would not otherwise do. This is, of
                        course, true to some extent, but this has, of course, been accomplished only
                        at the expense of slowing down development in other areas.</p>
                    <p>It is not suggested that we should follow a deliberate policy of preventing
                        all trade with the Soviet Union, but in cases such as large- diameter pipe,
                        where there is a strong strategic element involved, I believe our decision
                        was sound.</p>
                    <p>Another fine point to keep in mind is that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>, in discussing this matter in
                        Moscow, pointed out that there was a relationship between this problem and
                        the general state of US/Soviet relations, particularly on such matters as
                        the Berlin problem. It would be particularly unfortunate if we failed to
                        hold the line at a time when the Soviets seem to be veering toward a tougher
                        policy.</p>

                    <p>The paper under consideration at the day's meeting was described as an
                        interim product of an <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> project looking
                        toward a post-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> Russia and
                        the before and after policy implications for the US. The need for an interim
                        review flowed from a series of developments which Embassy Moscow, <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                        have been reporting that suggest a quiet but deep crisis is underway in the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and that a sticky and difficult
                        agenda is immediately before the Soviet leadership. The high and growing
                        costs of various Soviet cold war undertakings and commitments, together with
                        prolonged failure to secure worthwhile pay-offs from these, and frictions
                        and conflicts within communist ranks pose serious <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0683"/>dilemmas for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. He needs badly to score a quick success. If not
                        this, then the leadership will have to make a difficult choice between
                        moderating its policies or girding its loins for a long hard pull, the
                        length and end of which cannot be foreseen.</p>
                    <p>We can assume that some very basic staff work is being done on an urgency
                        basis in the Kremlin. It consequently behooves us to be unusually alert
                        regarding both dangers and opportunities. The paper emphasizes the
                        importance of our continuing to block communist expansion whether by
                        military or other means in Europe or elsewhere, as well as to counter
                        effectively Soviet efforts to gain significant advantages in the
                        underdeveloped countries. The paper also underscores an earlier concern that
                        the Soviets may be seeking a “quick fix” through an armaments development
                        that would give them, if not a hard military advantage, at least a great
                        psychological boost a la Sputnik. It is of paramount importance that we
                        safeguard fully against this.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s great need is not a
                        simple increase in military strength. He has it in his power to get this,
                        despite the costs. But military strength in itself is not the objective. The
                        objective is the attainment of concrete political results. But this raises
                        the question of risk. If <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        wants to move, he must be willing to incur greater risks. The basic issue
                        that faces him is the degree of risk the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should run on behalf of communist objectives. If the
                        Kremlin should really “go rough,” we could only conclude a decision had been
                        reached to step up the risk rate. In that case, we had better be set to
                        batten down the hatches.</p>
                    <p>Conversely, we should recognize the possibility of a move in an entirely
                        different direction. The decision might be to reduce the risks and costs
                        that are bearing down so heavily. For this reason, the paper urges that we
                        keep open lines of communications and take other steps that would lead the

                    </p>
                    <p>The ensuing discussion centered around the following major points:</p>
                    <p>1. The importance of periodically reviewing our basic assumptions regarding
                        the Soviet leadership. The timeliness of the <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> paper was generally recognized. We cannot afford, it was
                        said, to lock ourselves into fixed positions as to either the milieu in
                        which the leadership operates or the range of policy choices to which it may
                        be led or forced to resort. We must <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656" facs="0684"/>recognize that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is also subject
                        to change, possibly quite rapid and far-reaching change. No more important
                        matter can be before us than that of discerning and properly appraising the
                        possibility of shifts in the purposes and direction of the leadership. We
                        have been taken by surprise in the past, and often at great costs. We also
                        have doubtless missed some opportunities.</p>
                    <p>2. The seriousness of the resources pinch. Question was raised as to whether
                        the <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> paper did not exaggerate the
                        significance of the decline in the Soviet economic growth rate. Assumptions
                        of difficulties incident to this were central to the entire thesis of the
                        paper. It should not be forgotten that despite the drop in the percentage
                        rate, a tremendous absolute increase in production is still being effected
                        each year and will certainly continue throughout the foreseeable future.
                        Illustrative is a recently published report on plan fulfillment in Armenia.
                        In every area of economic activity in that republic, extremely impressive
                        gains have been registered in the past year just as they have been in the
                        preceding several years. We need to be cautious when making judgments about
                        the limitations that the slowing down of the growth rate places on the
                        Soviet leaders. Granted economic problems and difficulties exist. These are
                        most serious in agriculture. There have also been exaggerated expectations
                        with regard to automation, something that has led to some important
                        shortfalls in plan fulfillment. But we should not place too great reliance
                        on these adverse factors. The tremendous absolute increases will enable a
                        steady expansion of established programs and the addition of new ones. The
                        way is also open for the regime to shortcut the practices of the US and
                        other western countries in satisfying the demands of the people for a better
                        life for themselves. A case in point is projected development of satellite
                        belts around cities. Here something quite striking—in the eyes of both
                        Russians and foreigners—can be done cheaply.</p>
                    <p>That Soviet economic expansion continues impressive was generally agreed. It
                        was argued, however, that economic expansion is not inconsistent with a
                        mounting resources pinch. The key factor is that decline in the growth rate
                        is paralleled by an increase in the requirements rate. The resources
                        available to the regime are heavily over-committed. Something has to give
                        somewhere. Quite evidently there are real—and growing—problems of resource
                        allocation. While this is not the only problem facing the regime, it does
                        make all other problems more difficult.</p>
                    <p>3. How the Soviet leadership may view the situation. According to <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>'s analysis, it was pointed out, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and his associates have fallen
                        into a “no-win” situation. Can we assume that they see their problems and
                        difficulties as we do? Would it not be a worthwhile exercise to try to draft
                        a defense of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s policies as
                        he himself might draft it for presentation to his colleagues? What could he
                        say to justify his course, and to still concern over the future? Evidently,
                        he would have to <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657" facs="0685"/>acknowledge that
                        much had gone wrong. The turn in Iraq, for example, would need explaining.
                        What bright spots could he point to? Obviously, he is being confronted by a
                        need to explain and justify in consequence of Chinese communist attacks.
                        There may also be criticism at home. Someone in the Department should
                        attempt to put himself in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s shoes and draft a reply to his critics. A solid job
                        here could contribute importantly to our understanding.</p>
                    <p>4. Desirability of the US utilizing communist-generated crises to add to
                        pressures operating on the Soviets. One of the policy recommendations of the
                            <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> paper was that in cases where the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>—or communists responsive to the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>—were attempting in particular
                        areas to gain advantage at US or allied expense through crisis mongering or
                        some other device, the US should deliberately seek to reverse the tactic and
                        use the situation to put in jeopardy a Soviet-communist interest, or at
                        least to increase steadily the costs of the “crisis operation” for the
                        communist side. The paper made specific reference in this connection to (a)
                        shifting the emphasis in future negotiations on West Berlin to the problem
                        of Berlin as a whole and perhaps to the over-all German problem; (b)
                        countering any increased effort of the communists in Laos and South
                        Viet-Nam, with moves that would threaten North Viet-Nam, and (c) increasing
                        the costs and risks to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> of Soviet
                        hegemony over Cuba.</p>
                    <p>Serious question was raised to practicability and desirability of such a
                        tactic on our part. In the case of Berlin, for example, other considerations
                        than the simple one of increasing pressures on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> have to be taken into account. Experience of the last
                        several years has shown little money is to be made from trying to tie Berlin
                        in with an over-all German settlement. In Southeast Asia, we have to face up
                        to what our realistic capabilities are to extend the conflict into the
                        “communist garden.” Unless we are prepared to assume heavy costs to get at
                        North Viet-Nam, we might find it far better to continue to concentrate on
                        containing communist efforts within Laos and South Viet-Nam proper. We need,
                        of course, to study the feasibility of the alternative. But we have to take
                        into account possible reaction and the problems this would present to us.
                        There is also question as to whether an extension of the area of conflict,
                        particularly action aimed at Hanoi, would really be an effective means of
                        getting at the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>5. The problem of safeguarding against a Soviet military breakthrough.
                        Uncertainty was voiced as to whether we are paying sufficient attention to
                        what the Soviets may be able to accomplish in either a strict military sense
                        or psychologically through some sort of weapons advance. This was
                        characterized as perhaps the most important matter raised by the paper. Two
                        possibilities were open: an effective anti-missile missile system, and an
                        impressive space weapon. With regard to the latter, we may have become
                        prisoners of our own thinking. We are fond of saying <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0686"/>bombs in space would not be a good first
                        strike weapon. But they would be superb for a second strike. In any event,
                        their psychological impact could be terrific. This whole business needs
                        thinking through again without the hindrance of fixed preconceptions.</p>
                    <p>A counterview held that military men almost without exception discount the
                        importance of weapons in space. It was nevertheless recognized that close
                        attention should be given this matter. We should look at all possibilities
                        with a completely open mind. It would be well, in particular, if
                        arrangements could be made for a thorough briefing on the subject for those
                        participating in this discussion.</p>
                    <p>6. The problem of the underdeveloped countries. It was felt that we also have
                        special need to increase our alertness with regard to the underdeveloped
                        countries. The Soviets, as the paper noted, had so far not scored any
                        notable successes. But in several instances—Iraq for example—the decision
                        could have well gone in favor of the communists and we would have been
                        unable to do anything about it. The underdeveloped countries still offer the
                        best opportunity for Soviet gains that would enable a breakout from the bind
                        of the moment. We are far from being on safe ground in this area. India
                        remains marginal as does a number of other countries. We cannot afford to
                        rest on the breaks we have so far enjoyed, as these can easily prove
                        transitory. We must stay on the track and increase rather than decrease
                        emphasis and effort. Much more needs to be said on this subject than is in
                        the paper being considered. The Soviets appear to be working with the long
                        term in mind. In Africa, for example, they are evidently concentrating on
                        developing cadres for long range use. Assume that by the end of the decade
                        they should have several African countries locked up, Latin America on the
                        go, plus India, Burma and Pakistan. Would this not serve to offset any
                        immediate problems and clinch Soviet confidence and resolve re the future?
                        If we are to succeed in holding the Soviets in check, no area of operations
                        is more important than the underdeveloped countries.</p>
                    <p>7. The problem of influencing desirable policy choices of the Soviet
                        leadership. To frustrate the Soviet leadership in its various designs was
                        recognized as a necessary objective. However, a word of warning was thought
                        needed. Frustration can be a dangerous thing to play with. Under certain
                        circumstances it might produce results the exact opposite of what we want.
                        If the Soviets continue to find their low risk policies leading nowhere but
                        deeper and deeper into a mire of difficulties, they might decide to shift to
                        high risk policies.</p>
                    <p>For this reason, it was stressed, it is particularly important that we
                        provide an escape hatch that might appeal to the Soviet regime but would
                        still not be inimical to our own interests. We should be sure that our
                        efforts at frustration do not include moves threatening to Soviet national
                        interests. We should continually seek areas of agreement. A test <pb n="659" xml:id="pg_659" facs="0687"/>ban treaty, if it can be worked out, would
                        help. So would a “no bombs in space” agreement. We might also seek more
                        systematically to play upon the strong Soviet desire for respectability.</p>
                    <p>Any agreement between the regime and the US was believed likely to have a
                        strong and favorable impact on the Russian people. The Russian people want
                        above all else to avoid a nuclear war. They have no interest in the spread
                        of communism. They are opposed to expenditures on behalf of underdeveloped
                        countries. Their main concern is an improvement in their own standard of
                        living. They are basically friendly toward the US. Any agreement with the US
                        would be associated in their minds with greater opportunities for a better
                        life for themselves. This means that even an “atmospherics” agreement might
                        yield important dividends in the way of getting the ball rolling in the
                        desired direction. One agreement would generate popular pressures for
                        another, and so on.</p>
                    <p>Question was raised about a possible change in our trade policy toward the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Have we really subjected this
                        policy to the type of review it should have in light of existing
                        circumstances? How important are our restrictive measures against the
                        background of a possible nuclear exchange? How effective are they in view of
                        the nearly $4 billion of trade between our European allies and bloc
                        countries? We need to take a hard new look at this whole question.</p>
                    <p>A point that should especially be taken into account is the impact of our
                        policy on Soviet attitudes. The Soviet leaders have always shown a special
                        sensitivity over our trade restrictions. This goes back to the days of
                        Stalin and extends to our present efforts re wide diameter pipe. We are
                        approaching a deep split with our allies over pipe sales and probably in the
                        end will not be able to keep the Soviets from getting what they want.
                        Meanwhile, we will have given more ammunition to those of the Soviet leaders
                        who would argue the US is “irreconcilably hostile” to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and its interests as a matter of
                        principle.</p>
                    <p>Soviet sensitivity over US trade restrictions was seen as deriving from
                        several factors: a resentment over the slight to Soviet prestige and
                        respectability; Soviet belief in the superior quality of American products;
                        faith that with increased trade US businessmen would influence the
                        government favorably toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Improvement in trade relations was viewed as one of the best possible means
                        of moving the Soviet regime along the revisionist road. Rapprochement in the
                        Soviet mind is in fact more closely identified with trade than anything
                        else. From our own standpoint, economic advantage would flow from expanded
                        trade, although there would also be disadvantages in consequence of the
                        improvement that would follow for the Soviet competitive position. This last
                        might be especially serious in the case of oil and civil aviation where
                        Soviet competition is already strong and where adverse political
                        consequences can easily be produced. Aside <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0688"/>from other factors that should be taken into account in
                        reviewing our restrictive policies, emphasis as placed on the desirability
                        of increasing Soviet economic dependence on the US. This has probably been
                        given too little weight in the past.</p>
                    <p>Follow up action suggested by the discussion:</p>
                    <p>a. Preparation of a closed meeting statement by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> [<persName>Kennedy</persName>?] evaluating the
                        present Soviet situation and outlook.</p>
                    <p>b. A briefing review at an early Planning Meeting of possibilities of the
                        Soviets gaining important military and/or political advantages in weapons

                    <p>In a message to British Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, March 28, 1963, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> discussed prospects for a nuclear
                        test ban: “It seems to me that we have to consider the chances of our
                        successfully engaging the Soviet Union in serious negotiations against the
                        background of what is now evidently going on in Moscow. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> appears to be maneuvering either
                        to realign the policies of Communist China and the Soviet Union or to place
                        the blame on Peiping if Soviet-Chinese relations cannot be repaired. At the
                        same time, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has had to
                        confront the Soviet people with the prospect of no improvement in their
                        material well-being because of continuing heavy expenditures resulting from
                        military requirements. In addition, there seems to be another internal
                        bureaucratic reorganization in process. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> probably has too many problems on his hands right
                        now to give the test ban the attention it deserves.” However, the President
                        continued, “this does not mean that we should drop all conversations with
                        the Soviets on the test ban question.” On non-proliferation,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> was also somewhat pessimistic: “The Soviet
                        attitude towards the multilateral force has stiffened to the point now where
                        the Soviet Union gives evidence of unwillingness to adhere to a
                        non-dissemination declaration of the type which we have been proposing.” For

                    <p>A memorandum on the situation in Laos, prepared by the Central Intelligence
                        Agency on March 29, 1963, commented that “the Soviet Union continues to
                        exercise caution in respect to Laos. Moscow appears content with the Geneva
                        settlement and confident that the weaknesses of the coalition government
                        offer sufficient possibilities for ultimate Communist victory through
                        infiltration and subversion to make unnecessary the risks of intervention by
                        Western powers in the event of a renewal of hostilities. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> does not appear to have utilized fully
                        its limited leverage in Laos [to ensure fulfillment of the Geneva
                        agreements], although it probably would seek to restrain the Pathet Lao from
                        any course that Soviets thought might lead to escalation into broader
                        hostilities.” For text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v24">

                    <p>You have asked whether this would be a good time for us to go ahead with the
                        air agreement with the Soviet Union.<note n="2" xml:id="d312fn2">This was
                            done in a memorandum from the President, March 29, which reads: “Would
                            this be a good time for us to go ahead with the air agreement with the
                            Soviet Union?” (Ibid.)</note> After careful consideration, we do not
                        believe that we should proceed now to sign this agreement.</p>
                    <p>You will recall that at the time the bilateral air agreement was initialed
                        (August 21, 1961) we refused to sign it on the grounds that the
                        international <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0690"/>situation made it
                        undesirable to conclude such an agreement. There have been no developments
                        in the international situation which in our view make it any more desirable
                        to sign this agreement now. In addition, a new factor has entered into the
                        picture since August 1961. During the past year and a half the Soviets have
                        been making a concerted effort to extend their civil air lines to and
                        through the underdeveloped countries of the world. We have resisted this
                        Soviet effort, with some success. Our success has been greatest in hampering
                        Soviet efforts to establish a convenient air link with Cuba. The conclusion
                        of the Civil Air Agreement between the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would seriously impair our ability, which
                        is in any case limited, to persuade underdeveloped countries, especially in
                        Africa and Latin America, to refuse overflight and other air rights being
                        sought by the Soviets. Before we sacrifice this position, we should obtain
                        something from the Soviets in return. In our opinion, there would have to be
                        some development representing a major step in improving our relations with
                        the Soviet Union before the air agreement would be in our interest. The
                        conclusion of a nuclear test ban agreement or the achievement of a modus
                        vivendi over Berlin would represent such a development. It might then be
                        argued that the air agreement would give added impetus to further
                        improvements in our relations with Moscow and lead to further
                        agreements.</p>
                    <p>The main arguments in favor of concluding the Air Agreement with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> now are (1) that it would improve the
                        international atmosphere and might encourage a more forthcoming attitude on
                        the part of the Soviets on more important issues and (2) that it would
                        facilitate the expansion of Soviet tourism in the United States which is
                        restricted among other reasons by a shortage of foreign exchange. The first
                        of these arguments is of doubtful validity. The Soviets give every
                        appearance of being in a period of reassessment and of having yet to decide
                        what their attitude and policies toward the West should be. We do not feel
                        that at this juncture our willingness to sign the air agreement, which is of
                        relatively minor significance, would tip the scales in the minds of the
                        Soviet leadership, beset as it is with such weighty problems as the Chinese
                        Communist challenge. Indeed, we would be in an awkward position if, after we
                        signed the agreement, the Soviets adopted a harder line toward us as some
                        internal evidence suggests may be in the offing.</p>

                    <p>I am becoming increasingly concerned that the Soviets may be tempted to shoot
                        down one of our many flights along the periphery of the Soviet Union. While
                        I have been clearing plans for such flights, I am not in a position to weigh
                        the advantages with the risks involved, but they seem to me to be far more
                        numerous than is justified by the present political situation. I would doubt
                        that the Soviets will use force against any flight which does not actually
                        cross into Soviet territory, pending <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s return to Moscow. I think, thereafter, there
                        are two factors that might cause them to attack a plane which came close but
                        did not actually violate Soviet territory.</p>
                    <p>The first of these factors is what I suspect to be the frustration of the
                        Soviet military over what they probably consider as a series of
                        humiliations. These include the forced withdrawal of missiles from Cuba, the
                        intensive and close surveillance of Soviet shipping, buzzing of Soviet
                        ships, firm actions of Western military forces in Berlin, continual
                        overflights of Soviet installations in Cuba (obviously many of these actions
                        were brought on by Soviet initiatives, but this would not necessarily affect
                        their reaction) etc.</p>
                    <p>The other factor is that Soviet foreign policy appears to be on dead center
                        and should the Soviet Government decide on a harder course, I suspect that
                        at least some of the Soviet military would press for action against these
                        flights.</p>
                    <p>I understand that at some time in the past a survey was made attempting to
                        assess the value of these flights against the risks involved, but I wonder
                        if a new assessment is not in order.</p>

                    <p>In a memorandum to the President, April 3, 1963, Attorney General <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> reported that he had received that
                        afternoon from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> a
                        lengthy “talking paper” that was “ostensibly to me from the Ambassador” but
                        in fact “from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to the
                        President.” The Attorney General indicated that he had returned the paper to
                        Dobrynin because “it was so insulting and rude.” However, he summarized its
                        major points in his memorandum to the President. Regarding the test ban, he
                        stated that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wanted it
                        “clearly understood” that “the Soviet Union will not go above their offer of
                        two or three inspection sites. There was absolutely no need to go above that
                        figure as our [U.S.] scientists had clearly demonstrated.” The United
                        States, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> asserted further,
                        was “trying to obtain a greater number in order to commit espionage. In
                        these efforts we were treating the Soviet Union as inferiors—as if we could
                        dictate to them. The United States had better learn that the Soviet Union
                        was as strong as the United States and did not enjoy being treated as a
                        second class power.” Regarding Cuba, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> stated that “the continued pressure on the Soviet
                        Union for the withdrawal of troops from Cuba was not going to be effective.”
                        He claimed, however, that the Soviets “had already withdrawn twice as many
                        troops as the largest number that had appeared in the newspapers here in the
                        United States.” For text of both <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s memorandum

                        was entirely due to the Secretary's heavy schedule and said the <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0693"/>Secretary thought that in view of the very
                        short time he would have, it would be better to wait until they could have a
                        more thorough discussion. When I started to describe what the Secretary's
                        schedule had been in the last few days, the Ambassador interrupted to say he
                        was well aware of this and completely understood the reason for
                        postponement.</p>
                    <p>I then went on to say that he had occasionally asked for personal advice from
                        me on various questions, and that today I would like to consult him on the
                        same personal basis. I said I had been informed of the conversation he had
                        had a few days ago<note n="2" xml:id="d315fn2">See <ref target="#d308">Document 308</ref>.</note> and that it seemed clear from this and
                        from other indications that misunderstanding between our two countries was
                        increasing and seemed to me to be quite serious. I had been considering
                        recommending to the Secretary and the President that the President send some
                        high-level official in whom he had complete confidence and who was privy to
                        his thinking to see the Chairman for an informal talk with the objective of
                        clearing away as much of this misunderstanding as possible. I said this, of
                        course, did not indicate any lack of confidence in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>, but that this sort of thing could
                        only be done by someone who was in close contact with the President. I did
                        not wish to make such a recommendation if it would not be helpful, and I
                        found it difficult to make up my own mind. I said that I realized that on
                        both sides there were difficult problems just now and that I could
                        understand that the timing might be awkward for both of us.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said, without hesitation,
                        that he thought it would be a very good idea. He pressed very hard to know
                        what specific person I had in mind. I tried to put him off by saying simply
                        that it should be a high-level official who was in a position to know what
                        was in the President's mind on various problems. He continued to press for a
                        name by way of illustration and I finally mentioned the Secretary, the
                        Attorney General, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>. I
                        had previously mentioned the Laos problem and said that it could be that
                        developments would be such that a visit by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>, ostensibly on this problem, would be easiest to
                        explain. I said I thought that if the Secretary should go, there would have
                        to be some problem that could be dealt with successfully. I said that if it
                        were the Attorney General, there would have to be some excuse, and I
                        mentioned the possibility of visiting the Leningrad and Moscow Universities
                        where we had students, and pointed out that the Attorney General had made
                        previous trips abroad particularly in connection with universities and youth
                        problems. I inquired if he knew of any event coming up in the Soviet Union
                        which might be used in this connection. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> inquired about timing, and I said I thought this
                        would depend upon developments, but I should have thought some time within a
                        month. He repeated he thought <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666" facs="0694"/>it
                        would be an excellent idea for someone to go and would think about the
                        matter and let me know if he had any further thoughts.</p>
                    <p>I also told the Ambassador that I understood the President would probably
                        send Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> a personal
                        letter, probably some time next week.<note n="3" xml:id="d315fn3">See <ref target="#d316">Document 316</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I then asked the Ambassador what his guess was as to what particular issues
                        were bothering the Chairman. He mentioned first the Cuban affair and said
                        that he was sure, from his own experience in Moscow, that they would
                        interpret the émigré raids as having been condoned, if not actually run, by
                        the United States Government. He did not mean necessarily the President, but
                        perhaps one of the other agencies. He said he thought this had been
                        interpreted as a deliberate effort to embarrass the Soviet Union. He also
                        said that outside the Government, particularly in the Foreign Office, people
                        in Moscow did not distinguish between statements made by prominent Senators,
                        for example, and responsible members of the Executive Branch.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> referred to the Soviet troop
                        withdrawals and the statements by Senator Keating and others which made it
                        look as though the Soviets were withdrawing under pressure. He said that
                        from having attended meetings in Moscow, he knew that they were particularly
                        sensitive to any thought that they were being pushed around or yielding to
                        pressure, and said that while our Government might react the same way, he
                        thought they were particularly prone to this in Moscow. I said I could
                        assure him that while I could not speak for every individual, I knew that no
                        agency of the Government condoned these raids, much less connived at them,
                        and referred to the vigorous action we were taking to stop them. The
                        Ambassador indicated he understood this.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then referred to the disarmament discussions and particularly
                        the negotiations on a test ban. He said he had actually seen the telegram
                        which Kuznetsov had sent reporting his conversation with Dean, who referred
                        to two to four inspections,<note n="4" xml:id="d315fn4">See <ref target="#d274">Document 274</ref>.</note> but stressed the
                        importance of an acceptance in principle. He said he was sure that the
                        Soviet Government and he himself had been convinced that the Chairman's
                        letter accepting two or three inspections had solved the matter, and that
                        when we had come back with a proposal of eight, the Soviet Government
                        considered it had been led into a trap, and that this had been a deliberate
                        effort to play games with them. I pointed out that Mr. Dean had
                        categorically denied having made the statement attributed to him and, quite
                        apart from this, I could assure him that there had never been any thought of
                        our agreement to any such number. The Ambassador replied he was not
                        discussing this but simply trying to explain the reaction in Moscow. <pb n="667" xml:id="pg_667" facs="0695"/>He added that when he had delivered
                        the Chairman's letter<note n="5" xml:id="d315fn5">See <ref target="#d314">Document 314</ref>.</note> to the Attorney General, the latter
                        remarked that this was fine, and the Ambassador had been convinced himself
                        that the matter was settled.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, the Ambassador referred to the readiness with which the
                        Chairman had agreed to receive Norman Cousins,<note n="6" xml:id="d315fn6">See <ref target="#d295">Document 295</ref>.</note> who had told the
                        Ambassador that he had seen the President, that he had no mandate whatever
                        from him, but would like to talk to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> about testing in order to explain the thinking of
                        the American people, as well as what he understood was in the mind of the
                        President and other officials. I said I hoped he understood that Norman
                        Cousins was not particularly close to the President nor the Secretary and
                        probably not in a position to give any authoritative account of their
                        thinking, although he was a man of good will. The Ambassador said he
                        thoroughly understood this and had explained it to the Chairman. He merely
                        cited it as indicative of the Chairman's interest in trying to understand
                        our thinking and reach agreement on this problem.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador asked me what subject would be covered in the President's
                        letter, and I said I did not know, but imagined it would cover more than one
                        subject as there were a number of serious issues between us.</p>

                    <head>316. Editorial Note</head>
                    <p>In an April 11, 1963, letter to Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> addressed the issue of a test ban. Trying to resolve
                        the continuing disagreement over whether Arthur Dean had told a Soviet
                        representative that the United States could accept as few as two to four
                        on-site inspections per year in the Soviet Union (see <ref target="#d274">Document 274</ref>), he assured <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that no U.S. representative had made any such
                        statement. At the same time, however, he said that he had “respect for your
                        representatives, too, and so believe that there was an honest
                        misunderstanding on this point.” He once again tried to convince <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that the multilateral nuclear
                        force being considered by the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty
                        Organization would not be a violation of the principle of nonproliferation,
                        for “no such force could ever be used without the <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0696"/>consent of the United States. The concept
                        of this force is therefore exactly opposite to that of independent national
                        nuclear forces.” <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> also offered to send a senior
                        personal representative to discuss these and other matters with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. “The object would not be formal
                        negotiations, but a fully frank, informal exchange of views, arranged in
                        such a way as to receive as little attention as possible.” For text, see

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> conveyed their views on
                        the test ban issue to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in a
                        joint letter dated April 15. The letter reviewed problems and progress in
                        the negotiations, concluded that “we have reached an impasse,” and proposed
                        “private tripartite discussions in whatever seemed the most practical way,”
                        for example through “our chief representatives at Geneva” or through “very
                        senior representatives who would be empowered to speak for us and talk in
                        Moscow directly with you.” On April 24 Ambassador Kohler reported to the
                        Department in telegram 2719 that he had presented the
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> letter to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. “<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s reception was almost one of disinterest.” He
                        said it contained “nothing new,” reiterated “that Germany was the key to
                        everything and that the nuclear test ban really had no importance,” and
                        expressed regret “for having made mistake of offering three inspections.”

                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied to
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s April 11 letter on April 29 in a long
                        message that concluded by accepting <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s offer to
                        send a senior personal representative to Moscow for informal discussions.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> answered the
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> letter on May 8, expanding on his initial reaction
                        to <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>. He claimed again that the
                        German peace settlement, not the test ban, was the key to “lessening
                        international tension” and repeated the usual arguments for Soviet
                        opposition to on-site inspections. He characterized the
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> proposal to send high-level representatives to
                        Moscow as a “proposal to continue haggling over inspections, but at a higher
                        level,” but he nevertheless agreed to receive them. For text of both
                        letters, see ibid., volume VI, pages 271-286.</p>

                    <p>There continue to be indications that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has been on the defensive on some controversial
                        issues and that his detractors within the party are growing bolder. The
                        extent, if any, to which his political control has been affected remains
                        unclear, however, and the differences do not yet appear serious enough to
                        impair the normal functioning of the government.</p>
                    <p>The treatment of the Soviet May Day slogan on Yugoslavia seemed to lend
                        substance to the recent spate of rumors about troubles in the Kremlin. When
                        the slogan was first published on 8 April, it made no reference to “building
                        socialism.” On 11 April, however, Yugoslavia was moved into the category of
                        countries “building socialism” and was thus ranked equally with all other
                        Communist bloc countries, including China and Albania. The change was
                        obviously aimed at Peiping and emphasized that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and his followers will not modify their doctrinal
                        position that Yugoslavia is “socialist”—a fundamental point of contention in
                        the Sino-Soviet polemic.</p>
                    <p>The original omission suggests a difference of opinion on this question which
                        resulted in the use of the same formula concerning Yugoslavia which has been
                        employed since 1958. Alternatively, the original slogan may have been
                        published at the instigation of some leaders who saw in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s absence on vacation an
                        opportunity to indicate their disagreement with some of his views.</p>
                    <p>Recent signs that former Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> may soon be rehabilitated also suggest political
                        maneuvering. Discussions of his past role began to vary in February, and
                        several military articles have since mentioned his wartime contributions in
                        a favorable context. Most authors, however, have reiterated charges that
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> committed military
                        blunders and followed an “anti-party” line during his tenure as defense
                        minister. That some alteration in <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName>'s official status may be impending was further
                        suggested when a Soviet military protocol officer recently appeared to be
                        angling for an invitation to <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName>
                        to the US Armed Forces' Day celebration on 21 May. <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> has not been invited in recent
                        years, but the omission of his name has never previously evoked Soviet
                        comment.</p>
                    <p>Any degree of restoration of respectability for <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName> would have a political motivation. His removal as
                        defense minister and as a member of <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0698"/>the party presidium in 1957 was clearly engineered by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, who charged that he had sought
                        to gain the independence of the military from party control. Thus, <persName corresp="#p_ZGYA1">Zhukov</persName>'s public re-emergence would be
                        viewed as an indication of increased influence for the professional soldier
                        as opposed to the party, political military leaders, and his return to even
                        partial favor would reflect adversely on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Other recent straws in the wind which suggest jockeying for position by
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s subordinates include
                        an implied criticism in the press of presidium member Aleksey Kirilenko—long
                        a <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> associate—for his
                        performance as Sverdlovsk Oblast party boss during 1955-1962, and a slight
                        momentary downgrading of his name in the usually alphabetical press listing
                        of the presidium.</p>
                    <p>Despite these various signs of stress, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has continued to receive prominent attention in
                        the press. Throughout the time he has been away from Moscow, he has been
                        sent numerous adulatory greetings from various meetings throughout the
                        country, and his statements have been liberally quoted. There have also been
                        references to the party presidium “headed by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.” Although no such position as “head” of the
                        presidium formally exists, the formulation is not unusual and its use
                        conveys to the party faithful that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is indeed the leader.</p>
                    <p>That there is an opposition to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> seems undeniable nevertheless, and it may be
                        asserting itself sufficiently to make the situation intolerable from his
                        standpoint. His past behavior would indicate that he will not stand idly by
                        while his opponents gather strength. He will probably return to Moscow
                        within the next few days, and may at that time attempt a decisive display of
                        his authority perhaps in the form of a new policy statement, further
                        top-level personnel changes, or both. It is possible, however, that the
                        balance of forces within the leadership is now so fine that he will find it
                        politically inexpedient to force a showdown at this time and may therefore
                        have no other choice than to temporize.</p>

                    <p>In a meeting with his advisers on April 19, 1963, the President “indicated
                        his belief that Soviet activities in Cuba should be considered as an element
                        of the problem in Laos,” according to an undated memorandum prepared by one
                        of the participants, William Colby. “He [<persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>]
                        recognized <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0699"/>that action against the
                        Soviets in Cuba would not affect Laos directly but he did feel that the
                        Soviets were continuing the type of harassment effort in Laos that we had
                        stopped by the Cuban exiles and that the Soviets were not moving out of Cuba
                        as we wished. He believed that there were perhaps direct steps we could take
                        in Cuba, such as resumption of low-level reconnaissance, which would place
                        pressure on the Soviets at a place where they were somewhat weaker as a
                        concomitant action to pressures we might impose in the area of Laos.” For

                        linked Laos and Cuba. According to the summary record of the meeting,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> “commented that with the [U.S.] prisoners
                        out of Cuba, we might be in a position to act against Cuba if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> made no move to halt the
                        deterioration in Laos. He asked what action we could take against Cuba.
                        Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> said we should fly
                        low-level reconnaissance missions which were necessary no matter what
                        happens in Laos.” Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> “pointed out that a U.S. bombing raid on Pathet Lao
                        forces in Laos would be easier for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to accept than U.S. action against Cuba.” For

                    <p>However, Department does not wish note receive any publicity at this time.
                        Soviets would undoubtedly regard such move as defensive retaliation for
                        unfavorable publicity Embassy receiving from Penkovsky trial. Also believe
                        Soviets more likely take note seriously if it not followed by

                        retaliation might conceivably serve to intensify pressure on Soviets to
                        modify their practices, it would inevitably create counter public relations
                        pressures here which would probably lead to net Soviet advantage. Also very
                        doubtful we would be able to establish and maintain close controls and

                            Kennedy</persName>, and myself. He felt that these three visits would
                        create a proper preparation for a visit by the President early in his second
                        term. (At another point in the conversation the Ambassador expressed his own
                        personal conviction that the President was certain of reelection, and at
                        still another point he said that it appeared to him that there was no
                        Republican who was even remotely in a position to challenge the
                        President.)</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador asked me how I thought things stood between our two countries
                        and where progress could be made. I said that I was sure he had heard from
                        others that the most important single opportunity for progress now was in
                        the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Cuba. I said that I knew of the
                        conversation between the Chairman and Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> on this point,<note n="3" xml:id="d322fn3">A
                            memorandum of <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> on
                            April 25 is ibid., vol. XI, pp. 788-791.</note> and that it remained
                        very difficult to see how we could make progress on other issues while this
                        one remained between us. I said that we had not pressed this point hard in
                        public because we thought that it was probably better, if possible, not to
                        appear to apply open international pressure. The Ambassador said that this
                        was entirely correct and gave me quite a long “personal” discourse on the
                        way in which his “proud young country” would react to excited speeches from
                        Senator-this or Congressman-that. I assured him that neither here nor
                        elsewhere was the President interested in scoring public victories. What
                        counted for us was action.</p>
                    <p>On other subjects the Ambassador and I agreed that there did not seem to be
                        much prospect of any early movement between our two countries. I remarked
                        that his Government seemed to be preoccupied with other matters, and he did
                        not dissent. He expressed his regret that there seemed to be no progress on
                        the test ban, and repeated something of the same history which he had
                        earlier discussed with Dr. Wiesner. I told him that we quite understood that
                        there might well have been a misunderstanding between <persName corresp="#p_DAH1">Dean</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName>, but I said also that we were much disappointed by
                        the remarks in the Chairman's most recent message about the shape and
                        character of inspections.<note n="4" xml:id="d322fn4">See ibid., vol. VI,
                            pp. 279-286.</note> I said that we continued to believe that it was
                        important to know something about the character of the inspection before
                        settling definitely on a number; I said that the question whether one wanted
                        three or seven loaves of bread necessarily depended somewhat on the size and
                        shape of the loaf. While <pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0703"/>Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was obviously aware of
                        the Chairman's use of the word “symbolic” to describe the inspections the
                        Soviet Government had in mind, he insisted that if in fact we had agreed on
                        three inspections in December, we would have found that the Soviet
                        Government had fully prepared position papers which would have in fact made
                        the three inspections real and useful. He of course repeated the standard
                        Soviet view that no inspections are needed.</p>
                    <p>In response to a further question as to where I thought progress might now be
                        made, I said that I would make an entirely personal suggestion, which was
                        that the nuclear posture of Communist China must be a matter of real common
                        interest to us. I said that I recognized the sensitivity of this topic, in
                        the light of the relations between the Soviet Union and Communist China,
                        which was called a member of the Socialist camp, but I said that I knew the
                        President believed that this problem was one on which it would be useful to
                        have a quite private and serious exchange of views. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s reply was to say that our new
                        plans for nuclear forces in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> did not
                        make it easier for the Soviet Government to deal with the question of
                        Chinese nuclear ambition. He pressed his arguments against the multilateral
                        force rather more strongly than I would have anticipated, and indicated that
                        while he and more sophisticated observers could understand—without
                        necessarily accepting—our argument that this was a way of preventing a still
                        worse result, Russian opinion as a whole would not be so understanding. I
                        emphasized as strongly as possible the arguments for binding the Germans
                        safely in this fashion, instead of leaving them a prey to dangerous Gaullist
                        fancies or other adventurous notions. (I nevertheless drew the inference
                        from <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s tone that while the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is being organized, and until it
                        becomes a fait accompli, it may be hard to make any nuclear arrangements
                        with the Soviet Government. Once it is in place, like <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> itself, it may be accepted as a fact of
                        life from which to proceed.)</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador and I had a brief exchange about Laos in which the only
                        novelty was that he did seem clearly to understand and to agree when I said
                        that the maintenance of the position of Souvanna Phouma was essential to the
                        agreement between the President and the Chairman. I pointed out that the
                        danger to Souvanna now came from his side of the line, and while he gave
                        certain standard answers about the accusations made by each side against the
                        other, I think he took the point.</p>
                    <p>At a number of points in the conversation, the Ambassador and I talked about
                        the importance of private and reliable communication. He repeated what he
                        had said to Dr. Wiesner about the Chairman's disappointment when reports of
                        his December offer dribbled out in incomplete and inaccurate form very
                        quickly on our side, and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        indicated that while he himself understood how such things could happen in
                        our Government, it was quite another matter to explain them to <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676" facs="0704"/>the Chairman. I agreed that there was a
                        problem here and indicated our own interest in maintaining privacy. I said
                        that, in my judgment, if the Soviet Government were interested in further
                        efforts on the nuclear testing problem it would be very important to arrange
                        for intense discussion in some entirely private and unnoticed way. The
                        Ambassador said that the Soviet Government could accept any means of
                        communication that would serve this purpose, since its own ability to keep
                        secrets was not in question. I accepted this point, remarking simply that
                        this was one of the reasons why we were forced to take a different view of
                        the problem on inspection. I repeated that I knew the President was still
                        deeply interested in a test ban and would be glad to see this matter
                        examined intensively on a very quiet basis, although, as I again repeated,
                        we were disappointed by the Chairman's last letter.</p>

                    <p>During a two hour visit with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on board the Patrick J the following points
                        emerged. They are not recorded in exact sequence but topically, since the
                        conversation ranged back and forth.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Reappraisal in Moscow</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>I started by asking <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> what he
                        thought the principal questions are which would be asked of him when he
                        reaches Moscow. He said that the overriding question was whether it is
                        possible to reach any agreement with the United States on any subject. He
                        said there was a dispute on this point going on among the leadership in
                        Moscow and that they were indeed in the middle of a reappraisal. He said he
                        thought it was of great importance that some point be found on which
                        agreement could be reached. He emphasized the psychology of an agreement on
                        something rather than the importance of the subject of agreement itself. <pb n="677" xml:id="pg_677" facs="0705"/>For example, although he said he
                        was not speaking on instructions and that the matter was one in which
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had no interest, he
                        personally thought that even a Civil Air Transport Agreement would be
                        advantageous. The remainder of our conversation was taken up with further
                        exploration of points on which some agreement might be possible.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>There were only glancing references to Berlin. I did mention the possibility
                        of some United Nations presence in Berlin with Soviet token forces in East
                        Berlin and our present token forces in West Berlin. He listened attentively,
                        did not reject the idea, but it was quite clear that no significance ought
                        to be attached to his failure to reject my comment out of hand. I added that
                        I thought an earlier remark of mine to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> two years ago had proved to be well founded, namely,
                        that more time could serve to reduce tensions in Central Europe and that
                        frictions surrounding the Berlin question could become more manageable. I
                        pointed to the easing of pressures on East Germany after the Wall and to
                        such developments as the improvement of relations between West Germany and
                        Eastern European countries.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> emphasized very strongly the
                        psychological importance of a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw
                        Pact Non-aggression Agreement. He said that it did not mean very much in
                        practice but that it could do no harm and that it would be important for
                        those in the Soviet Union who were supporting the view that some sort of
                        agreement with the West is possible. I told him that the Soviet proposal on
                        this subject presented at Geneva<note n="2" xml:id="d323fn2">See <ref target="#d296">Document 296</ref>.</note> had been discussed in
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and that the general reaction had
                        not been entirely negative. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        said they understood that there might be some problems about the form of
                        such an agreement because of problems of recognition but that this was
                        something which the Soviets were prepared to discuss. When I asked whether,
                        for example, an exchange of letters between the Secretaries General of the
                        two organizations would present any problem of form for them, he said this
                        was entirely discussable and left the impression that this would be no
                        particular obstacle. I told him that there was considerable skepticism about
                        a pact which might seem to be as empty as the Kellogg-Briand Pact<note n="3" xml:id="d323fn3">For text of the Kellogg-Briand Treaty on the

                        felt that if we entered into such an agreement and <pb n="678" xml:id="pg_678" facs="0706"/>this were followed by a severe Berlin
                        crisis that we should all look like fools. He said, and I thought with some
                        significance, that such a pact would make such a crisis far less likely. I
                        repeat that Dobrynin pressed this point of a NATO-Warsaw Pact Non-aggression
                        arrangement as though it were now number one priority for those in the
                        Soviet Union who were trying to show that some agreement with the West is
                        possible and that its psychological importance far outweighed its practical
                            insignificance.<note n="4" xml:id="d323fn4">On May 17 <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had discussed this question

                    </p>
                    <p>At one point <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked me what
                        was the significance of the discussions of differences among <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members. I smiled and said whatever the
                        meaning that it had nothing to do with the attitude of the Alliance toward
                        the Soviet Union and that Moscow would make a great mistake if they should
                        misunderstand this. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> not only
                        admitted that this was so but said that Moscow's appraisal was so much in
                        the same direction that they were frankly puzzled about the underlying
                        meaning of the differences being expressed in the West. I commented briefly
                        to the effect that it had much to do with the future internal organization
                        of Europe and some special views of President DeGaulle as to the relative
                        position of France in Western affairs. I added that I thought that it was of
                        great importance to all of us, including the Soviet Union, that Germany be
                        fully integrated into the main body of Western Europe and that this was a
                        development in the general interest of peace.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he would be
                        closely questioned about how he saw the forthcoming Presidential campaign in
                        the United States and the basis upon which President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> would conduct the campaign on
                        matters affecting the Soviet Union. I told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that I could not, of course, speak for the
                        President on a matter which is still more than a year in the future but that
                        I thought that the President would continue to be himself and follow his own
                        deep convictions. In general, I felt that this meant he would recognize
                        fully the solemn obligations which he and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had toward the preservation of
                        peace, that he would continue to strive to maintain close contacts with the
                        Soviet Government in an effort to resolve outstanding issues, and that he
                        would continue his search for particular points at which agreement might be
                        possible. I said the great exception to this general approach was still
                        Cuba, that Soviet military presence in Cuba was not acceptable to the
                        American Government or the American people and that this was a matter of
                        highest sensitivity which deeply impairs an attempt to develop <pb n="679" xml:id="pg_679" facs="0707"/>normal and improving relations between our
                        two countries. I said it was not in our mind to invade Cuba last year, that
                        if we had wished to do so with American forces we would have done so in the
                        spring of 1961, and that the Soviet military intrusion into Cuba and the
                        missile episode produced a shock to our relations which will take time and
                        much effort to repair. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> noted
                        that I said “it was not” our intention to invade Cuba and asked about the
                        present. I said the President had made it clear to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that we do not now intend or
                        desire to invade Cuba, that this derived from our own interests and
                        attitudes in our long-term relations with our Latin American neighbors and
                        that fear of any such action could not justify the continued presence of
                        Soviet military personnel in Cuba. I said that, indeed, there were only two
                        questions of fundamental difficulty between us and Cuba, the one being a
                        military and political affiliation with Moscow and the other being Cuba's
                        persistent effort to interfere with the affairs of other Latin American
                        countries. The social system of Cuba or the treatment of American property
                        were not questions which themselves could prevent a peaceful relation
                        between Cuba and the rest of the hemisphere.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then said that there had
                        been very substantial withdrawals of Soviet military personnel from Cuba and
                        that those remaining were on training and technical assistance missions. I
                        asked specifically about the four Soviet battalion combat groups and he said
                        that he was not speaking on instructions but that it was his information
                        that these units had “almost entirely” gone home. He said there had been an
                        argument in the Kremlin about whether to furnish us exact information about
                        the Soviet military personnel but that some had “gotten angry” and they had
                        decided not to do so. I told him he might wish to consider whether there is
                        anything further on this point that he could say to us, even privately,
                        although we would not be able to tie our hands about commenting on our
                        estimate of the situation derived from other sources.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Laos</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>We had a brief discussion about Laos in which I referred to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s comment to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> that he, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, had some problems because he
                        had undertaken commitments on behalf of a third party. I told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that we were aware of the
                        possibility that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might
                        have some difficulty in exercising a decisive influence on the Pathet Lao on
                        the ground in Laos. I noted that they might now be experiencing some of the
                        difficulties which we ourselves had had with General Phoumi <note n="5" xml:id="d323fn5">General Phoumi Nosavan, Deputy Prime Minister of
                            Laos.</note> prior to the Geneva Accords. But I said that it was
                        important to maintain the element of good faith with respect to the
                        understandings reached between Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> on Laos; otherwise, we would strengthen the hands of
                        those in <pb n="680" xml:id="pg_680" facs="0708"/>the West who say that any
                        agreement with the Soviet Union is simply impossible. I suggested that if
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is having difficulty
                        in Laos that this might be something we ought to discuss frankly with each
                        other in order to see whether there is anything which we together can do to
                        give full effect to the agreement we had reached with respect to that
                        country. I said I frankly did not understand the attitude of the Polish
                        member of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> because I would suppose
                        that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could at least
                        insure the full cooperation of the Polish representative in supporting fully
                        the Geneva Accords. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        underlined the importance of the agreement between <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                        and said that it was important to the Soviet Union because the Soviet
                        peoples are fully aware of the nature of the agreement, the personal
                        commitment of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> himself
                        and that they expected the agreement to be carried out. He made no specific
                        comment about the Pole.</p>
                    <p>Interspersed with the above were occasional comments by <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> about the difficulties “they” have
                        in Moscow in understanding how things can happen in our society without the
                        specific approval and support of President Kennedy. He referred to such
                        things as speeches by leading Senators, leaks of the most confidential
                        exchanges between the two governments, and the general problem of the
                        constitutional limitations upon an American President. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> mentioned these as a part of his
                        problem in explaining the United States to his own people because he himself
                        and, he added, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> have a
                        better understanding of how our system works. He underlined, however, the
                        importance of preventing leaks and noted, for example, that the famous
                        Saturday Evening Post article contained specific phrases taken from a most
                        confidential communication of the Chairman himself. I told him that the
                        President was most anxious to preserve the confidential character of
                        exchanges between himself and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, and that we have taken the most strenuous
                        measures from time to time to insure against leaks or to discover how an
                        occasional leak in fact came about.</p>

                        attitude toward a Latin American nuclear free zone and seemed quite
                        interested when I told him that we had encouraged the Brazilian initiative
                        last year.<note n="7" xml:id="d323fn7">For text of Brazilian proposal for a

                        reminded him that we would not include U.S. territory such as Puerto Rico
                        and the Virgin Islands. He asked about Guantanamo and I told him that we
                        were prepared to include Guantanamo in any such arrangements and subject
                        Guantanamo to the same inspection procedures that would be used for the rest
                        of Latin America, including Cuba. It is my impression that this is a subject
                        in which the Soviets are interested.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> told me that one of the
                        problems which regularly irritates our relations is the people in Moscow
                        think that United States methods in dealing with particular issues leave the
                        impression that we do not take into sufficient account the Soviet Union's
                        prestige as a great power. I told him that Moscow should recognize that we
                        ourselves know that the Soviet Union is a great power and that the Russian
                        people are a brave people; the heroism at Leningrad, for example, is almost
                        as legendary with us as it is with the Russian people themselves. But I
                        added that it was important for the Soviet Union to bear in mind that the
                        United States, too, is a great power and that the American people are a
                        brave people. This calls for a regular sense of reciprocity in our approach
                        to outstanding issues. He said he felt that the general proposition was
                        understood on both sides but that in details (and he made a general allusion
                        to Cuba) he thought we sometimes overlooked questions of their prestige.</p>

                    <p>1. Soviet developments. Soviets facing whole series serious internal and
                        external problems and painful dilemmas. Internally, they seem to be devoting
                        considerable attention to military posture. Disappearance of “missile gap”
                        seems to have led Soviets to realize their military posture not sufficient
                        to permit them to pursue policies they sought. Insofar as Cuban affair was
                        attempt to redress situation relatively cheaply, there is evidence its
                        failure may have led to even more painful decision, that of increasing
                        resources devoted to military (note <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> February electoral speech stressing guns over
                        butter). Soviets may hope not so much actually overtake US militarily, but
                        for some sort spectacular development creating impression of great strength,
                        along lines Sputnik image in late fifties.</p>
                    <p>Virtually any increase in allocation to military would complicate already
                        difficult resources problem. Agriculture in particular requires attention,
                        and it seems unlikely administrative reorganization will successfully take
                        place of greater funds for tractors, fertilizer, etc.</p>
                    <p>Soviet efforts at accelerating economic integration of Eastern Europe are
                        encountering resistance (notably from Rumania) having nationalistic
                        overtones. This problem is closely connected with both internal resources
                        problem and relations with Chinese.</p>
                    <p>Soviets have suffered number of setbacks in policy towards nonaligned. Once
                        promising relations with Guinea and Nasser have cooled, Soviets have been
                        effectively blocked in Congo, Soviets are now competing with ChiComs as well
                        as West in under-developed areas, and coup in Iraq constituted dramatic
                        reverse. Soviets are apparently attempting to salvage something in Iraq by
                        support of Kurds.</p>
                    <p>Internally, problem with intellectuals also appears to have become serious.
                        Attempt to allow somewhat greater intellectual freedom without either
                        allowing it to get out of hand, or controlling it by old proven Stalinist
                        methods is not simple task. Most significant aspect this struggle <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0711"/>would seem be almost unprecedented
                        resistance offered by some intellectual circles.</p>
                    <p>As to rumors of difficulties within Soviet leadership, and possible challenge
                        to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, we have no hard
                        evidence <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is in fact in
                        trouble. Soviet difficulties must have created disagreements and policy
                        disputes within leadership, and may have affected <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s position to some extent. There
                        is probably some sense of general frustration. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s political skill, however, should enable him to
                        survive. We will be interested in seeing if apparent need to replace Kozlov
                        adds to existing strains.</p>
                    <p>2. Sino-Soviet dispute. Dispute is probably most serious problem facing Bloc.
                        Although both Chinese and Soviets have finally, after considerable parrying,
                        agreed on July 5 date for bilateral meeting between <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> and CPC, unlikely such meeting could result in
                        reconciliation. Both sides persist in defending own positions, attacking
                        those of other side, show no signs of willingness compromise on substance,
                        and are actively attempting line up support among <gloss target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss>'s. (See, for example, Hong Kong's 1926 to Dept, rptd Paris,
                        for recent Liu speech.)<note n="3" xml:id="d324fn3">Dated May 14, it
                            summarized Liu Shao-Chi's speech at Hanoi, May 12. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 <gloss target="#t_CHICOM1">CHICOM</gloss>)</note> Soviets are concerned over considerable
                        progress ChiComs have made in lining up Far East parties, and in attracting
                        groups sympathetic to them within number of <gloss target="#t_WE1">WE</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_LA1">LA</gloss> parties directly
                        challenging Soviet leadership.</p>
                    <p>In general sense, dispute is obviously in interest [of the] West, though we
                        see little we can, or in fact need, do to further it at this stage. At same
                        time, it does not solve our problems—Soviet military strength, for example,
                        is unaffected—and it brings with it some dangers, which already apparent.
                        While Chinese will be able rely less on Sino-Soviet alliance, and may hence
                        be cautious vis-à-vis major Western powers, they may also regard some of
                        their neighbors as opportune targets for the more active strategy they
                        advocate. Laos would seem example. Moreover, Soviet influence over Chinese
                        and their sympathizers has significantly decreased, and Soviets now appear
                        unwilling take actions which might focus attention on this decreased
                        influence. Therefore, while Soviets would probably prefer see continued
                        adherence to Geneva accords in Laos, they are letting present situation
                        develop, in hope risks for them are low. In any event, extent of their
                        influence at present is debatable.</p>
                    <p>East-West relations. We see little prospect in immediate future for progress
                        with Soviets in East-West matters. Soviets are dragging their feet in
                        virtually all negotiations with West (test ban, Berlin, disarmament, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Outer Space matters, etc.). Factors may
                        include Soviet recognition they are now in position of weakness, and desire
                        postpone decisions involving West until their position strengthened. May
                        also include Soviet <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0712"/>concern lest
                        agreements possible with West now would make them more vulnerable to ChiCom
                        criticism and adversely affect Soviet struggle for influence over other
                        Communist parties. We would not describe present Soviet posture as hard
                        line, but rather immobility and absence of soft line. We do not, therefore,
                        expect aggressive Soviet actions which would risk major confrontation with
                        West, though there may well be more aggressive Soviet efforts exploit
                        situations that arise, (such as Kurds) when they consider risk of doing so,
                        in terms of confrontation with West, to be low. Since present Soviet posture
                        seems to be one of holding action, rather than movement towards harder or
                        softer line, we would expect them to try keep channels of communication open
                        to us. We consider it in our interest to keep channels open, both to prevent
                        Soviets from feeling compelled for lack of alternatives to drift into harder
                        line, and to facilitate further progress at such time as Soviets decide this
                        possible.</p>

                    <p>On May 18, 1963, the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Glenn T. Seaborg</persName>, flew to Moscow for the

                        Purposes that would replace the one signed in 1959. The 12-day visit to the
                        Soviet Union, which Seaborg described as “memorable,” included the signing
                        of the Memorandum on May 21, visits to laboratories and scientific
                        institutes, and conversation with Presidium Chairman <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and Education Minister Vyacheslav
                        P. Yelyutin on May 29. Memoranda of these two conversations were transmitted

                    </p>
                    <p>1. The position in which the Soviet leaders find themselves in 1963 is not
                        the one which they anticipated five years ago. Soviet thinking in 1958 was
                        pervaded by a general optimism arising from a number of factors and
                        calculations. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, who had
                        recently obtained a commanding position, apparently judged that he had
                        overcome both economic dislocations and the political turbulence unloosed by
                        de-Stalinization and could look forward to steady and substantial internal
                        progress. His view of relations among Communist States seems to have been
                        that, freed of the burden of Stalinist excesses, Soviet policy could guide
                        the Bloc more effectively with a looser hand while preserving the essentials
                        of Moscow's leadership.</p>
                    <p>2. Looking out upon the non-Communist world, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> probably had considerable hopes that trends in
                        the underdeveloped areas would continue to run in his favor and that the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s earlier successes in the Middle
                        East could be extended in that area and repeated in Asia, Africa, and Latin
                        America. Most important of all, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
                        early sputnik and <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> successes evidently
                        persuaded him that the image and perhaps even the substance of Soviet
                        physical power would soon overbear that of the US and bring the West to the
                        conference table ready for concessions to his demands. In short, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in 1958 saw the “world relation
                        of forces” shifting rapidly in favor of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and believed that history, with vigorous assistance from
                        Moscow, would in the coming period reward the Soviet cause with regular,
                        tangible advances.</p>
                    <p>3. Almost none of this has come to pass. In the relations of military power,
                        regarded by the Soviets as an indispensable element in their general
                        calculation of forces, US military and intelligence programs have led to a
                        situation in which both sides, and indeed much of world opinion, understand
                        that strategic advantage does not lie with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Berlin <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686" facs="0714"/>ultimatum of 1958 remains unfulfilled and, save for the constriction of
                        East Germany's refugee flow, basic Soviet aims in the key area of Germany
                        are no further advanced. Although the Soviets may expect some benefits from
                        present strains in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, over the last five
                        years the strength of the West as a whole has almost certainly assumed a
                        more formidable aspect in their eyes. In the underdeveloped countries,
                        postcolonial nationalism has in most areas openly diverged from the
                        hoped-for association with Soviet policies, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has not succeeded in establishing patronage, much less
                        control, over the new nations.</p>
                    <p>4. Over the same period, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
                        relations with its major ally have fallen into acute disarray, and the
                        Soviets must now defend themselves throughout the Communist movement to
                        preserve a leadership which had not been effectively challenged for four
                        decades. At home, economic progress has faltered for a variety of reasons,
                        of which the most important is the impact of military and space spending. At
                        the same time, intellectual circles have used <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s attacks upon Stalin to raise painful questions
                        which tend to challenge the authority of the party and its present
                        leaders.</p>
                    <p>5. This is by no means to say that the last five years have brought an
                        uninterrupted series of defeats for Soviet policy. During this period, for
                        example, a procession of space feats has regularly revitalized Soviet
                        prestige and sustained the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s lead in
                        this important field of competition. Both nuclear and missile development
                        have recorded notable technical progress. The Berlin Wall has greatly eased
                        the problems of the client state of East Germany. Cuba's accession to the
                        Communist camp remains a major gain despite the October backdown and the
                        subsequent problems and dangers encountered in dealing with Castro and the
                        US. Nevertheless, the Soviet leadership seems to recognize the last five
                        years as a period in which problems accumulated.</p>
                    <p>6. There is no sign that this trend has caused the Soviets to revise their
                        fundamental assumptions or that they regard these setbacks as more than
                        temporary. There are many signs, however, of a recognition that earlier
                        expectations were overoptimistic. Their unwillingness to turn over Berlin
                        access to East Germany and their precipitate withdrawal of strategic
                        missiles from Cuba are the most striking instances testifying to a sober
                        appraisal of their opportunities under the present relation of forces
                        between East and West. A similar concern can be observed in their treatment
                        of the Sino-Soviet dispute, the importance of which they no longer attempt
                        to deny, and of their military position, where assertions of absolute
                        superiority have given way to claims of parity and expressions of anxiety
                        about US intentions and the future relation of military forces. Similarly,
                        the indiscriminate optimism of Soviet pronouncements concerning new
                        countries and independence movements <pb n="687" xml:id="pg_687" facs="0715"/>is now heavily tempered by criticism of the bourgeois and anti-Communist
                        tendencies of nationalist leaders. Domestically, the regime has had to issue
                        warnings to consumers that defense priorities will cut into the program to
                        raise living standards, and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> does not seem confident that former rates of
                        general economic growth can be quickly regained. In sum, the leadership
                        appears to realize that the disappointments of recent years are not isolated
                        but in fact represent a series of related setbacks stemming in part from
                        mistaken appraisals of the possibilities open to Soviet policy.</p>
                    <p>7. In our view, the attempt to deploy strategic missiles in Cuba was in
                        considerable part due to Soviet recognition of this trend. We think that the
                        Soviet leaders, as they pondered this venture, were highly conscious of the
                        failing momentum of their offensive and therefore put a very high premium on
                        a dramatic triumph which they could turn to account in many ways—to alter
                        both the image and the substance of relative power, to prepare a fruitful
                        ground for Berlin negotiations, to undermine US influence in Latin America,
                        to disarm Chinese criticisms. They may have judged the chances of failure as
                        high but nevertheless felt it necessary to take a calculated risk, or the
                        need for a victory may have led them to persuade themselves that the chances
                        of failure were in fact low. In any case, we believe that the accumulated
                        discouragements of recent years contributed to a decision which did not
                        reflect the caution usually characteristic of Soviet foreign policy
                        moves.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">II. The Situation in the Leadership</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>8. The failure of the Cuban missile venture has aggravated all the problems
                        which the Soviets meant it to resolve. There are various signs that it has
                        also affected Soviet top-level politics. Analysis of the workings of the
                        Soviet leadership must always involve considerable speculation, but our
                        tentative conclusions suggest that, at the present time, Soviet foreign
                        policy may be influenced in more than usual degree by internal
                        disagreements.</p>
                    <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> occupies the central
                        position in Soviet politics, and his personality and conceptions give a
                        strong stamp to both the internal and foreign policies of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He is capable of revising ideology to
                        suit his purposes, but he is a great deal more than merely pragmatic.
                        Compared to his predecessor and apparently also to some of his present
                        colleagues, he is an imaginative innovator in both doctrine and policy,
                        prone to change course rapidly in his incessant search for results.
                        Approaching each new tactic with his characteristic energy, he tends to
                        outdo others in boldness and often to assume considerable risk, trusting to
                        his political skill to retrieve a situation somehow if difficulties ensure,
                        even by reversing himself completely if necessary. The prime move of this
                        type which can be directly associated with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is the daring stroke of de-Stalinization, but the
                        same traits can be observed in such disparate <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0716"/>moves as the New Lands campaign, the Berlin challenge of
                        1958, the 1960 military reorganization plan, the cultivation of a “spirit of
                        Camp David,” and the two reconciliations with Tito.
                        This pattern suggests to us that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> either initiated the Cuban missile venture
                        himself or adopted it early and supported it against any doubters.</p>
                    <p>10. Because of these tendencies, any opposition to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> within the Soviet leadership has
                        tended to be a conservative opposition, that is, one which both prefers
                        greater caution in the appraisal of risks and shies away from novel
                        departures in doctrine or policy. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is accessible to the ideas of others, but it
                        appears that most of his innovations originate either with himself, younger
                        associates, or specialists rather than with his colleagues in the top
                        leadership. While he is usually able to muster majorities for his proposals,
                        some of them have at various times encountered opposition which has limited
                        or even undone them. And when several of his programs encounter difficulties
                        simultaneously, the restraints exerted by his colleagues accumulate. If the
                        coalescence of opinion is strong, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> reacts by shifting ground to place himself at the
                        head of the new and more conservative consensus which is forming. But he
                        often returns to his original conceptions when he deems that a propitious
                        moment has arrived.</p>
                    <p>11. The recent period appears to be one in which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has been on the defensive and has had to move
                        away from venturesome positions with which he had clearly identified himself
                        in the past. In February, he all but abandoned his longstanding proposals
                        for a substantial increase in allocations to agriculture and light industry;
                        these had been continually opposed by the military and probably by some
                        political leaders as well. In March, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s chastisement of rebellious writers and artists
                        abruptly checked the de-Stalinization campaign which he had himself revived
                        last fall. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in the past has
                        used de-Stalinization as a means of direct attack upon political opponents,
                        and it is possible that this latest reversal represents a successful defense
                        by his intended targets. At a minimum, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s judgment has probably been discredited by the
                        strong antiregime overtones which emerged when the intellectuals responded
                        to his earlier encouragement to renewed attacks on Stalin.</p>
                    <p>12. These moves are logical responses to real problems, but they also comport
                        better with the predilections of some of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s colleagues than with his own earlier views and
                        this, along with several ambiguous indications of current uncertainty in
                        Moscow, suggests that his predominance has diminished somewhat. The
                        difficulties with China, the frustrations over Berlin, and the humiliation
                        in Cuba have probably worked in the same direction. We think it unlikely
                        that any faction is actively seeking <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s downfall. Instead, such leaders as <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SMA1">Suslov</persName> have probably wished to bring about a greater
                        practice of collectivity <pb n="689" xml:id="pg_689" facs="0717"/>in Soviet
                        policymaking and, by this route, to tighten central controls, insist upon
                        ideological conformity, and eschew radical and risky departures in domestic
                        and foreign affairs. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        temperament is not amenable to collectivity, however, and he is likely to
                        respond to checks of this kind by moving to reassert his dominance.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName>'s illness is in this
                        respect convenient; whether real or political, it undermines his present
                        strength and may lead to further personnel shifts which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could turn to his own
                        advantage.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">III. The Soviet View of Present Opportunities</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>13. We believe that a phase in regime politics of the sort described above
                        has contributed to the relative immobility which seems to characterize
                        current Soviet foreign policy. Even without this factor, however, there are
                        important reasons for the Soviets to avoid major new moves. From the
                        leadership's viewpoint, no major change in Soviet policy, such as a serious
                        attempt to reduce cold-war tensions drastically or a vigorous new offensive
                        against non-Communist positions, seems to offer much promise at present.</p>
                    <p>14. The Soviets would not expect that they could improve their position
                        through negotiated agreements at a time when they are relatively weak and
                        their enemy feels relatively strong. In such periods, the task of Soviet
                        diplomacy is primarily to pursue defensive tactics until a more favorable
                        correlation of forces can be brought about. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s post-October advocacy of negotiation and
                        compromise was intended primarily to buttress his version of the missile
                        withdrawal as a victory for peace rather than a defeat for the Soviet Union
                        and to forestall possible US efforts to follow up with pressures on other
                        Soviet positions. The Soviets did offer one concession which seemed
                        important, probably also to them, when <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> accepted the principle of on-site inspection of a
                        test ban. But the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> soon indicated, by
                        its conduct of the negotiations which followed and its refusal to go beyond
                        three inspections, that it required greater counterconcessions than were
                        forthcoming from the US before it would actually sign a treaty. The
                        requirement to sustain some commitment to Cuba in the face of continued US
                        hostility to Castro raised a further barrier against any general relaxation
                        of tensions, as did the need for an external threat to justify continuing
                        deprivations at home.</p>
                    <p>15. In fact, while statements praising the method of mutual concessions have
                        not dropped out of Soviet propaganda altogether, they are now overshadowed
                        by charges that the West remains hostile and has no genuine interest in
                        reaching settlements. This does not mean, however, that aggressive Soviet
                        actions are to follow. In the first place, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> recognizes that the world situation currently presents no
                        opportunities for major advances at tolerable levels of risk: indeed, in
                        1963 it has suffered distinct reverses in the Middle East and is having
                        difficulty in holding its own in some areas of Africa. In the second place,
                        the Cuban <pb n="690" xml:id="pg_690" facs="0718"/>episode has demonstrated
                        to the Soviets that forward action is not without peril. Current Soviet
                        pronouncements betray a keen appreciation of US power, and the October
                        crisis has almost certainly persuaded them that they had underrated US
                        determination to use that power.</p>
                    <p>16. In these circumstances, the Soviets seem to see the present period as one
                        which can best be used to build up their strength and to fortify existing
                        positions in preparation for future opportunities to make new advances. They
                        seek in the first instance to strengthen their military power in hopes of
                        gaining a position which repairs their prestige and lays greater inhibitions
                        on Western policy.<note n="2" xml:id="d326fn2">The Assistant Chief of Staff,
                            Intelligence, USAF, does not consider the reasons listed sufficiently
                            describe the basis for Soviet military policy decisions. He would insert
                            the following sentence at this point:</note> Recent strong
                        reaffirmations of military priorities reflect a determination to proceed
                        with existing programs and, beyond this, a possible decision to increase
                        military spending above previously planned levels. These programs already
                        include the introduction of protected strategic missile systems, the
                        development of very-high-yield warheads, and a major antiballistic missile
                        effort which has already led to the deployment of a first-generation system
                        at one location. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is also pursuing
                        a vigorous research and development effort aimed at technological advances
                        which could radically enhance both the war-fighting capability and the
                        political value of its military establishment. As an important aspect of
                        these efforts, the Soviets are conducting a space program aimed at
                        prestigious accomplishments and are almost certainly investigating the
                        feasibility of military space systems.</p>
                    <p>This would be in furtherance of a basic Soviet military policy objective of
                        building by such means as become available toward achievement of a military
                        superiority over the West. [Footnote in the source text.]</p>
                    <p>17. We do not mean, however, that the Soviets consider that, unless they can
                        achieve some sort of military advantage over the West, their political
                        advances have reached final limits. Military power remains only one
                        ingredient, albeit a very important one, in the Soviet concept of the forces
                        which determine their prospects. Still less do we believe that Soviet
                        foreign policy in the present phase will be passive. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will be alert to search out
                        vulnerabilities in the non-Communist world, to exploit the differences which
                        have arisen in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance, and to
                        make its influence felt throughout Asia, Latin America, and Africa. But the
                        Soviet leaders' outlook is not one of high confidence that events can
                        readily be made to move in their favor, and we think it likely that they
                        will take a sober view in the present period of the opportunities for major
                        advance.</p>
                    <p>18. There is one important caveat to this judgment. We have identified the
                        need for a major triumph which would reverse a trend of adversity <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0719"/>as an important part of the Soviet
                        motivation for deploying missiles to Cuba. This need still remains; in fact,
                        it has been magnified by the Cuban failure itself and by subsequent
                        problems, such as the Communist setback in Iraq, the Western gain in India,
                        and the renewed Chinese onslaught on Soviet leadership of the Communist
                        movement. While we think it probable that the Cuban venture has strengthened
                        the counsels of caution in Moscow, we cannot exclude the possibility of some
                        new and audacious move. Such actions are essentially incalculable, although
                        we think they are somewhat more likely when <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s ascendancy is high than when collectivity, that
                        is, his need to defer to the opinions of others, has been strengthened. Nor
                        can we predict where such a move might be launched. We note, however, that
                        Berlin would offer a field for a far-reaching Soviet victory, although it is
                        obviously an extremely risky area in which to pose a major challenge.</p>
                    <p>19. It is also conceivable that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will react to present frustrations in the
                        opposite way, that is, by focusing upon a major agreement with the West,
                        rather than a major encroachment against it, as the means of restoring
                        movement to Soviet policy and scoring a personal triumph. Given the present
                        status of such issues as a nuclear test ban and Berlin, it is difficult to
                        see how he could expect to achieve an early settlement without making
                        visible concessions or reductions in earlier Soviet demands. If he
                        nevertheless chose to pursue this course, and to represent the results as
                        important advances for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, he would
                        thereby set up a powerful momentum for general detente and bring new
                        confusion into official ideology. This in turn would intensify the strains
                        in the international Communist movement and magnify present doubts within
                        the Soviet Party about his leadership. For these reasons, and because of
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s own ambitions to
                        achieve the kind of victories abroad which are clear defeats for the West,
                        we think it very unlikely that he will proceed in this direction, although
                        we cannot entirely exclude this possibility.</p>

                        however, that the Soviets expect these talks to lead to <pb n="692" xml:id="pg_692" facs="0720"/>any early agreement on Berlin. Instead, we
                        believe that their motives are, first, to avoid the impression of weakness
                        which would be conveyed by allowing the issue to die entirely and, second,
                        to get into a position to sow distrust and suspicion among the Allies and
                        West Germany. In pursuing these ends, they are likely to resort to sporadic
                        local harassments.</p>
                    <p>21. It is possible, however, that the Soviets will in fact seek some sort of
                        mutually acceptable Berlin agreement as a way of discharging <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s longstanding commitment on
                        this matter and collecting such concessions as can be extracted in return
                        for an easing of pressures on the Allied position in the city. In such an
                        effort, they would presumably have to accept a continued Allied presence in
                        West Berlin and some form of guaranteed access. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for its part would be primarily interested in extracting
                        as much recognition as possible for the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>,
                        perhaps by involving it in the administration of Allied ground and air
                        access in a way which did not entirely extinguish formal Soviet
                        responsibility. Once such an agreement was achieved, the Soviets would
                        probably feel free to fulfill their long-adjourned promise to conclude a
                        peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would of course wish to set a
                        predetermined duration on a Berlin agreement and, if this proved impossible,
                        to obtain a formula sufficiently vague on this point to allow them to renew
                        pressures at some future time.</p>
                    <p>22. Recent developments in the Western Alliance affecting the control of
                        nuclear weapons and the present check to the European unity movement seem to
                        have focused Soviet attention once again on Europe. The prospects for
                        changes of political leadership in West Germany and Britain probably
                        reinforce this tendency. We do not foresee any particular Soviet initiative
                        aimed at European problems, but the possibility of promoting disarray in the
                        Western camp may be more strongly present as a factor affecting Soviet
                        policy than it has been for some time past. Both the Franco-German
                            treaty<note n="4" xml:id="d326fn4">For text of the Franco-German treaty,
                            signed at Paris, January 22, 1963, see <hi rend="italic">American
                                Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1963</hi>, pp. 486-488.</note>
                        and the plans to admit West Germany to a larger role in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s nuclear policy have already provoked a
                        sharp verbal Soviet response. The vague threat to take countermeasures
                        against West German participation in a multilateral force probably has no
                        more substance than the long series of threats which have accompanied the
                        whole process of German rearmament. It is possible, however, that the
                        Soviets will respond by increasing their efforts to extract from the West
                        some formal recognition of the existence of two Germanies, reasoning that
                        this would offset the dangers of a nuclear-armed Federal Republic by making
                        it more difficult for Bonn to mount heavy pressures against East Germany.
                        There may also be a revival of Soviet interest in limited arms control
                        measures affecting Germany.</p>
                    <pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693" facs="0721"/>
                    <p>23. Disarmament. The Soviets probably still see certain advantages to
                        themselves in more general measures of arms control and disarmament. They
                        would doubtless count it an advance, for example, if they could find a means
                        of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons or reducing the chances
                        of accidental war. The burden of modern armaments on the Soviet economy is
                        an increasingly important argument for the stabilization of the arms race.
                        On the other hand, the Soviets set great store by the political usefulness
                        of great military power. Furthermore, they are aware that broad disarmament
                        or arms control measures would have profound implications—intimate
                        cooperation with the enemy and recognition of a higher sovereignty in an
                        international control organ—running contrary to their assertions of
                        inevitable hostility between the two world camps. As a result, they have
                        regarded disarmament questions primarily as an opportunity to capture peace
                        sentiments and to mobilize pressures against Western military measures.</p>
                    <p>24. Present Soviet behavior indicates that post-October reappraisals have not
                        altered this approach, and that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        does not regard the present period as a favorable one for reaching arms
                        control agreements which would advance Soviet interests. Such a conclusion
                        seems to be reflected in the announcement of economic policies which
                        recommit the Soviets to an intense military competition. Moreover, in the
                        present context, it would be difficult to move on to further significant
                        advances in the field of disarmament and arms control without first
                        concluding a test ban agreement. The Soviets have evidently decided that the
                        gap between Soviet and US positions on this matter, while narrowed, is still
                        too wide to be bridged. In this, we believe that they are influenced by the
                        desire not to encourage hopes for a detente which would be generated inside
                        the USSR by a major East-West agreement. During the present phase,
                        therefore, we believe that the Soviets' approach to disarmament will be
                        primarily agitational and will focus on those measures which offer one-sided
                        rather than mutual advantages.</p>

                        Cuba have now emerged. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s immediate
                        objective is to preserve the position it won in 1960-1962, in the face of
                        pressures from the US and problems in dealing with Castro. To this end it is
                        continuing a substantial flow of economic assistance which appears
                        sufficient to maintain the Cuban economy at least at present levels. It
                        regularly reiterates a commitment, albeit undefined, to the security of the
                        regime. While the Soviets of course would prefer a disciplined puppet to
                        take charge in Havana, they have accepted Castro, put up with his periodic
                        public barbs at the <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694" facs="0722"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and apparently agreed that the
                        Moscow-oriented Communists should avoid conflict with him. Similarly, they
                        are trying to reduce the chances of heightened US pressures by not firing
                        upon overflights, by withdrawing some personnel, and probably also by urging
                        Castro to soft-pedal the fomentation of armed revolution in Latin America.
                        One purpose of these actions is to induce the US to move toward de facto
                        acceptance of Castro.</p>
                    <p>26. The pattern of Soviet policy toward Cuba described above probably means
                        that the primary Soviet aim at present is to consolidate communism in Cuba
                        with a view to using it as a foothold from which to pursue the longer term
                        struggle for Latin America which the Soviets foresee. If this is so, it is
                        unlikely that the Soviets would prejudice this aim by again attempting to
                        use Cuba as a strategic base, thus courting violent US action against the
                        Castro regime. This is not to say that the Soviets will never again attempt
                        the introduction of some sort of offensive weapons system into Cuba. The
                        time might come when they would again calculate that the net of advantages
                        and risks would favor such an attempt. For at least the near term, however,
                        the Soviets almost certainly estimate that the risks of such an attempt
                        would be excessive.</p>
                    <p>27. If this is their present judgment, the Soviets must reconsider the
                        usefulness to them of those forces which went to Cuba as part of the missile
                        deployment. There are some signs that they intend to make gradual further
                        withdrawals, but we would expect a significant number of Soviet military
                        personnel to remain in Cuba indefinitely, in training and advisory roles at
                        least. We expect the Soviets to hand over to Castro their advanced weapons
                        as the Cuban forces are trained to operate them, possibly including control
                        over the surface-to-air missile (SAM) system. We are unable to estimate a
                        date by which Cubans would acquire complete control of the SAM system, but
                        we do not exclude that this could occur as early as the latter part of 1963.
                        This would, in the Soviet view, involve some risk of Cuban attacks upon
                        reconnaissance aircraft which could touch off a new major crisis, but they
                        may regard this risk as preferable to the political cost of either
                        withdrawing the system or trying to keep it indefinitely under their own
                        command.</p>

                            Files)]</note> The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s understanding
                        of the “national liberation” movement identifies the emergence of new,
                        independent nations as an important gain for the Soviet world position. The
                        Soviets go on, however, to argue the necessity of a second stage, that of
                        “national democracy,” the hallmark of which is the participation of local
                            <pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695" facs="0723"/>Communists in a governing
                        national front. This in turn creates the prerequisites for “completing” the
                        revolution, with or without violence, by installing the Communist Party in
                        power. Events of the last five years, however, have not followed this
                        pattern. Cuba has reached approximately the predicted destination, but by an
                        unpredicted route and in a manner which leaves the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> with economic and military leverage but without full
                        disciplinary control. The Indonesian Communist Party has successfully
                        practiced the tactics of building political weight and respectability and
                        shows some promise of leading its country into the phase of “national
                        democracy.” But the Cuban experience, and the Indonesian Party's behavior in
                        the Sino-Soviet dispute, cannot give the Soviets much assurance that the
                        Indonesian Party in power would follow Soviet guidance in a disciplinary way
                        either. Elsewhere, nationalist leaders have generally rebuffed or even
                        repressed the Communists; in some cases, Soviet state relations with the new
                        governments have not escaped damage.</p>
                    <p>29. One of the features of the general line of policy described in this paper
                        will probably be an increased emphasis, in areas where this is feasible, on
                        efforts to build subversive capabilities and tangible political assets
                        within the underdeveloped countries. The challenge of the Chinese
                        Communists, and in Latin America the competing appeal of Fidelismo,
                        reinforce the reasons for a greater Soviet effort in this direction.
                        Nevertheless we do not expect any radical turn in Soviet policy stressing
                        early Communist attempts to come to power. The Soviet leaders continue to
                        give evidence that, in most cases, they regard such attempts as premature,
                        more likely to set back rather than advance the fortunes of the local
                        parties, and prejudicial to other Soviet interests. Meanwhile, they will
                        continue to rely upon diplomacy and material assistance; even though
                        stringencies in the domestic economy and their growing awareness of the
                        limited political returns on aid programs may lead them to become more
                        selective in assuming new economic commitments, they do not wish to abandon
                        this field to the West.<note n="7" xml:id="d326fn7">For an examination of

                    <p>30. Communist China. At the present stage of the Sino-Soviet dispute, neither
                        Moscow nor Peiping entertains much hope of pressuring or persuading the
                        rival leadership to alter its stand. The stakes in the conflict are
                        therefore the allegiance of other Communist parties and radical movements in
                        the non-Communist world. Because China has made gradual but regular gains in
                        this competition over the last two years, particularly in Asia, the Soviets
                        have a strong interest in gaining some sort of respite, especially at a time
                        when the accumulation of problems elsewhere <pb n="696" xml:id="pg_696" facs="0724"/>has lowered their prestige. The clearest example of this
                        interaction occurred last October when the Soviets, foreseeing the
                        possibility of a retreat in the Cuban missile crisis, made a vain bid to
                        forestall Chinese criticism by momentarily supporting Peiping in its border
                        dispute with India. The same tendency is evident in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s call for a truce in polemical
                        warfare and efforts to arrange bilateral talks.</p>
                    <p>31. But while the Soviets can shelve an issue like Berlin simply by ceasing
                        to agitate it, they have no means of unilaterally shutting off the
                        Sino-Soviet dispute. The Chinese show no disposition to stop pressing their
                        case, and Khrushchev is unwilling to make concessions important enough to
                        allow the two to compose their differences for a time. The present attempts
                        to convoke a meeting have been carried on in a remarkable public
                        correspondence filled with uncompromising restatements of position and
                        veiled threats and insults. We think that a conference, if it comes about,
                        will at most result in a superficial compromise which would be highly
                        vulnerable to the next turn of international events. Beyond these maneuvers,
                        the general outlook is for a continuing and widening estrangement between
                        the two powers in which both Soviet and Chinese nationalism will become
                        increasingly prominent.</p>
                    <p>32. In southeast Asia, differences with China, which include differences over
                        the tactics of “national liberation” struggle, have worked to complicate
                        Soviet policy. Because of the important position of the North Vietnamese as
                        the prime movers of Communist policy in both Laos and South Vietnam, the
                        Soviets are probably increasingly reluctant to oppose North Vietnamese
                        interests. The Soviets probably do not want to dissipate what influence they
                        have in Hanoi by constant intervention over secondary questions of local
                        tactics, particularly if in doing so they appear to be giving way to Western
                        pressures. On the other hand, the Soviets have broader interests and
                        problems which transcend those concerning Laos. Hence they would be loath to
                        give the North Vietnamese or Chinese a free hand to decide Communist policy.
                        On balance, even though the Soviets still probably prefer to maintain the
                        Geneva settlement, we think that they will be unable to respond to US and
                        British efforts to stabilize the Laotian situation unless US pressures
                        induce the local Communists to seek Soviet support.</p>

                    <p>33. It is wholly uncertain how long Soviet policy will focus on the tasks of
                        consolidation designed to prepare for a renewed offensive against the
                        non-Communist world. This depends on a number of factors, such as the
                        situation in the top leadership, the success of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s efforts to improve its relative military position, and
                        the opportunities for forward action opened up by developments abroad. An
                        aggravation of divisions in Europe and between Europe and the US, for
                        example, would encourage the Soviets to pursue more actively the
                        exacerbation of differences <pb n="697" xml:id="pg_697" facs="0725"/>in the
                        Western camp. General policy, moreover, might be heavily influenced by the
                        need to respond to some unexpected turn of events, such as a successful
                        Communist revolution in Latin America, the flaring up of a new Cuban crisis,
                        or an escalation of armed conflict in southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>34. In our last estimate of the future course of Soviet foreign policy,<note n="8" xml:id="d326fn8">
                            <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-9-62, “Trends in Soviet Foreign
                            Policy,” dated 2 May 1962, Secret. [Footnote in the source text; printed
                            as <ref target="#d187">Document 187</ref>.]</note> we examined the
                        possibility of a gradual evolution in the Soviet world outlook which would
                        diminish the importance of those conceptions of hostility derived from
                        Communist ideology. At that time, we judged it possible that, over a quite
                        unpredictable period of time, certain factors might force the Soviet leaders
                        to adopt a more “normal” approach to world politics, one giving greater
                        weight to national interests and conventional modes of international
                        behavior as these are understood in the West, and less to the effort to
                        expand indefinitely the area of Moscow's control. In this section, we
                        reconsider the nature and influence of these factors: the course of
                        developments inside the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, changing
                        relations within the Bloc and the Communist movement, and the movement of
                        events in the East-West competition.</p>
                    <p>35. Internal Developments. A year ago, we concluded that there was some
                        prospect of an evolutionary trend inside the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> which, by allowing public opinion to acquire a larger
                        influence, would have some moderating effect on the Soviet world outlook. We
                        have seen no significant movement over the last year, however, in the
                        direction of involving wider circles of opinion, presumably closer to the
                        aspirations of the general population, in Soviet policymaking. The regime
                        has laid new economic burdens on the consumer and, in Cuba, carried the
                        country into a risky and remote adventure irrelevant to the concerns and
                        desires of the people. These actions have probably cost the regime some of
                        the popular confidence and loyalty which it seeks, and the relatively bleak
                        outlook for the consumer in 1963 raises the possibility that demonstrations
                        of discontent may recur on the considerable scale of 1962. But these
                        reactions do not endanger the bases of regime control, and the recent
                        reaffirmation of military priorities in the allocation of economic resources
                        confirms that they remain only one factor, and evidently not a decisive one,
                        in the leadership's choice of policies.</p>
                    <p>36. We attach considerable long-run importance, however, to the climate of
                        opinion which, making use of the opportunities of de-Stalinization, has
                        manifested itself among Soviet writers and artists. The recent works of the
                        cultural intelligentsia, and their responses to critical attack, implicitly
                        and sometimes even explicitly reject the legitimacy of party authority in
                        the arts. More than this, in their strong affirmation of human <pb n="698" xml:id="pg_698" facs="0726"/>values and their condemnation of the
                        Stalinist past, they have formulated the hitherto unspoken question of the
                        present leadership's responsibility for the crimes of the 1930's and 1940's
                        and, consequently, its fitness to rule today. Implicit in their revolt is
                        also a repudiation of the way in which the party defines its historic
                        mission and its allegation that the Western world is inevitably hostile to
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>37. The regime has shown a special sensitivity to the intellectuals'
                        contention that the older generation does not deserve the respect of its
                        sons. It senses in this not only a criticism of individuals, but a
                        repudiation of the political achievements of the revolution to date. Current
                        measures of repression reflect party fears that these attitudes are
                        spreading to other groups, and there are signs that some students and
                        scientific-technical workers share the artists' outlook. In the face of the
                        present crackdown and demands for recantation, many of the rebellious
                        artists may not be able to sustain the collective insubordination which
                        their current silence represents. We believe, however, that their alienation
                        from the party leadership as presently constituted is profound, and that it
                        will continue to find expression so long as the regime remains unwilling, as
                        it appears to be at present, to resort to repressions which truly
                        terrorize.</p>
                    <p>38. Relations in the Communist World. In the past year, events have forced
                        the Soviet leadership to move considerably further away from the traditional
                        Communist view of Moscow as the undisputed center and order-giver for the
                        entire world movement. Even as they look beyond Mao Tse-tung to his
                        successors, they have little hope of being able to restore unity of action
                        with Communist China or to be relieved of the necessity to combat its
                        independent influence in parties and movements which earlier were exclusive
                        Soviet preserves. By force of various circumstances, they have had to extend
                        a special status to Cuba in the socialist camp and to watch Albania, North
                        Korea, North Vietnam, and the parties in non-Communist Asia move varying
                        distances out of their sphere of influence. In pursuing a rapprochement with
                        Tito, they have had to compromise their old demands of hegemony.</p>
                    <p>39. In all these ways the Soviets, responding to a pluralistic and
                        contradictory world, are practicing a political give-and-take which has less
                        and less relation to traditional techniques of Stalinist manipulation and to
                        the blacks and whites of Stalinist thought. We believe that this process
                        within the Communist movement has an eroding effect upon the basic Soviet
                        view of world politics as essentially a bipolar struggle of camp against
                        camp. The private discourse of Soviet citizens and officials frequently
                        reflects a recognition that, in some matters, Soviet interests parallel
                        those of the West rather than those of Communist China. It would be wrong,
                        we think, to interpret this trend as leading in the direction of a common
                        Soviet-Western front against China. But it is not unreasonable to expect
                        that the loosening of relationships inside the Communist world <pb n="699" xml:id="pg_699" facs="0727"/>will be a significant factor tending to
                        diminish the ideological ingredient in the Soviet outlook upon the
                        non-Communist world.</p>
                    <p>40. The Course of East-West Competition. In our last estimate, we singled out
                        the success or failure which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
                        foreign policy encounters as perhaps the most significant factor affecting
                        the Soviet outlook on the outside world. Since that time, the record
                        contains much more failure than success, but we do not perceive signs of any
                        fundamental Soviet reappraisal of the validity of their key doctrines. We
                        continue to believe, however, that the prolonged frustration of Soviet
                        objectives, particularly the more ambitious aims having to do with a
                        world-wide conflict of systems, holds some promise over the long run of
                        bringing the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> around to a view which
                        accepts the permanence of a pluralistic world. Conversely, it seems certain
                        that successes in expanding Soviet influence, major weakenings in Western
                        positions, and in particular any further advances of direct Communist rule
                        will act to confirm the more far-reaching hopes and expectations of the
                        Soviet leaders.</p>
                    <p>41. It is possible, however, that the experience of prolonged failure to
                        advance toward Communist objectives would bring to the fore the more
                        dogmatic elements in the Soviet outlook. But even if ideological hostility
                        should diminish in the long run, this would not bring an end to
                        international conflicts of interest or necessarily reduce the danger of
                        general war. On the contrary, even in these circumstances the requirements
                        of Soviet national security, prestige, and ambition, as seen by the Soviet
                        leaders and people, would still bring the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> into frequent collision with the interests of other
                        states. The most that could be expected would be that some issues would
                        become more tractable and negotiable, particularly those not deeply rooted
                        in the national interests of the Soviet state, and that the occasional
                        recognition of a measure of common interest with the West would not
                        invariably be stifled by ideological hostility.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">VI. The Question of Succession</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>42. A key uncertainty surrounding future Soviet policy arises from the
                        problem of the succession to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. The style, skill, and conceptions of the top
                        leader still play a major role in determining Soviet choices and in the
                        effectiveness with which policies are prosecuted. We think, for example,
                        that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s personal views and
                        attributes have been of major importance in shaping Soviet policies over the
                        past decade, and that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> under a
                        different leader might have posed significantly different problems to the
                        US.</p>
                    <p>43. The Soviet Party appears to be no better equipped with an accepted
                        mechanism for the designation of a successor and his orderly assumption of
                        power than it was a decade ago. The most likely sequence of events, in our
                        view, is a repetition of the post-Stalin experience, in which the late
                        leader's senior associates conduct a struggle for supremacy behind a facade
                        of collectivity. The main arena of conflict will be the leading <pb n="700" xml:id="pg_700" facs="0728"/>party organs, but unless a single figure
                        can gain control fairly soon, the contenders will probably try to bolster
                        their strength by appealing to important interest groups outside the
                        professional party apparatus. Of these groups, we believe that the economic
                        administration, weakened by continuing reorganizations, will be an even less
                        important political counter than when Malenkov tried to use it after 1953,
                        and the police would probably become a significant factor only in the event
                        that a succession struggle was prolonged and was accompanied by popular
                        unrest which enlarged the role of the security forces.</p>
                    <p>44. There is some reason to believe, however, that the military leadership
                        will be a substantial factor in post-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> maneuvering for power. The special efforts to
                        rehabilitate Stalin's military victims and military attempts to maximize
                        their own credit for World War II victories point to a strong sense of
                        corporate identity among the senior officers, although we also have evidence
                        of conflicts among the marshals. More important, the military leadership in
                        the last two years has increasingly asserted its own views, not always
                        unanimous, on questions of military doctrine and strategy; at times it has
                        seemed even to be giving its opinions a more general political import as
                        well. We do not believe that the military aspires to an independent
                        political role in Soviet politics, but if, as we expect, the military and
                        economic choices facing the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> become
                        more acute, the senior officers will probably find themselves more deeply
                        involved in matters of general policy. Indeed, there are some present
                        indications of party alarm on this score, and it is possible that, before
                        the succession question arises, steps will be taken to restrict the
                        political role of leading military personalities.</p>
                    <p>45. We know little about the individual policy views of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s colleagues. It is clear,
                        however, that the leadership is frequently divided over policy issues, and
                        the record of the succession struggles after Lenin and Stalin indicates that
                        divergent views on policy are heavily involved in innerparty competition. So
                        long as present trends continue in the economy, in the relationship of
                        East-West military power, in Bloc relations, and in Soviet fortunes abroad,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s heirs will confront
                        a number of acute issues and decisions. His departure would make it easier
                        to ditch some policies to which his personal prestige has been attached. But
                        it would aggravate most problems by bringing about an inevitable temporary
                        reduction of Soviet prestige, a loss of authority in the Communist movement,
                        and a general uncertainty in the country.</p>
                    <p>46. In such circumstances, it is normal for Soviet politicians to subordinate
                        their own views to expediency and to espouse those policies which seem most
                        likely to serve their personal ambitions. At the same time, a powerful
                        weapon in this competition is a comprehensive program which a leader can
                        represent as promising solutions to a broad range of problems confronting
                        the regime; to be without a program is a <pb n="701" xml:id="pg_701" facs="0729"/>grave weakness. Thus contenders for power are under
                        pressure to formulate competing proposals, designed to appeal to politically
                        important groups, on a number of issues. Initially the tendency would
                        probably be for more conservative elements to gain predominance, but the
                        longer a succession struggle remains unresolved, the more tendency there
                        would be for a wider range of alternative policies to be given active
                        consideration. This tendency creates the likelihood that, if the struggle
                        was protracted, the circle of political participation would also widen as
                        rivals reached out beyond the party elite for support.</p>
                    <p>47. Because of these factors, the period ushered in by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s departure may present special
                        opportunities and dangers to the US. Relations with the non-Communist world,
                        and particularly with the leading rival power, are likely to be among the
                        prime issues in any political competition, since these are intimately
                        related to military problems, economic difficulties, and the key questions
                        of China and Germany. We think it very unlikely that a “war party” will
                        emerge in the Kremlin; there is no evidence that other leaders take a less
                        sober view than <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> of the
                        consequences of nuclear war, and indeed some information indicates that the
                        military regard the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as inadequately
                        prepared at present to engage in one. But a faction may form which seeks to
                        meet the problems of internal discontent and Chinese pressure by placing
                        greater stress on factors of tension in East-West relations. It is also
                        possible that a succession struggle would generate arguments for some
                        accommodation with the West as a means of coping with these same problems.
                        At any rate, the US will almost certainly be assailed with contrary
                        indications, all of them difficult to interpret, and some of them suggesting
                        that important changes are possible depending on the attitude adopted by the
                        West. If <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s departure
                        occurs at a time when existing policies are enjoying poor results, the
                        succession period may in fact offer unusual chances for movement in Soviet
                        policy.</p>

                    <p>3039. During private conversation among Dobrynin, Smirnovsky, <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> and me at Spaso yesterday evening, both
                        Dobrynin and Smirnovsky pressed importance of substantive forward movement
                        in conversations starting July 28 with Secretary. Questioned as to relation
                        these talks with Sino-Soviet discussions starting July 5 both claimed latter
                        would have no effect on US-Soviet talks which should be considered
                        independently, with emphasis on necessity progress in US-Soviet dialogue.
                        Both made effort play down influence Sino-Soviet discussions on US-Soviet
                        relations, emphasizing fact Secretary's visit would take place later.
                        Otherwise refused to be drawn out on Moscow-Peiping conflict.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> pressed for Secretary to
                        have concrete proposals of some kind (without specifying subject) for his
                        conversations with “highest” Soviet officials. While declining to indicate
                        Soviet preparedness make similar positive suggestions, he emphasized that
                        Secretary's visit could not be considered sheer formality. Practical results
                        would have to be expected and mere repetition shop-worn positions could
                        actually result in set-back our relations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was not sure as to
                        relationship proposed nuclear discussions and Secretary's visit, but
                        accepted these might be considered preparatory. He pressed as to identity
                        high-level representatives and I said no information beyond that conveyed
                        orally to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> on occasion
                        delivery President's original letter. When he suggested might be Foster, I
                        agreed this possibility.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> failed to react to mention
                        of Berlin. As regards nuclear test ban, he reiterated well-established line
                        (including having reviewed with <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> at New York latter's cable re US agreement to two
                        or three inspections) of Soviet disappointment (even, perhaps, dismay, when
                        Soviet offer, which had been based on conviction it would be sufficient to
                        finalize matter, was not accepted. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SMN1">Smirnovsky</persName> both played on theme that this had been serious
                        set-back for those in government who advocate desirability and possibility
                        of finding areas of agreement with the United States).</p>
                    <p>As regards specifics Secretary's visit, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> indicated they expected initiative from us as to
                        timing and method announcement. He understood Secretary preferred about
                        three days, including one day at <pb n="703" xml:id="pg_703" facs="0731"/>Leningrad. Dobrynin noted that whereabouts <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might affect this schedule—if he in south an
                        additional day or so might be desirable. (In conversation with <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_SMN1">Smirnovsky</persName> stated that there would be no difficulty about
                        communications in event <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        talks took place outside Moscow since twice daily courier plane would
                        probably be arranged.)</p>
                    <p>Earlier conversation was devoted (by <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>) largely to subject District of Columbia permission
                        Soviet Embassy proceed with building plans—with heavy emphasis on
                        reciprocity and Soviet Government's preparedness proceed with our large
                        building project if their Washington deal approved.</p>

                    <p>On June 10, 1963, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                        delivered a speech on world peace at American University in Washington. He
                        called for a reexamination of the U.S. attitude toward the Soviet Union, the
                        cold war, and toward peace itself and for a recognition that total war made
                        no sense in the nuclear age. He asserted that “both the United States and
                        its allies, and the Soviet Union and its allies, have a mutually deep
                        interest in a just and genuine peace and in halting the arms race.” We
                        should “not be blind to our differences—but let us also direct attention to
                        our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be
                        resolved.” He announced that “high level discussions will begin shortly in
                        Moscow looking toward early agreement on a comprehensive test ban treaty”;
                        and “to make clear our good faith and solemn convictions on the matter,” he
                        declared that “the United States does not propose to conduct nuclear tests
                        in the atmosphere so long as other states do not do so. We will not be the
                        first to resume.” For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the

                    <p>In a meeting in Moscow on July 26—the day after the limited test ban treaty
                        had been initialed—Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> told Under Secretary of State for Political

                        “June 10 speech was best statement made by any President since Roosevelt.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> expressed the hope
                        that the “President would consolidate his position on basis that speech.
                        Positions expounded in that speech <pb n="704" xml:id="pg_704" facs="0732"/>were good and strong but should be made even stronger; those positions
                        promised yield good dividends both for President personally and for US in
                        general.” For text of telegram 365 from Moscow, July 27, in which <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> reported on the conversation, see

                    <p>Q. You gave as the mission of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> the double
                        function of evaluating both capabilities and intentions. In your rundown on
                        Russia vis-à-vis Western Europe, you gave us a good picture of its
                        capabilities in Western Europe. I would be interested in your evaluation as
                        to the Russian intentions in Western Europe, particularly with reference to
                        Berlin, which at the moment seems to be quiescent. What is your evaluation
                        of their intentions in Western Europe?</p>
                    <p>DCI: Yes, Berlin is quiet at the present time. We do not think that the
                        Soviets intend to move militarily in Western Europe in the foreseeable
                        future. We observe them in a high state of readiness, but we see no actions
                        which we would interpret as an intention to move militarily, nor to move
                        into Berlin and to accept the resultant confrontation. Now their policy with
                        respect to Berlin blows hot and cold, and I think is adjusted from time to
                        time because of internal pressures on the communist hierachy in Moscow. We
                        believe that as of the present time they are pretty well consumed with
                        internal problems, they are beset by the Soviet-Sino split, they are giving
                        some considerable attention to their 6,000 mile border, and we think that
                        all of these account for a rather quiet period. We see not very much in the
                        way of threats. Occasionally they rattle a missile or trot out a hundred
                        megaton bomb, or make a provocative statement at a Moscow cocktail party to
                        some worried diplomat. But generally speaking the <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0733"/>type of threat and extreme statement of the
                        last few years are not present at the moment. We attribute this to internal
                        problems which have them somewhat divided and hence not quite as decisive as
                        they have been in the past.</p>

                    <p>On June 14, 1963, the intelligence community issued <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 85-63, “Situation and Prospects in Cuba,” which stated: “On
                        balance, we estimate that there has been little or no reduction in overall
                        military capabilities in Cuba since the end of the missile crisis. The
                        Soviet military picture in Cuba is in transition with a scaling down of
                        their forces becoming apparent. The total Soviet military strength in Cuba
                        is now estimated to be about 12,000 to 13,000, but we cannot exclude the
                        possibility that there could be several thousand more. The Soviets remain in
                        control of the key weapons systems, while training the Cubans to operate
                        some of them. We believe the Soviets have told the Cubans that they intend
                        eventually to turn various weapons systems over to them. This is not to say
                        that all Soviet military personnel will be withdrawn from Cuba; indeed, it
                        is highly likely that the Soviets will maintain a significant presence
                        there.” The estimate also stated that it was “unlikely that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> contemplates an attempt to reintroduce
                        strategic missiles in Cuba. Continued US aerial surveillance remains a major
                        deterrent. We cannot, however, altogether rule out such an attempt.” For

                    <p>On June 14, 1963, the Committee of Principals discussed the upcoming trip to

                        had designated as his personal representative at the three-power test ban
                        talks that would begin July 15. According to the memorandum of conversation,
                            “<persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that the <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> mission was not based on
                        indications that the Soviets were prepared to move toward the kind of treaty
                        we wanted,” but “the President feels the mission should be made because this
                        may be our last chance to avoid a larger and more difficult arms race.” On
                        June 20 Carl <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kaysen</persName>, President's
                        Deputy Special Assistant for National Security Affairs, sent President

                        positions that <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> should take.
                        The paper argued that the initial part of the talks should deal with a
                        comprehensive test ban treaty but noted that the U.S. offer to sign a treaty
                        banning tests in the atmosphere, underwater, and in space remained open, and
                        conceded that a partial test ban treaty might be the best solution

                    <p>On 15 June, the Chinese delivered to the Soviets what will probably be the
                        last in the exchange of letters between them before the “unity” meeting
                        convenes in Moscow. The timing of the letter<note n="3" xml:id="d334fn3">For

                        its statements suggest that it was planned to coincide with the opening of
                        the Soviet central committee plenum opening on 18 June. However, its content
                        over-all—a long, intransigent position paper, insulting in tone and
                        bristling with unconcealed attacks on the Soviet party—seems intended more
                        for the international Communist movement than for Moscow. The letter not
                        only was printed in People's Daily on 17 June, but was immediately broadcast
                        around the world and has been published, along with the other letters in the
                        series, in a pamphlet which will undoubtedly be widely distributed wherever
                        Peiping feels it can exert an influence.</p>
                    <p>This last letter was an attempt by the Chinese to define more sharply the
                        differences between themselves and the “modern revisionists” over 25 points
                        of “principle” which they feel should be discussed at the Moscow meeting.
                        The issues range widely, from the mistaken view of general policy the
                        Chinese profess to see in Soviet words and actions; through the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s incorrect tactics in foreign policy,
                        its mishandling of problems in the international Communist movement, and its
                        exercise of “great-nation chauvinism” in respect to other Communist regimes;
                        to the degeneration of Marxism-Leninism in Soviet domestic doctrine and
                        society.</p>
                    <p>Peiping's decision to set forth in so stark a fashion its rigid,
                        fundamentalist views in opposition to the somewhat more liberal, pragmatic
                        Soviet approach reflects its arrogant confidence, perhaps over-confidence,
                            <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0738"/>that in the contest the tide of
                        opinion within the movement is flowing in the direction of China. The
                        Chinese methodology resembles Lenin's constant insistence on clearly marking
                        the boundaries between himself and the Menshiviks in their earlier
                        disruptive no-holds-barred ideological battle.</p>
                    <p>This approach entails some danger for the Chinese. Earlier in the dispute,
                        they generated a great deal of sympathy for their views when they
                        concentrated on fewer issues and presented them in a more generalized
                        fashion. Now that the range has been extended to Soviet practices and views,
                        the possibility of equivocation on the part of other Communist parties has
                        been narrowed.</p>

                        expressing the hope that the Chinese, like the Soviet Union, would
                        “concentrate their efforts on what unites” the two parties rather than on
                        what separates them. The statement also explained that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> at this time would not publish the
                        letter—which, like earlier Chinese communications, taunted the Soviets for
                        their failure to publish Peiping's views as the Chinese publish attacks on
                        themselves—since it would only lead to a renewal of bitter polemical
                        exchanges, which have aided in Chinese efforts to undermine Soviet
                        leadership.</p>
                    <p>In fact, for the most part, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has
                        lived up to its self-proclaimed ban on polemical attacks. While firmly
                        maintaining its well-known positions, so contrary to what the Chinese
                        preach, and continuing its efforts, as in its extravagant wooing of Castro
                        last month, to solidify support from others, it has not returned to the peak
                        pitch reached just before the East German party congress in January. Its
                        actions, however, or in some cases its refusal to act, have proved that it
                        remains as intransigent as the Chinese and consequently have infuriated
                        Peiping.</p>

                    <p>The Soviet-Yugoslav rapprochement, one of the key exhibits in the Chinese
                        case for Soviet revisionism, has continued to prosper, with Moscow even
                        praising Yugoslavia's new and controversial “socialist” constitution. A
                        recent report from a diplomat in Belgrade states that a Yugoslav delegation
                        will be in Moscow around 1 July to negotiate a role for Yugoslavia as
                        observer in the bloc economic organization <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>Soviet actions with respect to India also continue to contain a heavy
                        anti-Chinese flavor. In addition to its un-Marxist “neutrality” in the
                        Sino-Indian border question and its continuing deliveries of aircraft to the
                        Indians, Moscow now has reportedly offered them new military equipment,
                        which they would put to use in any future skirmishes with the Chinese on the
                        border. The Indians plan to send a technical mission to Moscow on 1 July, as
                        suggested by the Soviets, and plan, for their own purposes, to ensure that
                        the Chinese know of their visit.</p>
                    <p>In agreeing to meetings with US high-level negotiators in Moscow on 15 July
                        for further discussion of a nuclear test ban, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has shown in another field that it will pursue its own
                        policies with little regard for Chinese feelings or views. Although
                        prospects are slim for any better results in these than in earlier talks,
                        Peiping views with deep disapproval any Soviet negotiations with the West on
                        this and related subjects.</p>
                    <p>All these delegations to discuss agreements with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, which the Chinese view as inimical to their own
                        interests, will be in Moscow at approximately the same time as the two
                        Communist regimes face each other across their negotiating table. Such a
                        juxtaposition does not appear at all accidental and certainly will not
                        appear so to the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>Some of the Soviet actions have been met by the Chinese with an eloquent
                        silence. Although the final Soviet-Cuban communiqué was printed by People's
                        Daily there was no comment by Peiping on Castro's month-long trip in the
                        Soviet Union. Prior to that trip, Castro's activities had been widely
                        publicized by the Chinese. The forthcoming East-West negotiations in Moscow
                        were dismissed by China with a two-line announcement.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The Chinese are coldly vituperative about other matters, however. They have
                        issued a constant stream of protests alleging Indian violations of Chinese
                        territory, apparently building up a case of innocent injured party, and they
                        have again accused a “certain socialist country” of failing to support a
                        socialist ally when attacked by a bourgeois country. On 16 June, they
                        editorialized on the failure of the Geneva Conference co-chairmen (the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>) to condemn alleged Western and US violations of the
                        agreements on Laos. The editorial was obviously intended to demonstrate for
                        other Communist parties the sharp contrast between the proper Chinese
                        support for militancy in a revolutionary situation and the improper Soviet
                        caution.</p>
                    <p>It is on the question of Yugoslavia that the Chinese have vented their full
                        anger. After republishing an earlier Tito speech which had set forth
                        Yugoslavia's views of Chinese errors, People's Daily on 15 June savagely
                        attacked Yugoslav revisionism, carefully tarring the Soviet Union with the
                        same brush by implication. The Chinese proclaimed that Tito's views <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0740"/>were but “spittle collected from
                        the cuspidors of the imperialists and other revisionists”—an obvious
                        reference to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Both sides nevertheless continue to pay lip service to the need for “unity”
                        and proclaim loudly that they each are working to that end. Both are
                        apparently still ready to meet on 5 July as if that meeting could be
                        meaningful in terms of unity. The Chinese were the more honest, however, in
                        their editorial on Tito when they boldly said that their dispute with the
                        revisionists was “irreconcilable.”<note n="5" xml:id="d334fn5">In the July
                            26 issue, the Current Intelligence Weekly Review reported that “after
                            two weeks of futile and probably acrimonious meetings in Moscow, the
                            Chinese Communists have returned home clearly determined to carry on
                            with the war. The Russians, no less determined, have acted quickly to
                            tighten their lines in preparation for continued conflict.” (Central

                    <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, speaking in
                        Berlin on July 2, 1963, expressed Soviet “readiness to conclude an agreement

                        under water.” He also contended that “it would be advisable straightaway,
                        when an agreement on the cessation of nuclear tests is concluded, to take
                        also another big step towards the relaxation of international tension”:

                    <p>At a meeting of the National Security Council on July 9, according to the
                        summary record, “Secretary of State Rusk said our objective is to continue
                        to try for a comprehensive test ban treaty, accepting a three-environment
                        treaty only as a first step.” Rusk also raised the question of defining
                        “underground tests and atmospheric tests in such a way as to make clear when
                        an underground test becomes an atmospheric test.” Arms Control and
                        Disarmament Agency Director Foster replied that definitions of these tests
                        were contained in the draft treaty (which banned tests “if such explosion
                        causes radioactive debris to be present outside the territorial limits of
                        the State” conducting the test). Seaborg stated that “our present
                        underground tests would be legal under this definition.” For text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v07">

                        following day. “Our judgment that a test ban treaty is in the national
                        interest rests on two grounds. First, it may be a significant first step
                        toward the halting of the arms race and thus reduce international tensions.
                        Second, and more important, it is an indispensable first step toward the
                        limitation of the further diffusion of nuclear weapons.” The instructions
                        continued, “<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s speech makes
                        it unlikely that we can reach agreement with the Soviets on a comprehensive
                        treaty at this time. Therefore, we should seek an agreement banning testing
                        in three environments along the lines of the August 27, 1962, draft treaty.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> was also instructed to

                        governments would prefer comprehensive test ban but that we would be
                        prepared to agree to test ban in three environments without inspection, as a
                        first step towards the comprehensive agreement.” <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> suggested a series of other steps, such as
                        “freezing of military budgets at 1963 levels” and an “agreement on level of
                        armed forces now located in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.” <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then agreed that France could be dropped from the
                        Soviet draft of the test ban treaty as an original signatory after <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> accepted his contention that it
                        was important for France to join after the treaty had been concluded.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did not press
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> on a non-aggression
                        pact. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> concluded: “It seems
                        quite clear to me that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is
                        ready to go ahead with three environment test ban without <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss>.” For text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v07">

                    <p>In telegram 195 to the Department, July 18, <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> reported that he was “beginning to piece together a
                        logical theory on why <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is
                        interested in test ban at this time. Obviously, his first preoccupation is
                        his battle with ChiComs and particularly effect on Soviet leadership of
                        international Communist movement. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wants to use the test ban treaty in this
                        connection. Since he is unable to get the ChiComs to agree to join the test
                        ban, he will attempt to isolate them. He will attempt to get the maximum
                        number of nations to adhere to test ban treaty, thus leaving China isolated
                        if possible as the only nation refusing to cooperate on this highly
                        emotional subject to underdeveloped nations.” For text, see ibid., pages
                        808-809.</p>
                    <p>The limited test ban treaty was initialed on July 25 and signed in Moscow on
                        August 5. For further information on the negotiations, see ibid., pages
                        801-856. For text of the treaty and the tripartite communiqué issued on July

                        on September 24; instruments of ratification were exchanged and the treaty
                        entered into force on October 10.</p>

                    <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> reminisced at length
                        about Stalin's night-owl habits. Said they were killing. Stalin called
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> at times to come to
                        dinner at 2:00 a.m. Stalin slept like a horse all day—ate, and went to sleep
                        again. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said the great
                        banquets of Stalin were a menace as they had to work all day. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> spoke of Stalin drinking too
                        much at dinner for General <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        in December 1944. (I was there and didn't think Stalin drank too much.
                        General <persName corresp="#p_DAH1">Dean</persName>, also present, had
                        agreed. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> freely confessed
                        he had gone to sleep during the movie. W.A.H.) <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> commented Stalin thought he was God on earth, and
                        used to say capitalists would strangle the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> after his death. But here we were alive and drinking
                        cognac with capitalists and they were not strangling the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Also, Stalin was a very poor judge of
                        people and in speaking of who would be his successor always pointed at
                        Bulganin; <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said Bulganin
                        was a nice man but not one possessing broad vision.</p>
                    <p>2. Re <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss> meeting which ended today,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said it had gone very
                        well and everybody had parted well satisfied. In response to <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s question about Rumanians,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said numerous press
                        reports about the Rumanian situation were all beside the point. Even
                        completely ignorant people could see that Soviet-Rumanian cooperation was
                        not to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s unilateral advantage at
                        Rumanian expense. Soviets had built something like ten or more plants in
                        Rumania and were buying their products. If Soviets had wanted to draw
                        unilateral advantage, they would have built those plants in their own
                        country and would be now selling at a profit products produced by those
                        plants to Rumania. The same situation applied to other Socialist countries
                        in Europe. Commented that in capitalist countries, where there were
                        difficulties with investing capital within the country, it was normal to
                        export capital, but this was not the case with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Reiterated what he had said at July 15 meeting with
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>
                        <note n="2" xml:id="d339fn2">Telegram 154 from Moscow, July 16, is a 20-page
                            account of the July 15 meeting. (Ibid., DEF 18-3 <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> (MO)); reproduced in the microfiche

                        he had quoted at that meeting—6 billion rubles in chemical fertilizer and 11
                        billion in synthetics, all in about five or six years. Said Soviets wished
                        buy chemical plant equipment in US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
                        other Western countries. Of course, US was now unwilling engage in trade
                        with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> but that would do no harm to
                        Soviets; indeed his trade people told him that US produced equipment more
                        expensive than similar equipment produced in <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, West Germany or Italy. He thought reason for that was that
                        US had highest wages. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Germany, etc., were lending money for
                        equipment new plants for five years. Now Soviets will not borrow except
                        seven or even ten years, because now too many repayments.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> commented Soviet
                        relations with Afghanistan were very good and there were no difficulties
                        whatsoever between two countries. Thought King of Afghanistan was a good man
                        who understood problems correctly and was very modest and even shy.</p>
                    <p>4. Re Soviet-Iranian relations, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said they had improved somewhat but they would be
                        even better if US did not poke its nose in this area. When <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> remarked Shah had just instituted
                        great reforms in Iran, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        commented they were “bold reforms.” Said Shah had common sense but was too
                        self-confident, which was bad if carried to extreme. Noted Soviets had some
                        time ago settled border problems with Iran which had existed for 70 years.
                        Said he had instructed his people to make concessions to Iran, telling them
                        they would be only temporary as sooner or later Iran would have a Soviet
                        regime and then there would be no problem. He said an eventual revolution in
                        Iran was inevitable.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said Stalin told him he
                        had little confidence in Mao. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-Chinese relations were now of course aggravated, but prior to
                        that they were better than relationship between Stalin and Mao. When
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> referred to
                        Soviet-Chinese border disputes, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that was due to fact that in some areas
                        Soviet-Chinese border was still unmarked. Thought effort should be made to
                        place markers along the border. Said some areas were indicated on Soviet
                        maps as belonging to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and on Chinese
                        maps as belonging to China. This was due to different interpretation of
                        situation, but in any event only minor areas were involved. Later in
                        conversation, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> commented
                        that if the Chinese could get by without the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Soviets could also get by without Chinese.</p>
                    <p>6. When <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> referred to recent
                        press reports that Chinese were preparing another invasion of India,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he had not seen
                        such reports. Said Soviets had said privately and publicly they were opposed
                        to Chinese attitude in this matter, which had made Chinese angry. Expressed
                        hope Chinese would have enough common sense not to engage in invasion again
                        as that would only harm cause of peace.</p>
                    <pb n="718" xml:id="pg_718" facs="0746"/>
                    <p>7. In response to <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s question,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, whispering in his
                        ear, said no decision had yet been made as to who would be his successor.
                        Said they were still weighing that decision, but commented <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> (who was also at the table) was a
                        very capable man, with background in engineering and with good knowledge of
                        political and economic problems; also mentioned Podgorny as a very capable
                        man. Noted, however, he had not lost hope that <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName> would recover, although it was difficult to entertain
                        such hope. Said <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName> was paralyzed
                        in his left side (both his left arm and left leg paralyzed) but could speak
                        and his mind was clear. In any event, if <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName> should recover, his recovery would take a long
                        time.</p>
                    <p>8. Referring to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> remark
                        during dinner that he wished send nice present to Attorney General <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> on occasion birth his eighth child,
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> Attorney General would be most
                        pleased if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would allow Mr.
                        Zaslovsky, husband of a very nice American girl, to join his wife in US.
                        Said Zaslovskys were young people who were very much in love; Mrs.
                        Zaslovsky, nee Stern, was now in <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                        wished very much be able return to her homeland with her husband. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> pointed out Attorney General was
                        very much interested in this case.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he knew nothing about
                        this case. When <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> turned to
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, latter said he knew but
                        preferred to say on this occasion that he did not. When <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> repeated Attorney General's
                        interest in this matter, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said
                        he would use very convenient American phrase “I will look into it.”</p>

                        occurred to you. In addition I am admittedly drawing upon my many years of
                        experience in the Soviet field and therefore stepping somewhat outside of my
                        present area of responsibility. However, this is in the belief that my views
                        on the consequences of the test ban agreement and certain caveats in
                        connection with <pb n="719" xml:id="pg_719" facs="0747"/>future deals with
                        Soviets may be sufficiently useful to warrant the message. There is of
                        course the added factor of the effect upon our European Allies and our
                        European policy of the manner in which we conduct our future relations with
                        the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>We should recognize that in itself the Soviet agreement to a test ban in the
                        three environments represents no concession whatsoever on their part. I was
                        particularly glad to see the President make this point so definitely in his
                        speech of last night.<note n="2" xml:id="d340fn2">For text of the
                            President's address to the American people on July 26, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States:
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">John F. Kennedy</persName>,
                                1963</hi>, pp. 601-606.</note> We have therefore no moral or any
                        other obligation to make any quid pro quo in any other field. I emphasize
                        this point since I seem to detect in some of the Soviet propaganda a
                        tendency to regard the test ban as a Soviet concession to be compensated for
                        by the U.S. and U.K. in other fields, especially the non-aggression pact.
                        This, as you well know is a favorite Soviet device to pretend concession
                        where none exists in order to extract a quid pro quo when none is merited.
                        In the circumstances it is extremely important that we so comport ourselves
                        with our Allies to avoid any semblance of impression that we have incurred
                        any indirect obligation with the Soviets in regard to non-aggression
                        arrangements. We should also avoid any appearance of indecent or anxious
                        haste in an attempt to move forward in the entire field of relations with
                        the Soviet Union. It has never been true in Soviet policy and is not now
                        true that certain occasions must be seized or the opportunity is lost.
                        Soviet policy is too realistic and based upon long-range considerations for
                        that. It is therefore not a question of seizing a temporary fleeting
                        opportunity. In fact I should think that we should proceed very cautiously
                        with any further discussions with the Soviet Union and wait for them to give
                        us indications of any serious change in current Soviet policy and not feel
                        that we must take the initiative in order “to show good faith”.</p>
                    <p>An approach such as I have outlined above seems to me extremely important to
                        keep steady our relations in Europe, as there is a strong tendency,
                        particularly in France, to believe that we are ready to patch up our
                        differences with the Soviet Union, even at the expense of European
                        interests. This I gather is also feared in Germany.</p>
                    <p>While I certainly would be the last person to wish to ignore any real or
                        serious opportunity for a meaningful solution of any of the outstanding
                        problems with the Soviet Union, I am sure you understand that if we are too
                        single minded in our relentless pursuit of improvement in relations with the
                        Soviet Union we will render correspondingly more difficult the problem of
                        the development of Atlantic association and most of the questions at present

                    <p>404. Eyes only—Secretary. I believe it may be helpful to you as you prepare
                        for your visit to Moscow to have Embassy's estimate as to subjects most
                        likely on Sov agenda, as well as some suggestions on topics you may wish to
                        raise. With this in mind, I submit following checklist of issues, together
                        with an indication of predictable Sov positions and some ideas on how you
                        may wish to respond:</p>
                    <p>1. <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss>. As <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> made clear in his July 26<note n="2" xml:id="d341fn2">See <ref target="frus1961-63v06">

                        on Sov agenda. I assume that principal point you will wish to make is that
                        consultation with allies now in train and until process completed you have
                        little to add to <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s remarks
                        on subject. Meanwhile, you may wish, before your departure, publicly to
                        correct deliberate misinterpretation which Sovs have placed on
                            communiqué<note n="3" xml:id="d341fn3">See <ref target="#d338">Document

                        commentary subsequent to initialing of test-ban pact—namely claim that in
                        joint communiqué, US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> agreed continue
                        discussion of <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> following consultation
                        with allies, whereas only commitment in communique is to consult with allies
                        in view to further discussion of Sov <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss>
                        proposal. Secondly, you may wish to refer to K's “corns” remarks to
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>
                        <note n="4" xml:id="d341fn4">For a report of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s remarks about stepping on U.S. corns in

                        nonaggression commitments in atmosphere of threats against Berlin in
                        communications of truly aggressive <pb n="721" xml:id="pg_721" facs="0749"/>nature. Point here obviously is absence of logic and justice in Sov
                        position which insists on <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> divorced from
                        assurances that commitments would not extend to neuralgic point of Berlin.
                        Finally, you may wish, in view of K's remarks to <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> on point, to set record straight on US position
                        toward German borders.<note n="5" xml:id="d341fn5">From 4:05 to 4:30 p.m.,

                    </p>
                    <p>2. Partial measures. I think you should be in a position to say something
                        about the partial measures which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> mentioned in his July 19 speech,<note n="6" xml:id="d341fn6">For text of this speech, see <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi>, July 20,
                            1963.</note> if only to convey our ideas on forum for their further
                        consideration. It seems to me that, while agreeing to preliminary discussion
                        on a bilateral basis of partial measures, you would wish to point out that
                        since they affect number of other countries, perhaps best forum for their
                        systematic consideration would be Geneva 18-Nation Committee.</p>
                    <p>On first-step measures which we favor, such as nuclear cut-off and reduction
                        stockpiles, you will have noted from K's remarks to <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> he has no interest whatever in
                        latter and sees little merit in cut-off. It appears tough Sov position on
                        both issues stems from refusal consider any measure which would involve more
                        than bare minimum inspection, if that. On the question of non-dissemination,
                        Sovs would reject any formula which in their view would seem to give their
                        blessing to any German access to nuclear weapons, i.e., <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MNF1">MNF</gloss>.
                        Thus, it seems clear Sov tactics will be to press for maximum commitment on
                        our part re retention of control and will consider oral assurances on this
                        question more satisfactory to them than any formal agreement.</p>
                    <p>3. Laos. As <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> informed bluntly
                        by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, the Sov current
                        position on Laos is that the co-chairmen and external signatories'
                        responsibilities for fulfillment of the Geneva Accords have ended and that
                        the problem in Laos is now an internal one, requiring for its solution
                        agreement among the three Princes without interference from the outside.
                        Obviously we should not permit the Sovs thus to shirk the responsibilities
                        they assumed at Vienna, and I assume you will wish to press them again to
                        deal more firmly with outside forces responsible for the current crisis,
                        principally the North Vietnamese.</p>
                    <p>4. Cuba. While the Sovs are not likely to raise this subject, you may wish to
                        restate for their benefit US policy toward Cuba and perhaps seek more
                        concrete assurances on removal of Sov troops than thus far received. We
                        should have no illusions on our chances of success in this area. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> must have paid a price for
                        Castro's support of Sov's position in their dispute with ChiComs and his
                        commitment in Cuba may permit him little maneuverability. Even so, it may be
                        salutary to remind <pb n="722" xml:id="pg_722" facs="0750"/>him that
                        continued Sov attempts to shore up Castro, especially militarily, will
                        inevitably cast deep shadow over US-Sov relations.</p>
                    <p>5. Trade. Trade is a hardy perennial which Sovs are bound to raise,
                        especially in light of President's indication in his letter of Oct 27<note n="7" xml:id="d341fn7">Reference is apparently to <ref target="frus1961-63v06">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961-1963, vol. VI</ref>,
                            pp. 181-182; however, that letter contains no reference to trade.</note>
                        US would be prepared to review trade policy in event amelioration
                        international situation. Sovs will undoubtedly argue agreement on test-ban
                        is substantial fulfillment this condition. You will want to stress that it
                        is the arbitrary trade practices of the Sov bloc and lack attractive exports
                        which are primarily responsible for low-level trade and not, as Sovs always
                        allege, US strategic trade controls. You will have noted recent Sov keen
                        interest in development chemical industry, and, toward this end, expression
                        of hopes of obtaining equipment from West. (At Kremlin yesterday, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> told Freeman he was prepared buy
                        fertilizer, herbicide, and mixed-feed plants from us if price were
                            right.)<note n="8" xml:id="d341fn8">A memorandum of Freeman's
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> on

                            practices and prospects, was transmitted as an attachment to airgram
                            A-140 from Moscow, August 2. (Department of State, Central Files, ORG 7
                            AGR)</note> It would be helpful if you could here strike a positive
                        note, preferably with some concrete indication shift in US policy with
                        regard export equipment essentially directed to increase in benefits to Sov
                        people, e.g., agricultural and consumers goods production. Moreover, I would
                        think it desirable in our current examination of trade policy to consider
                        how best we might further influence reorientation of Sov economic
                        development, including distribution of resources in directions best
                        calculated to advance long-term interests.</p>
                    <p>In addition above comments on broad issues, following thoughts on issues of
                        strictly bilateral interest may be helpful:</p>
                    <p>1. Communications: I recommend you be prepared to follow up <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s initiative with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> by stressing importance in interest
                        rapid communications of acquisition by Embassy of leased cable. According to
                        Embassy's analysis of traffic during <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> talks, average time for transmittal
                        Washington-Moscow of messages bearing operational immediate designator was
                        about three hours and for outgoing messages one and half to two hours, with
                        maximum time being four hours in case of incoming messages and five and half
                        hours in case of outgoing messages. In preparation for your discussion this
                        subject, it might be useful for Department to make similar survey of time
                        lag its outgoing and incoming messages. Naturally, our claim to special
                        facilities would be strengthened if you were in a position to infer that
                        unless favorable Sov reaction forthcoming you would regretfully be obliged
                        to take steps to cut off or effect slow-down in US commercial facilities
                        which now <pb n="723" xml:id="pg_723" facs="0751"/>guarantee speedy and
                        reliable communications to Sov Mission New York. A gentle hint of
                        retaliation would do no harm, in my view.</p>
                    <p>2. Civil Air Agreement. As <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> has
                        in past, Sovs may link our request for special communications facilities
                        with Civil Air Agreement (see Embtel 1763).<note n="9" xml:id="d341fn9">Dated January 18. (Ibid., 911.2161/1-1863)</note> In Sov
                        view—essentially correct, I believe—US is committed to inaugurate civil air
                        service. You may wish confirm this also our understanding and give some
                        indication as to when agreement may be implemented.</p>
                    <p>3. Exchanges. You may wish note that negotiations for extension current
                        exchange agreement are scheduled for fall and express hope that Sovs will
                        take positive attitude on expansion of program of mutually advantageous
                        exchange of ideas and information. In this connection, you may wish to
                        comment favorably on recent Sov cessation jamming <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> and point out while this encouraging development, much more
                        needs be done in area of information exchange if genuine understanding among
                        peoples, which Sovs profess to support, is to be achieved. Obviously your
                        position on jamming question would be strengthened if, before hand, question
                        of use of 173 kilocycle frequency could be settled satisfactorily (see
                        Embtel 348).<note n="10" xml:id="d341fn10">Dated July 26. (Ibid., TEL 8-4

                        to me deep Sov concern over Egorov case and possible repercussions on
                        US-Soviet relations, and I would assume <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> will take equally vigorous line with you (see Embtel
                            241).<note n="11" xml:id="d341fn11">Dated July 21. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> 12 <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>)

                            reported Kuznetzov's representations to <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> on the case at a reception on July 20.</note> I
                        think you should be prepared to give detailed exposition US side of issue
                        and, if possible, indicate possibility that once judicial process has run
                        course, case may be disposed of in manner satisfactory to both sides.</p>
                    <p>5. Miscellaneous issues. I assume that you will wish to refer to our request
                        for allocation of suitable tract for new embassy property, as well as
                        perennial problem of exit visas for relatives US citizens. You may also wish
                        to remind Sovs of our continuing interest in establishment consulates and
                        consular convention, pointing out that we have heard nothing on subject
                        since submitting our comments on Sov draft a year ago.</p>
                    <p>It has occurred to us that since we so rarely have opportunities for direct
                        presentation our views and positions to Sov people, you may wish to consider
                        desirability of soliciting Sov views on TV appearance. If you think well of
                        idea, I would suggest that I approach Gromyko referring frequent Sov
                        appearances American TV. It might be useful further to refer to usual
                        practice of Secretary of State when abroad to hold press conference, <pb n="724" xml:id="pg_724" facs="0752"/>and suggest this also be carried
                        live on Sov TV. If Sovs should concur, I would think it useful for you to
                        take opportunity to set forth in nonpolemical terms our concept of peaceful
                        co-existence, which would mean above all a sincere plea for free exchange of
                        ideas and information in interest mutual understanding. Since Sovs should be
                        given as much advance notice as possible, I would hope you could give this
                        suggestion your immediate attention.<note n="12" xml:id="d341fn12">On August

                    <p>The President met with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                        in the Cabinet Room to discuss the Secretary's trip to Moscow. Also present
                        were: Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>,

                        The meeting lasted for approximately 45 minutes.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary went through the points listed in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>'s memorandum of August 1<note n="2" xml:id="d342fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>'s memorandum stated
                            that “the primary aim of the Secretary's visit will be to probe Soviet
                            intentions and to try to ascertain in what particular field further
                            progress in resolving issues with the Soviet Union might be made.”
                            (Ibid., Meetings and Memoranda Series, Meetings with the President)
                            Points 2-10 briefly discussed non-aggression arrangements, disarmament,
                            non-dissemination, Laos, Germany and Berlin, summitry, trade, bilateral
                            questions, and Cuba, respectively.</note> on the agenda for the
                        Secretary's visit to Moscow. The following points received particular
                        emphasis in the discussions:</p>
                    <p>1. With respect to a ban on bombs in orbit (3e), the Secretary raised the
                        difficulties that might arise if there were bilateral talks on this subject,
                        while the test ban treaty ratification process was going on. The President
                        agreed. However, he urged that we explore the possibility of reaching an <pb n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0753"/>agreement, rather than merely
                        resting on independent parallel declarations, in a positive way. A final
                        decision could be reserved for a later time.</p>
                    <p>2. On Laos (5), the Secretary indicated that his intention was to press the
                        Soviets hard on this issue, pointing out their responsibilities and asking
                        that they discuss with the Poles the need for a more cooperative attitude by
                        their representative in the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. The
                        President observed that it might be more useful to warn the Soviets that we
                        will act if necessary in order to preserve the neutralist government. Faced
                        with this prospect, the Soviets may be willing to try to do more under the
                        Accords. In any event, they would be put on notice and have no legitimate
                        basis for complaint or counter-action to any action we feel must be taken by
                        us.</p>
                    <p>3. On Summitry (7), the President observed that it would be better if
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> didn't come to the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Secretary remarked on <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s suggestion that the 20th
                        anniversary meeting of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in 1965 be held
                        at a Heads of State level. The President indicated this would be preferable
                        to having <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> [<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>?] coming this fall.</p>
                    <p>4. Trade (8). Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> pointed out the
                        political restrictions on development of trade and the present legislative
                        obstacles to its development. He also said that Russia's desires were
                        limited, but we could well meet them in the fields of technology. In
                        response to the President's question on whether there were trade experts in
                        the Secretary's party, the Secretary observed that it would be undesirable
                        for us to appear to be pressing the trade subject with the Soviets at this
                        time. There had already been some newspaper speculation about the connection
                        between the test ban agreement and talks on trade which he thought it
                        undesirable to encourage further. It was his judgment that the Senators in
                        the party might well raise the issue informally, or respond favorably to
                        Soviet questions on it.</p>
                    <p>5. On bilateral questions, (9) there was some discussion of the civil air
                        agreement. The Secretary pointed out we were essentially committed to
                        concluding the agreement, which we had already initialed, since the
                        atmosphere was sufficiently improved over that of the summer of 1961. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> suggested that we go
                        ahead on this after the ratification process. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> gave <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>'s views on the desirability of concluding the
                        agreement, as well as pointing out the irrelevancy of a bilateral agreement
                        to our arguments with African and Latin American countries against accepting
                        Soviet civil air routes. Our most persuasive argument in these places was
                        the lack of reciprocal advantage to the host countries. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> also pointed out that Pan Am would
                        like to wait for spring to begin service, to give time for promotion, which
                        in their judgment was needed to make the route an economic proposition. The
                        Secretary concluded by remarking that he proposed to take a positive
                        attitude in this matter.</p>
                    <p>6. Cuba (10). The President said that he did not foresee any useful response
                        from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> if we brought up Cuba
                        again. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        <pb n="726" xml:id="pg_726" facs="0754"/>would only repeat that U.S. and
                        Cuba should normalize their relations. It is clear that while <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is looking for a detente in
                        Europe, he proposes to increase the pressures in Latin America. (In
                        reviewing this minute, the President said that of course the Secretary
                        should raise the matter with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> just the same.)</p>
                    <p>7. The discussion then moved on to non-aggression arrangements (2). The
                        President made a number of points. First, while there appeared to be little
                        in such arrangements for us, we should keep an affirmative position and try
                        to maintain the mood which <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s
                        visit created. On the other hand, it was clear that we had to get finished
                        with the test ban treaty before we could do anything further on this
                        subject. It was important to find out what the Soviets saw in this
                        proposition, and whether such arrangements could give us additional security
                        in Berlin.</p>
                    <p>8. He asked for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>'s
                        comments, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> pointed
                        out the disadvantages of any non-aggression arrangement in its impact on the
                        Allies and in particular the Germans. The President noted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> had a different view and asked him
                        to state it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> pointed out
                        the consequences of a detente in permitting a further loosening of ties
                        between the satellites and the Soviet Union. This would apply to East
                        Germany as well, and make more possible an improvement in the East German
                        situation along the lines that Brandt had asked for. He spoke of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s concern over a possible
                        repetition of the 1953 uprising in East Germany, and urged that we had the
                        same concern. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> commented
                        on the Italian reaction to the proposals for a non-aggression pact in terms
                        of this as a further step in legitimizing the Italian Communist Party.</p>
                    <p>9. The President observed that while Berlin was not now in trouble and in his
                        judgment, did not seem likely to be in the near future, the connection
                        between an improvement in the Berlin situation and a non-aggression pact was
                        one that was useful for us to maintain in terms of our relations with the
                        Germans. The President said that while it was important to deal with the
                        West German problem, he thought that <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>'s views were too negative, and we should have a more
                        positive attitude. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>
                        pointed out again the difficulties which a non-aggression pact would create
                        in the Alliance and its effect in discouraging hope in East Germany, and
                        suggested that if we ran up against a dead end in our negotiations with the
                        Allies, we might try unilateral <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        declarations. On the other hand, he agreed that if we could make a gain in
                        Berlin, it would be useful, and warned that it is likely that the Soviets
                        will soon incorporate East Berlin into East Germany if they do not get a
                        non-aggression pact. The Secretary doubted whether a mere declaration by
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would answer <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s needs.</p>
                    <p>10. Discussion then turned to the problems of getting the Federal Republic to
                        sign the test ban treaty. The President said he thought it is <pb n="727" xml:id="pg_727" facs="0755"/>very important to get them to sign, both
                        from a domestic point of view and from the point of view of the Soviets.
                        There were some discussions of the way that the questions raised by the
                        Germans in the last few days could be answered. The Secretary said that
                        these questions reflected as much on Von Brentano's political attitude
                        toward Schroeder<note n="3" xml:id="d342fn3">Gerhard Schroeder, West German
                            Foreign Minister, who replaced Heinrich von Brentano in October

                        general. The Secretary pointed out that while Von Brentano was Foreign
                        Minister, Germany had adhered to several conventions to which East Germany
                        had also adhered. Further, Secretary of State Dulles had taken note of East
                        Germany's adherence to the Prisoner-of-War Convention and stated that on
                        this matter, the U.S. was in treaty relations with East Germany.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that the Secretary should not say anything on East German
                        adherence at the time the treaty was signed, in view of what the President
                        had already said at his press conference.<note n="4" xml:id="d342fn4">For a

                        meetings. (Aug. 4) At British Embassy today, Secretary and Lord Home had
                        general exchange of views on tactics to be followed in separate bilaterals
                        as well as trilaterals with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>

                    <p>Secretary expressed view that principal purpose in upcoming talks with Sovs
                        should be to prove whether Sovs genuinely interested in moving toward
                        détente or simply at this point concerned with atmospherics. At same time,
                        particularly in context Sov preoccupation with non-aggression pact, we
                        should make clear we expect Sov compliance with existing commitments—e.g.,
                        Laos as well as Sov avoidance aggressive behavior in other potential trouble
                        spots—e.g., Berlin. In any case we must be careful to avoid any impression
                        of commitments re <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> or partial measures
                        affecting Allies which would cause trouble particularly with Bonn and/or
                        would hamper <gloss target="#t_TB1">TB</gloss> ratification process in US.
                        Meanwhile, we should attempt in our tactical handling of proposals in which
                        Sovs have indicated primary interest to avoid seeming completely negative
                        and thus keep ball in play. Secretary's recommendation would be:</p>
                    <p>(1) Seek ascertain real Sov motivation for vigorous <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> campaign;</p>
                    <p>(2) Stress need for close consolation with Allies as precondition to further
                        discussion beyond probing stage;</p>
                    <p>(3) Express interest in some Sov partial measures and seek clarification
                        particularly on Sov proposals for exchange of observers and fixed-control
                        posts, pointing out our reluctance to give favorable consideration such
                        steps if narrowly confined—e.g., to Germany; and</p>
                    <p>(4) Suggest further examination both Sov and West partial measures could be
                        most usefully pursued in <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss>. (To assuage
                        possible German and French concern at discussion measures affecting them in

                    <p>Lord Home said British had hoped in upcoming talks we could take more
                        positive attitude in order “maintain momentum” and that impression of
                        progress could be reflected in communiqué.<note n="2" xml:id="d343fn2">For

                        Secretary's formula in view of obvious uneasiness on part our Allies,
                        particularly Bonn. Home said he felt compelled raise non-dissemination issue
                        since <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> publicly committed do so. Sovs
                        would undoubtedly counter with insistence on assurances against spread to
                        Germany via <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, and, if so, Home promised

                        controlling spread despite known British lack of enthusiasm for idea. On
                        Laos, Home, in his capacity as co-chairman, would press for more active Sov
                        role and particularly for assurance more cooperative behavior on part of
                        Polish member <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> although in view <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s statements in <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s talks doubted if they would be
                        forthcoming. Secretary urged Home to take particularly strong line with
                        Soviets on Laos; he himself intended take vigorous issue with Soviet
                        contention, <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0757"/>conveyed to <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>, that they considered their

                        would believe Sovs had been invaded. We had had numerous requests from
                        people wanting to come. Secretary then observed many in US group were in

                        greatly pleased with and <pb n="730" xml:id="pg_730" facs="0758"/>thankful
                        for warm hospitality they were accorded. Secretary then said he was looking
                        forward to discussions with representatives of Sov Govt during his stay in

                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> thanked for Sec's kind
                        words and for President's good wishes. He was also grateful to President for
                        his correct evaluation of historic act taking place this afternoon. While he
                        did not wish overestimate significance <gloss target="#t_TB1">TB</gloss>
                        Treaty per se—it was only small beginning—it laid foundation for further
                        steps in right direction. One could not undertake a major project in one
                        full swoop, but rather had to proceed in steps. In this connection, one
                        could imply analogy of procedures used in felling big oak tree; could not
                        fell a big tree by simply axing it down but had to make appropriate cuts in
                        appropriate sequence and with appropriate instruments. Problems two sides
                        were to resolve were extremely difficult, particularly taking into account
                        fact that systems of two sides were different and antagonistic and that in
                        dialogue between two sides many expressions of animosity were used.
                        Therefore both sides have to act like a mother teaching her child to walk;
                        if she pushed child, he would fall, but what mothers usually do is hold
                        their child by hand and teach him how to walk before child can learn how to
                        run.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said although <gloss target="#t_TB1">TB</gloss> Treaty a small step, it constituted an act of
                        historic significance and expressed hope further steps would follow. He said
                        Sovs appreciated greatly efforts by President, Secretary, and all other US
                        citizens who supported this kind of endeavor. As for <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, it had been and was making efforts at
                        solving other problems by peaceful means, because they believe war could not
                        resolve those problems. What must be done was develop trade, economic ties,
                        and cultural relations, for such things brought joy to man; as to arms race,
                        it should be stopped since it could lead only to catastrophe. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then again welcomed Secretary
                        and entire US group.</p>
                    <p>Secretary responded by thanking <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> for his welcome and then noted <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> quite right in saying our two
                        systems were different. Recalled <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had said that neither Sovs could persuade US nor
                        could US persuade <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> interjected this was quite
                        true and commented that even in their graves two sides would adhere to their
                        different positions, although then they would be of no danger to each
                        other.</p>
                    <p>Secretary continued he believed however there were important areas of common
                        interest to two sides, e.g., in insuring peace, something <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had spoken so eloquently in
                        connection with <gloss target="#t_TB1">TB</gloss> Treaty. Secretary then
                        expressed view both sides had unfinished tasks at home. US had such problems
                        as building more schools, creating more universities, and education more
                        teachers; also there were great urban centers in US which had been built 75
                        or 100 years ago and which required redevelopment or rebuilding,
                        particularly because of population growth. Thus US <pb n="731" xml:id="pg_731" facs="0759"/>had great deal to do for its people, and he
                        knew <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had also interests in
                        welfare of his own people. Secretary believed two sides could sit down to
                        sort out their problems and see how they could move towards peaceful world,
                        be it in small or large steps. He felt both governments were obligated to
                        their peoples do so, and as far as US was concerned it was prepared do its
                        share.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said Sovs also believed it
                        more useful engage in productive efforts, which brought joy to the living,
                        rather than in preparing graves for the living. Latter was also activity in
                        which Sovs were now engaged, but this was because of necessity and Sovs were
                        doing everything possible to halt arms race <gloss target="#t_ASAP1">ASAP</gloss>. He believed two sides must not stop at what they have
                        achieved. Sovs had listed matters they believed could be resolved next, and
                        there was no need to repeat that list. He had spoken about this publicly and
                        to <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>, and he was certain
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> had informed in detail
                        both Secretary and President.</p>
                    <p>However, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> continued, Sovs
                        believed basic problem was German problem. So long as German problem
                        remained unresolved, two sides would be like hedgehogs sticking their
                        needles into each other. German problem was such as made each side wish have
                        it resolved in its own way. He could understand very well that if US could
                        resolve German problem in its own way, i.e., by liquidating social system in
                            <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and establishing united capitalist
                        Germany that would be great victory for President, Congress, and those who
                        supported capitalism. Likewise, if <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> were
                        made part of socialist camp that would be tremendous victory for communism.
                        But all this was sheer fantasy, for it could not be achieved without war. He
                        wondered therefore whether time had not come when we, mature people who knew
                        life and had seen war, should try move things from rails of war to rails of
                        peace, namely, record situation as it existed now and forget about Adenauer
                        and other people opposing such course. It was not only US who had such
                        allies, for God had not forgotten <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        either and had given it allies who did not understand its policy. He
                        believed however all such allies would eventually realize they had been
                        wrong and unrealistic.</p>
                    <p>Secretary said US recognized German problem was fundamental and most
                        important to future of our two countries and of our associates. He said he
                        was prepared discuss this matter with representatives of Soviet Government
                        during his stay here in order to see whether some understanding possible. We
                        on our side recognize that in view past history what happened in Germany was
                        of great importance to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Likewise,
                        again for historical reasons, we too were interested greatly in having peace
                        in Central Europe. US recognized this very well as it had also been involved
                        in two World Wars. Secretary then observed two sides perhaps differed in
                        their respective interpretations as to what was happening in that area now.
                        For our part, we believed German people were prepared <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0760"/>put past behind them and become part of
                        peaceful community of nations. We also believed we must not make situation
                        such as would deprive German people of opportunity pursue this course or
                        create danger of war. He reiterated he prepared discuss these matters while
                        here. Referring to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        hedgehog simile, Secretary said he not sure who were those hedgehogs;
                        however he had impression that during past few years relaxation had occurred
                        in Central Europe. <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s increased relations
                        with countries to east in such fields as trade, commerce, and exchange of
                        persons had, in his view, reduced tensions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> interjected Secretary had
                        mentioned “countries to east” and apparently did not wish use term
                        “socialist”, but Sovs would teach us to use this term and, after all, time
                        was best teacher.</p>
                    <p>Secretary continued he had been encouraged by this trend over past few years
                        and believed possibility for peaceful settlement had now improved as
                        compared to possibility existing two or three years ago.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> agreed.</p>
                    <p>Secretary then said that as to use of term “socialist”, he had visited
                        Belgrade recently<note n="2" xml:id="d344fn2">Regarding <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s visit to Belgrade May 4-5, see
                                <ref target="frus1961-63v16">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961-1963, vol. XVI</ref>,
                            pp. 350-353.</note> and on basis that visit had gained impression there
                        was less involvement by government in economy in Yugoslavia than was in US.
                        He also noted <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had been
                        using term “incentive”, which was capitalist term.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said Sovs knew this and
                        indeed had argued some Communists about relationship between incentive
                        factor and moral factor.</p>
                    <p>Sovs believed period of transition between capitalism and communism must
                        include both capitalist factors, such as incentive, and moral factors, the
                        two overlapping each other. Sovs believed capitalist phenomena in history
                        was a positive one, as it was better than feudalism; however, Sovs believed
                        communism was highest form of human society. In fact, capitalism had given
                        birth to communism for if there had been no capitalism there would have been
                        no Marx and all we would have today in such case would be legends about
                        Christ and other utopian theories. What Sovs wished was to see efforts of
                        two sides directed at competition in economic and cultural fields; they
                        liked such competition much better than competition in rockets and nuclear
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>Secretary recalled Seaborg, Udall, Freeman had visited <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in recent months and believed there were
                        a number of points, some of them small, where greater cooperation between
                        our two countries should be possible. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> himself had been soldier, therefore knew that
                        when there was advance on broad front obstacle arising at one particular
                        sector of front should not stop advance on rest of front. Thus we should <pb n="733" xml:id="pg_733" facs="0761"/>move forward in such fields as
                        nuclear energy research, space medicine, education, and other fields where
                        US could benefit from <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could benefit from US. He hoped he could
                        explore possibilities of cooperation in details quite apart from more
                        difficult problems before our two countries, although of course he was
                        prepared to discuss more difficult questions as well.</p>
                    <p>Secretary then said he knew <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        had another appointment very shortly and suggested that since he was not
                        permitted speak on behalf of Senate, Senator Fulbright might wish to make a
                        few remarks.</p>
                    <p>Fulbright said wished first recall pleasant meeting Foreign Relations
                        Committee had had with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        four years ago, during latter's visit to US. That had been very interesting
                        meeting and committee had benefited from it greatly. Fulbright then said he
                        was very much interested in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s exchange views with Secretary. It seemed to him
                        that differences <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had been
                        talking about could perhaps be compared to differences existing between
                        North and South some 100 years ago. He himself was from South but he felt
                        differences of past had virtually disappeared and Yankees now looked quite
                        all right to him. Believed many differences between two sides were
                        exaggerated. After all, both our countries wished improve life of their
                        people, and he was impressed with what was being done in this respect in
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. As to US, we had mixed system and
                        we did many things as Sovs did. Indeed, while <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was sometimes accused of promoting capitalism in
                        his country, US Government was frequently accused of being socialist. Thus
                        he believed things our two countries try to do were not different;
                        differences lay in methods and means, because we believe our methods were
                        more effective than Soviet methods, and vice versa. Indeed these differences
                        appeared to him to be more in our minds than in our actions. Fulbright then
                        recalled that during Khrushchev's visit to Foreign Relations Committee,
                        Senator Russell had observed <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would make good US politician and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had replied <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would not have stupid man as its
                        Premier.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> remembered this exchange,
                        but noted our two countries different and indeed opposite political and
                        philosophical views. Nevertheless, he agreed that two countries had same
                        ultimate goal, namely, development of their resources for benefit of their
                        people. However, in pursuing that goal US was applying capitalist principle
                        of private property, whereas Sovs were applying principle of common
                        socialist property. While objective was same, Soviet approach was more noble
                        for Sovs were acting on broad popular basis while US was acting on
                        individualistic basis; US believed in principle of each for himself, while
                        Sovs believed in principle of everyone for all. In any event, he did not
                        think it would be possible sign agreed document on this matter now. He noted
                        however Sovs could learn a lot from US and indeed had borrowed <pb n="734" xml:id="pg_734" facs="0762"/>a lot from US experience. Lenin and Stalin
                        had also recognized that there were many interesting things in US which
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could borrow. However, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had been a student worthy of his teacher
                        as it had surpassed US in certain fields. At time of Udall's visit here,
                        latter had noted US had taught <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> how to
                        build hydroelectric power stations, but now could learn something from the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then said Sovs now wished
                        bring about radical solution of their agricultural problem, and hoped to do
                        so within seven or eight years. When Garst was here<note n="3" xml:id="d344fn3">See <ref target="#d44fn2">footnote 2, Document
                            44</ref>, and <ref target="#d341fn7">footnote 7, Document
                            341</ref>.</note> he had said that in order to have chemical fertilizers
                        it was necessary to invest a great deal of capital. But now <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had money available for this purpose and
                        intended allocate billions of rubles to development of chemical industry
                        producing such things as fertilizers, plastics, etc. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then showed sample of
                        polyethylene, saying it had been produced at a plant Sovs had brought from
                        Krupp. He said some people in US believe that by imposing arms race on
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> they would prevent it from
                        catching up with US. However this was totally erroneous, and he could give
                        his word that <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would catch up with
                        US.</p>
                    <p>In closing, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> observed he
                        leaving for Black Sea tomorrow and would be happy if Secretary could come
                        there too and take a dip in sea with him. He recalled he had swum there with
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1">McCloy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_US1">Udall</persName> and others, and he hoped Secretary
                        would also immerse himself in that baptismal font.</p>

                    <p>Pursuing general talk at lunch, Sec suggested extension of present
                        cooperation in outer space, peaceful use atoms and agriculture as fields
                        worth exploring. Cited as specific examples of possibilities: (1) joint
                        effort on super-accelerator on order 500 billion volts which might cost $400
                        to 500 million. In reply <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s
                        questions, said effort might be initially Soviet-American to be joined in
                        later by others interested and US had no fixed ideas as to location. Seaborg
                        was interested in this possibility and Soviet scientist Wechsler <note n="2" xml:id="d345fn2"> Vladimir I. Wechsler, atomic physicist and member of

                        Space medicine. (3) Exchange of information and plant materials and
                        establishment joint projects on flights affecting basic food production.
                        This was field in which US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are
                        allies against nature and cooperation might be on lines similar to projects

                        asked whether this might be defeated or pigeon-holed in house. Secy said

                        Mongolian signature on <gloss target="#t_TB1">TB</gloss> Treaty. Soviets did
                        not understand this and might have to review our position. Secy responded we
                        had thought countries would sign with depositaries they recognize, whether
                        this be one, two or all three. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said this not their understanding of talks with
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> and Hailsham and they
                        had thought no such cases would arise. With single exception Taipeh, Soviets
                        prepared accept any signature, for example, Spain, Latin American countries,
                        Portugal, Ireland. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> did not accept such

                        further discussion, during which <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he didn't know if Hanoi intended sign, Secy
                        undertook to look into question further with legal experts, but pointed out
                        might have some problems on this with Senate.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> turned to trade. Secy said we
                        had given this some thought and he would suggest we have talks on subject in
                        some detail. Matter was complicated, some aspects being executive, others
                        legislative. Leaving aside effect of political atmosphere, there were other
                        problems. First of all, US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were
                        not naturally complementary economically, so seemed doubtful any really
                        large possibilities for development. Another hampering factor was Soviet
                        trading practices, notably as re patents and copyrights. After some
                        discussion, with citation examples, Soviet publication American works
                        without permission or payment, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said this was small problem. Another aspect, Secy
                        said, is Soviet practice buying only proto-types. He had recently reviewed
                        long list showing great variety items of which one or two samples exported.
                        Would rather sell <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> thousand tractors
                        than just one. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> cited recent
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>

                        in US. Secy then referred to lend-lease saying impasse on last attempt at
                        settlement resulted from Soviet insistence linking with trade. If we get
                        into trade discussions perhaps this impasse could now be overcome. Amb
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> brought up in this
                        connection Soviet absence from NY World's Fair. In response <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> comment too late to consider, Mr.

                        timely construction if Soviet decision on participation promptly reversed.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was noncommittal, but

                    </p>
                    <p>Secy brought up Embassy's need for leased line to Western Europe, citing
                        delay in communications during <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>/Hailsham talks. Referring to Soviet Government
                        leased lines from New York, he expressed hope for reciprocity in this
                        question. In response Secy's inquiry whether this was policy question,
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied not policy but
                        rather technical involving other government agencies. Some discussion ensued
                        during which Kohler cited details on recent delays in telegram traffic and
                        expressed surprise technical problems involved since such lines previously
                        provided to press agencies and facilities understood to be available.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> indicated he would look
                        into status of matter but gave no commitment. Secy then asked whether SovGov
                        interested in establishing direct radio link from new Embassy. No direct
                        reply was given but <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> inquired
                        whether arrangements actually made with any other governments under new US
                        legislation. Secy replied a number were under discussion; he would provide
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> with full information on

                        in familiar terms. Secy said he could not understand what objection Soviets
                        have to our troops in Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        replied objection certainly not military. However, this was remnant of World
                        War II which should be eliminated. Social system of West Berlin, in which we
                        interested, would be guaranteed. Secy said we regarded US presence in West
                        Berlin as a stabilizing factor. This avoided a direct German confrontation,
                        which would be precarious. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        replied US presence not stabilizing but irritating factor. Conversation

                    <p>After some discussion of the German problem, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> suggested that it be put aside and that a more
                        innocent subject be taken up. He said he wished to discuss US/<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> trade.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> asked whether US
                        capitalists wanted to get big orders for chemical equipment. US
                        industrialists should be given opportunity to resolve this problem; the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would reach agreement with them,
                        and they wanted agreement, but Congressional laws interfered.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he had received reports from Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> about their conversations on the
                        subject with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Also, he
                        had discussed this matter with the President before leaving for Moscow. He
                        had had an informal and rather incomplete discussion of the problem with Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> while flying down

                                345</ref>.</note> There were two types of problems concerning trade.
                        Some could be resolved without Congressional action, while others required
                        such action. As far as chemical plants were concerned, he did not believe
                            <pb n="739" xml:id="pg_739" facs="0767"/>this matter required
                        legislative action, but could rather be handled by the Executive Branch. The
                        Secretary said he would look into this matter when he was back in
                        Washington.</p>
                    <p>However, the Secretary continued, he wanted to make some general observations
                        as regards trade. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had
                        said, and quite rightly, that trade meant peace and that those who traded
                        wanted peace, whereas those who did not trade did not want peace. But if one
                        looked at Soviet trade transactions with the West, one saw that it involved
                        something like 5-1/2 billion dollars a year. As to the United States, we had
                        very little trade with the Soviet Union, and he believed we must improve
                        this situation. But given the considerable difficulties on other problems,
                        such as, for example, West Berlin, the question arose among the American
                        people whether trade really went together with peace, and people wonder
                        whether considerable trade between the Soviet Union and Western Europe
                        really went hand in hand with peace. As far as he personally was concerned,
                        he believed that it was so, but he wished Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s comment on this. The Secretary reiterated that
                        we regarded trade as part of good relations and we would be glad to see
                        channels for trade between West and East develop, including with the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that trade was not a
                        matter where one party was obliging the other. No tradesman traded to oblige
                        the other fellow; he traded only when it was profitable to do so. On the
                        other hand, prohibition of trade with this or that tradesman was a matter of
                        policy, because a country having such laws was guided by unkind intentions.
                        The Soviet Union was for free trade with all countries of the world; it
                        would be good if the United States adopted the same approach and if it
                        convinced in this respect Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>, who was taking a cold war position on this matter
                        and was against US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> trade, as well as
                        against trade between the West and the socialist countries in general.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> went on that Soviet
                        specialists were not exactly keen on placing orders for chemical plants in
                        the United States, for they believed US-manufactured equipment was the most
                        expensive and they preferred to place their orders in other countries where
                        prices were more favorable. Thus the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        could place very large orders in the US only if commercial credit were
                        allowed and if prices were comparable to world market prices. This meant
                        that the Soviet Union wanted trade with the United States, but not under any
                        circumstances. If those provisos were not met, the Soviet Union would place
                        its orders elsewhere or build the equipment itself.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary reiterated he would look into the matter of chemical plants
                        upon his return to Washington. He observed in this connection that there
                        might be legislative inhibitions with regard to credit.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> interjected he was
                        speaking not of government credit but rather of commercial credit; while he
                        would welcome government <pb n="740" xml:id="pg_740" facs="0768"/>credit he
                        understood this was a difficult problem involving matters of policy. He also
                        wished to observe that as far as commercial credit was concerned the Soviet
                        Union had such credit available to it in quantities greater than it could
                        use.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary continued that as far as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> was concerned, the latter acted on instructions and
                        he, the Secretary, had seen him receive many bruises in Congress while
                        trying to liberalize trade with specialist countries. We had no deus ex
                        machina here, this question was a matter of governmental policy in which the
                        President had a great personal interest.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he wished to conclude the discussion of this subject by
                        recalling the suggestion he had made to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, namely, that at some stage he and Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> could take up details of
                        the problem in Washington and attempt to work out solutions advantageous to
                        both countries.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he welcomed this.
                        However, he wished to emphasize—and he hoped the Secretary would understand
                        this—that this matter should be handled on the basis of equality. He was not
                        pleading or holding out his hand; he was an equal partner and he would buy
                        only what he needed and only if the prices were comparable to world market
                        prices.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary observed we called this Yankee trading. In other words, both
                        sides bargained hard but both derived advantage from the transaction.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had had good trade partners in United
                        States such as Du Pont and other solid companies. Those companies were eager
                        to have trade relations resumed if only the government did not stand in the
                        way.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary acknowledged that some American companies had approached the US
                        Government in recent weeks</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> concluded the discussion
                        on trade by saying some US industrialists were displeased with US trade
                        policy. They felt, and quite rightly so, that they were losing their markets
                        to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Japan, France, and other countries
                        with which the Soviet Union had extensive trade relations.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then raised the subject of Laos, the discussion of which is
                        covered in part IV of this memorandum of conversation.</p>

                    <p rend="center">THE NEW PHASE OF SOVIET POLICY</p>
                    <p>1. After a long period of immobility and probable internal contention
                        following on the Cuban missile crisis, the Soviets have now embarked on a
                        new and active line of policy. As the Chinese Communists have pointed out
                        with great relish, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has
                        executed a “180-degree about-face” in accepting a partial ban on nuclear
                        testing.</p>
                    <p>2. As with any major turn, the present switch probably involves a number of
                        considerations, all of which point in the Soviet mind to the desirability of
                        a period of reduced tensions in East-West relations. The main factors
                        probably are Soviet internal economic problems, the sharpening conflict with
                        China, and the opportunities presented by current divisions within the
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Internal Problems</p>
                    <p>3. Present evidence suggests that an important reason for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s acceptance of a limited test
                        ban is the desire to ease the military burden on the Soviet economy so that
                        more resources can be devoted to urgent civilian programs. He has made
                        repeated attempts to press this course upon his colleagues for about four
                        years. During this same period, the economic case for some moderation of
                        military and space spending has steadily gained weight; the rate of growth
                        of <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> has slowed down, investment increases
                        have become smaller and smaller, agriculture has remained virtually
                        stagnant, and manifestations of consumer discontent have increased. Military
                        and space programs, with their heavy demands on first-quality resources and
                        on the machinery and equipment industry, have been the most important single
                        cause of these problems. Furthermore, Soviet increases in military and space
                        expenditures have thus far tended to spur US military and space programs and
                        thus to increase the prospective future burden for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. Nevertheless, last winter it appeared that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might respond to the Cuban missile crisis with a
                        reaffirmation and perhaps even a strengthening of the primacy of defense
                        over other economic sectors. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> spoke of the need constantly to replace advanced
                        weapons systems and warned that increases in consumption would have to be
                        limited by defense needs. Beginning in the spring, however, Soviet officials
                            <pb n="742" xml:id="pg_742" facs="0770"/>began to make statements which
                        suggested that important new economic decisions were being taken. By early
                        June—before the President's American University speech of the tenth<note n="2" xml:id="d347fn2">See <ref target="#d328">Document
                            328</ref>.</note> and the receipt of the Chinese letter of the
                            fourteenth<note n="3" xml:id="d347fn3">For text of this letter, see <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>, July 5,
                            1963.</note>—<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> laid down
                        guidelines for revising the 1964-65 economic plan.</p>
                    <p>5. These instructions and his subsequent elaborations point to a major shift
                        of resources into the chemical industry, and specifically into those
                        components—fertilizer and synthetics—which work for agriculture and the
                        consumer. Present indications are that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> intends to invest on the order of 15 billion rubles in
                        this effort during the next five to six years.</p>
                    <p>6. New investment in technically advanced industries, particularly the
                        chemical industry, will require the same kinds of scarce resources as those
                        needed by advanced military programs. The effort now projected is so large
                        as to point strongly toward a decision not to increase military and space
                        spending at the high rate of recent years. We cannot determine, however, how
                        much the growth of military and space expenditures will be checked, or
                        whether the Soviets contemplate actual reductions. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may have decided, for example,
                        to resume the cutting of conventional forces, to abstain from competing with
                        the US in a manned lunar landing race, or to set force goals for advanced
                        weapon programs lower than those previously contemplated. Such decisions
                        would presumably hinge on an easing of cold war tensions which would reduce
                        risks to a minimum and hopefully result also in a slowing down of Western
                        military programs. And on the internal scene, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wishes to be able to point to an improved
                        international atmosphere in order to forestall objections that his shift of
                        resources endangers Soviet security.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Conflict With Peiping</p>
                    <p>7. Whatever his internal concerns, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could not have decided for a test ban without
                        assessing the consequences for the dispute with China. Since the Soviets
                        knew that an all-out Chinese attack on a test-ban pact was inevitable, the
                        decision to sign the agreement was at the same time a decision to force the
                        issue with China and thereby to assert in the strongest terms their
                        intention to determine Communist policy. Furthermore, a nuclear test ban is
                        excellently suited to the polemics over nuclear war which the Soviets have
                        chosen as their strongest ground. Thus the Soviets not only gain something
                        they can represent as a tangible success for the general political line
                        attacked by China, but they force the Chinese to appear truculent and
                        irresponsible in the sight of <pb n="743" xml:id="pg_743" facs="0771"/>those
                        underdeveloped countries and foreign Communists which are the objects of
                        Sino-Soviet rivalry.</p>
                    <p>8. Aside from these considerations, the Soviet agreement to a partial test
                        ban is one more proof that Moscow assesses Sino-Soviet relations as entirely
                        beyond repair unless and until Peiping makes a fundamental reversal of its
                        course. This does not mean, however, that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will acknowledge any common interest with the
                        West against China, lest this be taken as a sign of weakness which would
                        embolden the West to take a firmer stand against his demands in other
                        fields.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Policy Toward the West</p>
                    <p>9. Apart from these concerns of domestic development and bloc rivalry, the
                        Soviets are also moving to exploit the opportunities of the present moment
                        in the Western camp. Divisions have been widening between France and the
                        Anglo-Saxon powers, and Adenauer's imminent departure has opened new
                        prospects in Germany. The agreement on nuclear testing is particularly
                        appropriate as the initial move in a more active European diplomacy; not
                        only does it engage the sensitive and unresolved issue of nuclear policy in
                        the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance, but it also opens all
                        the Western differences related to questions of European security.</p>
                    <p>10. This development in the Western alliance comes at a time when the Soviets
                        are keenly aware, in the wake of the Cuban missile crisis, that a renewal of
                        pressure tactics offers little promise for immediate gains and probably
                        higher risks than ever before. On grounds of both prudence and opportunity,
                        therefore, the tactics of detente, neglected since the Camp David period,
                        probably seem indicated.</p>
                    <p>11. The primary objective of present Soviet tactics in Europe is, as always,
                        Germany. Here the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> wishes not only to
                        stabilize the position of East Germany (and, by extension, of Eastern
                        Europe) but to destabilize the situation in West Germany by persuading Bonn
                        that its present allies have forsaken their commitment to uphold the goal of
                        reunification. Thus nearly all the Soviet proposals for the “next”
                        agreements after a test ban are designed to extract Western acceptance of
                        the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>12. The non-aggression pact clearly pursues this aim, as does the proposal
                        for limits on foreign forces in East and West Germany. The offer of an
                        exchange of military missions between Soviet and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces in the two Germanies works in the same direction;
                        these missions already exist, and the Soviet proposal is merely designed to
                        put them on a new basis which will extinguish their connection with the
                        postwar occupation agreements based on the concept of eventual
                        reunification. The Soviets have not yet spelled out details of their
                        suggestion for control posts to inhibit surprise attack, but when they do it
                        is very likely that the two <pb n="744" xml:id="pg_744" facs="0772"/>Germanies will be included in the scheme as another means of freezing the
                        present division.</p>
                    <p>13. The more recognition the Soviets can obtain for this division, the more
                        success they would expect in their campaign to draw West Germany away from
                        its close connections to the West. The inducements of trade are to be the
                        main incentive in this effort, and Soviet propagandists are now laboring to
                        impart a magic to the word “Rapallo.” <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is probably encouraged by evidences of West
                        German industry's desire for Eastern markets, by Bonn's moves to establish
                        trade missions in Eastern Europe, and by the coming withdrawal of Adenauer.
                        His constant complaints against the restrictive US attitude toward trade
                        with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> reflect, we believe, not so
                        much a desire for greater exchanges with the Americans but rather an effort
                        to break down the network of Western restraints which reinforce Bonn's
                        hitherto negative attitude.</p>
                    <p>14. An additional factor in Soviet calculations is nuclear proliferation,
                        which to Moscow means primarily the danger of a West German atomic
                        capability. It seems certain that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        does not expect the partial test ban, or even a comprehensive one, to deter
                        either France or Communist China from becoming a nuclear power. But it
                        probably does see the present agreement, and the hopes for detente which it
                        is meant to generate, as raising further obstacles against the various ways
                        by which the Germans might move toward a nuclear capability—an independent
                        effort, cooperation with the French, or participation in a multilateral
                        force.</p>
                    <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> must calculate that,
                        even if he cannot make tangible advances toward these objectives, he can in
                        the very process lay substantial strains on relations within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Broadly speaking, he can continually
                        pose to Germany's allies an apparent choice between accommodating West
                        Germany's concerns at the expense of detente or sacrificing these concerns
                        to the prospect of a permanent stabilization of Europe and a thawing of the
                        cold war. In this way he expects, at a minimum, to fray US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> patience with Germany and to generate new
                        doubts in the Federal Republic.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Tactics in the Present Phase</p>
                    <p>16. For the present, then, Soviet policy seeks to sustain an atmosphere of
                        relaxed tensions in East-West relations. In the process, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will propose a variety of limited
                        agreements, probably involving tactical variations on previous Soviet
                        positions. But <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wishes to
                        focus the negotiating process primarily on Europe, and even here he probably
                        does not contemplate significant Soviet concessions to Western views.</p>
                    <p>17. At Geneva, he will probably concentrate on partial disarmament plans and
                        declaratory agreements of the type which he has recently set forth, but he
                        will also employ East-West forums to try to bring such issues <pb n="745" xml:id="pg_745" facs="0773"/>as the non-aggression pact to fruition. We
                        expect him at some point to make a direct overture to <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>'s successor. Throughout, he will
                        play upon the fears that Western refusal to grant concessions will endanger
                        the mood of détente. And since his tactics depend greatly on precisely this
                        mood, he will probably find an early occasion to propose a summit meeting,
                        calculating that he could put the resulting Chinese outcry to use in his
                        campaign to isolate Peiping.</p>
                    <p>18. It is too early, however, to predict with confidence whether the Soviets
                        would be willing at some point to pay any important price to deepen and
                        prolong the new phase which they have set in motion. The preceding analysis
                        indicates no reduction of their aspirations in regard to Germany, but rather
                        an intention to pursue them in a different way. They have recently restated
                        their aims to consolidate the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>'s position
                        in full equality with the Federal Republic and to terminate the special
                        Western position in Berlin in favor of a neutralized city. If asked to make
                        concessions, such as new guarantees for Berlin, in order to sustain detente,
                        we think that they would probably refuse.</p>
                    <p>19. If the German question proves as intractable as ever, the Soviets could
                        terminate the present phase; indeed, <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> has recently taken pains to remind the West of its
                        vulnerability to harassments in Berlin and on the access routes. We think it
                        more likely, however, that the Soviets will maneuver to avoid a clear-cut
                        early stalemate. Balked in one field, they would probably seek some other
                        area of discussion to sustain the atmosphere of relaxation. They might, for
                        example, move to develop some new perspective in the disarmament field,
                        perhaps by conveying a readiness to take up <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s proposal to be host for a new conference. In this
                        connection, it is worth noting that China has reacted to the nuclear
                        test-ban agreement by taking over the Soviet position as an exponent of
                        radical disarmament, a development which may help to keep Soviet disarmament
                        policy focused on limited measures.</p>
                    <p>20. Our view that the Soviets intend to sustain a period of relaxed tensions
                        even in the absence of tangible agreements rests to a great extent upon our
                        belief that Khrushchev has been required by the exigencies of his present
                        situation to create a more amiable relationship with the West. To this
                        extent, he is inhibited from reverting to high-risk policies or even to more
                        menacing atmospherics. We believe that his economic policies and his
                        decision to meet Peiping head-on give him a vested interest in perpetuating
                        for some time the impression that a new era in East-West relations has
                        begun. Some support for this view can be derived from Soviet treatment of
                        the non-aggression pact; whereas <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> evidently worked hard to secure a commitment on this
                        from the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> negotiators, subsequent
                        Soviet propaganda has listed it as the most desirable next step but has not
                        implied that detente would collapse without it. It would be characteristic
                        of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to enter upon a new
                        phase of policy <pb n="746" xml:id="pg_746" facs="0774"/>with great optimism
                        but without any clear idea of how much tangible success was necessary to
                        justify continuing the new line. It would also be characteristic of him to
                        scale down his expectations only when repeatedly thwarted.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Some Contingencies</p>
                    <p>21. Western response to the ongoing détente campaign will therefore have an
                        important bearing on how far <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is prepared to go. Though he is advancing old
                        proposals, there will be a special incentive in the West to review them
                        again because of the prospects opened up by the Sino-Soviet rift and the
                        Soviet acceptance, without a concurrent and tangible quid pro quo, of
                        Western terms for a partial test ban. On the other hand, Franco-German
                        suspicions of Soviet intentions are already evident and are likely to be
                        aggravated as <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> presses
                        proposals related to the division of Germany. If, at a later date, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> judges that his détente tactics
                        have brought about a significant weakening of Western cohesion, but no
                        actual concessions, he might think that some renewal of Berlin pressures
                        would help him to cash in.</p>
                    <p>22. Outside the framework of European relations, there are two situations
                        which could intrude on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        calculations: Cuba and China. The more conciliatory line toward the US
                        brings general Soviet policy into line with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s efforts to damp down the Cuban situation in
                        order to consolidate <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>'s
                        position. Agreement on this tactic was evidently one result of the <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> discussions. But <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> is a third party to any East-West understanding, and
                        he is capable of affecting it by his own independent actions. His 26 July
                        speech, for example, constitutes a reservation of sorts on the extension of
                        any Soviet-US negotiations to Cuba and Latin America, and in general the
                        intensity of US-Cuban antagonisms makes unlikely any substantial and
                        prolonged easing of tensions. Similarly, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> must fear that the US, even if it cooperates in
                        cultivating a general debate, will exclude Cuba from this sphere and perhaps
                        take some new vigorous action against it. If Cuba and the US become involved
                        in rising tensions and new clashes, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will be under great pressure to support <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> at the expense of his détente tactics
                        with the US.</p>
                    <p>23. The Chinese, of course, are violently opposed to the new turn in Soviet
                        policy. In a number of ways—an aggressive move in Laos, for example, or a
                        new attack on India—the Chinese could demonstrate the limits of any
                        international understanding reached without their participation. It is
                        possible that the Chinese would generate in the international Communist
                        movement enough disillusionment with Soviet policy to force <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> into demonstrations of militancy
                        and revolutionary zeal which would undercut his present line. We think this
                        unlikely, however, because <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        appears to have taken a definite <pb n="747" xml:id="pg_747" facs="0775"/>decision to contest these criticisms verbally without altering his own
                        policies.</p>
                    <p>24. A further contingency relates to internal Soviet politics. In our view,
                        Soviet domestic and foreign policy have been more deeply intertwined in the
                        months since Cuba than in any other period since <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> attained power.</p>
                    <p>25. Events of the past six months suggest the existence of a conservative
                        sentiment among some Soviet leaders who would have opted for a different
                        line on economic questions and relations with the West or at least worked to
                        oppose or dilute the line which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is now espousing. Not only the allocation of
                        resources, but questions of cultural policy, the extent of de-Stalinization,
                        economic administration, and perhaps even relations with Yugoslavia appear
                        to have been at issue in the presidium last winter. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has told several Westerners that
                        he had great difficulty in obtaining Kremlin agreement on his December offer
                        of two or three on-site inspections for a comprehensive test ban, and
                        implied that he had encountered reproaches when the US insisted on more.
                        Since the incapacitation in April of <persName corresp="#p_KFR1">Kozlov</persName>, who we suspect was a key figure among the
                        conservatives, Soviet policy on all these issues has increasingly reflected
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s preferences. At any
                        rate, in the aftermath of the Cuban crisis <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s policies seem to have been stymied, and this
                        could have implications for the durability of the present phase of Soviet
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>26. By this we do not mean that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> can be regarded as “soft” and his colleagues as
                        “hard”; we continue to believe that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> probably was the main proponent of the Cuban
                        missile deployment. What the evidence suggests is that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has a more flexible outlook and
                        a greater concern to keep Soviet policy in motion over a wide tactical
                        range, while some (not all) of his colleagues incline more consistently
                        toward internal discipline, heavy military spending, and a stance of greater
                        hostility toward the West. If this is so, it means that some future
                        development in the political leadership could undermine the current line of
                        Soviet foreign policy, especially if it fails to deliver the benefits
                        anticipated. In any case, following <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s departure there may be intense debate over
                        these matters.</p>

                        is no question but that Soviets went all out to handle my visit in a
                        friendly and relaxed fashion. This was true not only of highest officials
                        but of all levels including such a sourpuss as Zorin. Senators and other
                        members our party given same treatment.</p>
                    <p>At the Black Sea <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was very
                        much the affable grandfather. Although he said the usual things about Berlin
                        there was no bluster or threat. One could not detect any sign of impending
                        actions against the West but this could of course change overnight without
                        notice. My chief impression of the talk with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, with which <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>
                        agree, was that other matters, possibly not fully known to us, are much more
                        on his mind than are issues with the West. Both he and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> referred to continuing the talks
                        when <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> comes to the United
                        Nations in September and expressed the hope that by that time an additional
                        point or two of agreement could be found.</p>
                    <p>In a private talk with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> I
                        pressed him hard on Cuba and even on that subject he did not bristle. He
                        said, “I want to tell you most seriously, and I am speaking officially, that
                        the Soviet Union now has in Cuba only a limited number of military personnel
                        engaged in training of Cubans. There is not in Cuba a Soviet military unit
                        of any type, not even a platoon. Please inform the President of this.” When
                        I pressed him further on <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>'s
                        activities in Latin America he said that <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> was merely engaging in public debate and that it is
                        words not action. I told him we were concerned about <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>'s activities; he feigned surprise and
                        said he would be interested if I were to inform him of any such activities
                        we have in mind. Neither he nor <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> raised overflights or any other menaces which
                        preceded earlier discussion of my visit to Moscow.</p>

                    <p>From 5:50 to 6:25 p.m. on August 15, 1963, Ambassador at Large <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Llewellyn Thompson</persName> met with President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> in the Oval Office for a
                        discussion of U.S.-Soviet relations. <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> reported on talks with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, Soviet Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, and other Soviet
                        officials during his visit to Moscow as a member of the U.S. delegation to
                        the signing ceremony for the Limited Test Ban Treaty. The conversation
                        ranged over many topics in addition to the treaty: the Sino-Soviet split,
                        the Soviet economy, Laos, Berlin, the Bonn government, Cuba, Brazil, the
                        non-aggression pact, the U.S.-Soviet air agreement, and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> himself. A tape recording of the
                        conversation is in the Kennedy Library, President's Office Files,
                        Presidential Recordings, Tape 106/A41.</p>
                    <p>“One of the things he [<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>] hit
                        hardest was trade,” <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>
                        reported, and “he made clear he wanted [commercial] credits.” Asked by
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, “if they have all this legendary store of
                        gold, what advantage are the credits to them?” <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> replied “we think they have a real balance of
                        payments problem—the whole bloc.” <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> continued, “we don't know what their gold stocks
                        are but we don't think they're all that big and they've been drawing down on
                        them undoubtedly. And now you see the earlier credits they've had from our
                        European allies are coming due as they begin to pay for this stuff. And
                        they're trying to stretch out now in their talks with the Japanese and
                        others to get longer credits than they've been getting. So I think they are
                        hurting.”</p>
                    <p>Questioned by <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> about the civil air agreement with
                        the Soviets, <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> reported that
                        Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, who headed
                        the U.S. delegation to Moscow, told the Soviets that “one practical problem
                        is that PanAm didn't want to start the service in the winter time, they'd
                        lose money.” <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> agreed to “look
                        into” a proposal to “sign it in the fall and have it take effect in the
                        spring.” During a brief discussion of the Sino-Soviet split, <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said “there's no chance of their
                        getting together, in my opinion, between the two countries. I think there is
                        a chance that, as they both slip down this road they're going, they may want
                        to avoid forcing these parties [Communist parties in other countries] to
                        choose up and take sides.”</p>
                    <p>The President asked <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> why he
                        thought the Soviets accepted the Limited Test Ban Treaty. <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> responded at some length,
                        commenting, “I think this was in our mutual interests and they realized it.”
                        However, “they were under the illusion they could get a general ban without
                        inspection, and it took a long time. They were misled by some of [Arthur]
                        Dean's talk, and probably didn't come to this as early as they would have if
                        they hadn't thought they could get the other. And then of course we know
                        about those craters where they apparently had some explosions. <pb n="750" xml:id="pg_750" facs="0778"/>And it may be that that convinced their
                        military they could get something useful out of underground without too much
                        cost.” <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> concluded, “I
                        certainly don't think this indicates a great big turning to the West in a
                        big way,” and “if we do go ahead now it's going to be small steps.” Later in
                        the conversation, the President asked “what do you think of the chances of
                        this treaty blowing up in our face in the next year or so?” <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> replied “very slim.”</p>
                    <p>Asked whether he thought <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s “going to Russia
                        sometime” would be “worthwhile,” <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said, “yes, of course he raised that you know,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, that you come over
                        and sign an agreement.” But it “should be a meaningful agreement,” <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> continued. “I think if you got an
                        agreement on observation posts, this would be very important,” but the
                        Soviets had made it pretty clear this would be “inspection without
                        disarmament, you had to have some disarmament with it, and the things they
                        propose are not acceptable to us.”</p>
                    <p>Concerning Berlin, <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> remarked
                        on the Soviets' “mentioning what <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> called practical considerations on Berlin. There are
                        about six of them—we ought to pay for every use of the autobahn, we ought to
                        pay for use of the cables, and this business about misuse of air routes.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> thought “their purpose
                        in raising this was chiefly to push us on doing something about it.” On
                        Cuba, <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> noted that “there's
                        some talk that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might go to
                        Cuba.” That would be “helpful,” replied <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                        sarcastically. The President commented that “they've got so many promising
                        things ahead of them in Latin America, I would think they're pushing, I
                        mean, they don't have to keep any troops in Cuba.”</p>
                    <p>Near the close of the conversation, Thompson offered some observations on
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>: “I think there are
                        two things about <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, the more
                        and more I've watched him. The main thing about him is his interest in
                        production and economics. This comes out in every way. When they talk about
                        ideology, he keeps making them talk about ideologies in support of
                        production. That's what it's for. And the other thing is the German thing.
                        He's really stuck with this.” <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> continued, “almost every move he makes is related
                        to one of these two things. He's utterly convinced he can beat us
                        [unintelligible] production,” and “he certainly doesn't want to put all his
                        money down the drain for arms that he doesn't have any need for.” <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> commented further that “every
                        time he gets strong enough to do it he keeps coming back to this
                        business—surface navies are no good anymore, mass armies are outmoded, it's
                        all missiles now”; and “I think he'll reduce his troops.”</p>

                    <p>The Soviet Ambassador handed the President a letter from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d350fn2">For
                            text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v06">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961-1963, vol. VI</ref>,
                            pp. 304-305.</note> After reading it, the President said he agreed that
                        the test ban was a useful first step.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the
                        debate over the Treaty in the Senate sounded as though it were more a step
                        toward war than toward peace.</p>
                    <p>The President explained that there were, of course, some attacks on the
                        Treaty and that it was necessary to show that it was not disadvantageous to
                        us.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he had spent
                        considerable time in the United States and understood the situation. He said
                        that the Chairman hoped that we could proceed to find other areas of
                        agreement, both with respect to bilateral questions as well as in the field
                        of international affairs involving other countries. The Chairman thought it
                        would be useful to continue the exchange of opinions on these questions.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed his agreement, although he pointed out it was
                        probably better not to attempt to do anything until the Test Ban Treaty had
                        been ratified, which he thought would be the middle of September. He pointed
                        out that we understood Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        was coming to the United States and we would be glad to discuss matters with
                        him. He mentioned problems in the field of surprise attack as one possible
                        area of agreement. Another was the ban on weapons of mass destruction in
                        outer space. There was also the Civil Aviation Agreement, and we were
                        looking to see what could be done in the field of trade. He asked what other
                        questions the Soviets might have in mind.</p>
                    <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752" facs="0780"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said there was, of course,
                        the German question. He understood that talks on this problem might be
                        continued during the General Assembly.</p>
                    <p>The President remarked that the Germans were not particularly happy with us
                        just now and said he supposed we had more trouble with our allies than the
                        Soviets did with theirs. He referred to the fact that Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> would be leaving soon and that
                        there would be a new German Government to deal with. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said there was probably not much
                        point in arguing about whose allies gave the most trouble, but he asked if
                        we thought <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> was really going
                        to leave.</p>
                    <p>The President said he probably would, but it appeared that he would continue
                        to be active, and this might make matters difficult for Erhard. Then there
                        were Strauss <note n="3" xml:id="d350fn3"> Franz Josef Strauss, former West
                            German Minister of Defense.</note> and Brentano, who appeared to be
                        anxious to get back into the picture. Altogether, it was a mixed situation
                        which made the problem more complicated. He asked <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s view as to what could be done
                        about Germany now.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said everyone seemed to
                        agree that borders could not be changed by war, but the problem was how to
                        fix this situation legally. The Soviets had thought that a peace treaty was
                        the best way. No one knew what would happen in the next five or ten years.
                        The Soviets had hoped that their proposal for a nonaggression pact would be
                        accepted, and were surprised that some of the Western Powers appeared to be
                        reluctant. He said no one would gain from such an agreement, but it would
                        improve the atmosphere. He understood the point respecting implied
                        recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, but said that the
                        Soviets were prepared to take any form that was mutually acceptable to avoid
                        the recognition problem. He inquired whether the President thought an
                        agreement could be reached on this question.</p>
                    <p>The President pointed out that the French had declared themselves as opposed,
                        and that the Germans did not appear too happy about it. He thought that any
                        good will which his visit to Germany<note n="4" xml:id="d350fn4">For
                            documentation on the President's visit to Germany and Berlin, June

                        arose in connection with the Test Ban Treaty. He said, however, we had
                        agreed to explore this question and would do so. He said we would be
                        prepared to discuss it after the ratification of the Test Ban Treaty. He
                        pointed out that in addition to France and Germany, Italy seemed somewhat
                        concerned because they seemed to feel that a greater danger than the German
                        question was the support the Soviet Union gave the Communist Party in
                        Italy.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked if it were really
                        thought that such support had been increased recently.</p>
                    <pb n="753" xml:id="pg_753" facs="0781"/>
                    <p>The President did not reply directly, but said he was merely pointing out
                        what some of our problems were. He thought it was to everyone's interest
                        that West Germany and the United States maintain their present ties. There
                        were, of course, charges that Germany had a veto on United States policy,
                        but this was not really true. When <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> came to the United States, we would be prepared to
                        give an evaluation of where we stood on the nonaggression arrangement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then said there was a
                        question of observation posts, and the President mentioned weapons in outer
                        space.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked what about reduction
                        of troops? He replied in the affirmative to the President's question whether
                        he had in mind a reduction by a certain percentage.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that we actually have a de facto situation in which the
                        number of troops are at least stable. We weren't adding any, and he thought
                        the British and Belgians might withdraw some. The troop numbers were at
                        least as high as they were going to be. He pointed out that the pressures
                        from such things as our balance-of-payments were in the direction of
                        reduction and he assumed the same was true of the Soviets. We would have to
                        consider whether or not this de facto freeze was not better than attempting
                        to formalize it, which would bring in a number of complications, including
                        inspection.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he understood this
                        point, but had hoped that the question of observation posts and perhaps
                        military missions might have been combined with troop reduction. The
                        military missions could do something to verify withdrawals.</p>
                    <p>The President said we would like to reduce the numbers of our troops and
                        would look into it, but said we have to work with the Europeans, and he
                        indicated that formalizing an agreement on this subject might bring more
                        complexities than progress. With reference to our Allies, the President
                        pointed out that the Soviets were not Anglo-Saxons.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that when <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> was in Moscow, he had mentioned an
                        exchange of letters between the President and General <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. He asked whether the President
                        thought the French would continue tests.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that he thought that for the next year or so the French
                        would only test underground. He said he had written to General <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De Gaulle</persName> to see if there was some way he
                        could assist him in being able to subscribe to the Test Ban. The General had
                        replied that he thought any assistance we could give would only be under
                        limitations that were unacceptable to him. The President expressed the
                        opinion he did not think General <persName corresp="#p_dGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> wanted assistance. He then asked <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> what China would do about
                        testing.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he did not know, but
                        that the Soviets were not worried. He said how many bombs could the Chinese
                        acquire?</p>
                    <pb n="754" xml:id="pg_754" facs="0782"/>
                    <p>The President pointed out that they would not need many, and thought their
                        position would be somewhat like that of the French.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> admitted that the Chinese
                        felt entitled to have some bombs of their own, but that this would not
                        affect the balance of power. He thought that when they had acquired some
                        bombs and saw the effects of them, they would be more cautious.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that the Soviets appeared to be worried about the
                        Germans five or ten years from now and said that we had to think about the
                        Chinese over a similar period of time.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said the Soviets were not
                        worried about the Germans as such, but the possibilities they had of
                        involving the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in
                        conflict.</p>
                    <p>The President said we were not prepared to let the Germans carry us into an
                        adventure which we would have to finish, but he again made the comparison
                        with the situation with respect to China.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said the Soviets did not
                        think the Chinese wanted war, and hoped that they understood what modern war
                        was. When the President asked why the Soviets were more worried about
                        Germany than China, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> inquired
                        where the Chinese might cause trouble. When the President mentioned Laos,
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> observed that he had
                        been speaking of war, and said that Laos was in a different category.</p>
                    <p>When the President said that suppose things got worse in Laos and that <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> felt compelled to secure the Mekong
                        River and then the Chinese felt that Western troops were too close to their
                        boundary and took some action and in reply the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> powers moved against the infrastructure, this could build
                        up into something quite serious. With respect to Germany, he thought the
                        most likely danger would be some internal uprising in East Germany.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> pointed out that we already
                        have small incidents which could develop into more serious ones. He pointed
                        out how the confrontation between Soviet and American tanks in Berlin had
                        built up. He said that he was at a meeting of the leadership in Moscow when
                        the dangers in this situation were brought to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s attention. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had ordered the Soviet tanks to withdraw for some
                        distance, and said he was sure that the Americans would follow suit. This is
                        what, in fact, did happen. He said that Bonn thought that they could reunite
                        Germany, but that this was now impossible because of the different social
                        systems that had been established in the two parts of Germany.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the situation does not seem too bad. Of course,
                        Erhard would probably have to try to prove that he was as strong as
                            <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> thought that it would be
                        useful for the borders to be recognized.</p>
                    <pb n="755" xml:id="pg_755" facs="0783"/>
                    <p>The President observed that West Germany had declared it would not use force
                        to change existing borders, and thought that this was about as good as we
                        could do right now. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        expressed the opinion that we should take some further step.</p>
                    <p>The President then returned to the subject of Laos. He sometimes wished that
                        none of us had gotten in there. We wanted to keep <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> in power rather than have
                        either Phoumi or the Pathet Lao take over. He inquired whether the Soviets
                        could not do something about this.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said the Soviet position was
                        well known. The Geneva Agreement had set up <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> and a coalition government had been
                        established. The Soviets did not want to interfere, and they had no troops
                        there and did not intend to send any. In these circumstances, what could
                        they do?</p>
                    <p>The President pointed out that they had influence in various places. He
                        pointed out that the Polish member of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> had not been very helpful in getting the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to function usefully.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that we seem to
                        misunderstand their relationship with their allies, and that they did not
                        advise the Pole what to do. The President said that doubtless the Pole was
                        doing what he thought the Soviets wanted him to do.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then pointed out that
                        apparently we had a somewhat different appraisal of what was actually
                        happening on the spot in Laos. The President said he was supporting
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> and he was
                        somewhat concerned that <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna</persName>
                        might give up and go to Paris. This seemed to be where most of the political
                        figures from this part of the world ended up. In this event, we would then
                        have no central buffer between the two extremes.</p>
                    <p>The President then referred to Cuba, and said that apparently the Soviets had
                        withdrawn many of their troops, but we did not know how many were there
                        now.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had recently stated that all
                        combat units had been withdrawn from Cuba. The President asked what would
                        happen over the next six months with the Soviets. Would the Soviets withdraw
                        more or would the number remain the same?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he had no
                        instructions to say anything on this point, but his strong impression was
                        that when the Soviet instructors there had finished their jobs, they would
                        leave.</p>
                    <p>The President said we had had reports that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might go to Cuba, and asked if <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had any information on this.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said it was <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s intention to go to Cuba toward
                        the end of the year, but that no exact date had been set. He inquired
                        whether the President intended to go to the United Nations General Assembly
                        and make a speech there.</p>
                    <pb n="756" xml:id="pg_756" facs="0784"/>
                    <p>The President said that he was considering the matter, but his inclination
                        was not to go. If he went, it would be only for a day. The President said if
                        there were any change in his plan, he would let the Ambassador know.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> definitely did not plan to go to
                        the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, although there had been
                        some thought that he might appear in connection with his trip to Cuba.</p>
                    <p>The President said he was sure Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was aware of the sensitivities involved in his
                        visiting Cuba. This was Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s affair, but he wanted him to know of these
                        sensitivities.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he thought the Chairman
                        was aware of the situation but he would inform him of the President's
                        remarks. The President said that if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> came to Washington in connection with his visit to
                        the General Assembly, he would be glad to see him.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then raised the subject of
                        trade, which the President had mentioned, and said that while he had not
                        been instructed to take it up with the President, he could mention one
                        recent development. The Soviets had sold about two million dollars worth of
                        textiles to United States firms, but this sale was now blocked, he assumed
                        by the Treasury, on the grounds that the United States was not sure whether
                        these textiles were Chinese or not. He thought this was a strange
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>The President said that perhaps Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> could look into this matter.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then reverted to the
                        question of the Civil Air Agreement.</p>
                    <p>The President said this was a question of finding the right time.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that perhaps it could
                        be signed to take effect at a later date. When the President mentioned that
                        the Soviets had a considerable amount of gold and that perhaps they could
                        send us some, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the
                        Soviet proposals on troops reduction and freezing military budgets could
                        help us in this respect.</p>
                    <p>The President then raised the question of activities in outer space, pointing
                        out that these are very expensive. If outer space was not to be used for
                        military purposes, then it became largely a question of scientific prestige,
                        and even this was not very important, as accomplishments in this field were
                        usually only three-day wonders. If each of us continued on a crash program
                        as the United States was doing now, it would cost a great deal of money. He
                        wondered whether there could be any understanding about what our schedules
                        in this field were.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he thought this was
                        something that might be worked out. When the President referred to possible
                        cooperative projects, including going to the moon, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that this was an interesting
                        thought, and he would inform the Chairman. He knew from some remarks <pb n="757" xml:id="pg_757" facs="0785"/>that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had recently made that he felt that we should
                        have more cooperation in outer space.</p>
                    <p>The President said that if each knew the other's ambitions and plans, it
                        might be easier to avoid all-out competition. If Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> thought that a cooperative
                        effort was possible, he would be interested.</p>
                    <p>The interview ended with an agreement on what would be said to the press
                        about the meeting.<note n="5" xml:id="d350fn5">On August 23 <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had asked <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> to lunch and developed these

                    <p>The President called me [<persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>] to
                        ask my view as to the purpose of the <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> visit.<note n="2" xml:id="d351fn2">See <ref target="#d350">Document 350</ref>.</note> I said they appeared to be
                        looking for an agreement on most anything. He asked if the purpose might be
                        to cause us trouble with our Allies. I said that this was probably a factor
                        but did not appear to be a major one since they appear to be backing away
                        from the nonaggression pact as being an absolute requirement as the next
                        step. It appeared to me they would be happy with an agreement on Civil
                        Aviation and probably ban on weapons in outer space.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired whether we should inform the Germans, and I said I had
                        already had a request from von Lilienfeld <note n="3" xml:id="d351fn3">
                            Georg von Lilienfeld, West German Minister in the United States.</note>
                        for an appointment, and he came in at 3:00 p.m. I gave him a brief run-down,
                        saying there was nothing new, it had merely been a repetition of old
                        positions.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether we should give them a copy of the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> letter, and I suggested that
                        this not be done.</p>
                    <p>The President called attention to the story in this evening's Star which
                        states that the President will meet with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> when he arrives to attend the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>.

                        I should fill in the <gloss target="#t_P1">P</gloss>area as to what really
                        happened, that is that the President stated if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> came to Washington, the President would be glad to

                        and I have discussed possibility quick informal visit to Leningrad and have
                        consulted Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>. Our
                        judgment is that it would be inadvisable and would throw negative shadow
                        over expected successful visits to Scandinavian countries. We estimate
                        Soviets would react adversely to short visit by such high personage which
                        could not include proper visit to Moscow, suitable hospitality, and talks
                        with highest Soviet leaders. They would want such visit to be main event
                        rather than appendage to others. Second reason is that we are now in
                        sensitive period of relations with allies, especially Germans and French,
                        who would react publicly with suspicion about such a visit in context our

                    <p>In a meeting with Ambassador at Large <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> on September 10, 1963, Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> indicated that he had a personal
                        message for President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> from
                        Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stated that “the Soviet Government
                        considered that things had recently taken a turn for the better in the
                        international situation and in relations between the Soviet Union and the
                        United States. With the signing of the Test Ban Treaty and the exchange of
                        views with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, there had
                        developed a relaxation of tension and the prerequisite for the settlement of
                        other questions had been established. This could lead to a real turning <pb n="759" xml:id="pg_759" facs="0787"/>point, and the end of the cold
                        war.” <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then noted “certain
                        facts which did not fit in with the situation and these were the provocative
                        actions against Cuba, which had increased in recent weeks. Unknown planes
                        had shelled industrial establishments and there had been landings of
                        saboteurs on the Cuban coast.” The United States had stated that it “had
                        nothing to do with these actions, but no one could believe this.” If such
                        attacks continued, it “could only lead to a new crisis.” The Soviet Union
                        had “undertaken certain commitments in respect to the protection of the
                        independence of Cuba” and “would certainly fulfill its commitments if
                        aggression were unleashed against Cuba.” For text of the memorandum of

                    <p>On September 13 <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> met again
                        with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and made an oral
                        statement in which President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                        stated categorically that “not only was the United States not involved in
                        any way in such attacks, but has been making every effort to prevent them,”
                        in keeping with its policy concerning hit and run attacks by Cuban exile
                        groups. The statement then cited evidence of “Cuba's deliberate stimulation
                        and support of subversive activities throughout the Hemisphere” and
                        concluded that it was “not the United States, but the behavior of the Castro
                        regime that is to blame for the difficulties in the Caribbean area.” For

                        to inform him of my departure tomorrow for Washington, to inquire as to his

                        for continuation talks with ourselves and British. I also sought to draw
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> out on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> subjects bound to come up, such as outer

                    <p>In talk lasting more than hour <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        was affable, relaxed and quite positive in his expression of hopes of
                        progress. He will depart Moscow early Sunday morning arriving NY about 6:30
                        p.m. local time. Although he had no specific suggestions on schedule of
                        talks I gained impression he is anxious to begin discussions as soon as
                        possible and carry them on so long as they offer some hope of progress. Date
                        of return is open. In what impressed me as considered expression of official
                        Soviet view, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> as I left said
                        that as result Test-Ban Treaty, situation offers real chance for progress
                        and he hoped that we would take maximum advantage of opportunity. In his
                        view, if forthcoming round of talks could produce good results, this would
                        be good for the US, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and generally
                        for the world.</p>
                    <p>I began substantive discussion by bringing up <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> subjects. I indicated that while we had hoped progress might
                        be made in formulating outer space rules, we had been somewhat disappointed
                        to note a recent article by Korovin (<gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 812)<note n="2" xml:id="d354fn2">Telegram 812, September
                            6, summarized a letter to the editor of International Affairs by Yevgeni

                        which seemed to reflect a rejection of our suggested step-by-step approach.
                        While only vaguely familiar with article <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> pointed out that Korovin does not occupy official
                        govt position and therefore cannot express official Sov views. On other hand
                        ideas expressed by Korovin, as leading <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>
                        scientist, must be regarded as reasonable. The SovGovt view remains
                        substantially same as before: i.e. any formulation of outer space rules must
                        provide for prohibition of satellites for spying, propaganda or military
                        purposes. Within this general framework, <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s would not rule out step-by-step approach to the problem; in
                        any case he preferred to leave this question to the judgment of experts who
                        he understood were now discussing the problem in NY.</p>
                    <p>I then inquired if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had given
                        any reconsideration to question of enlarging Security Council and <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> in order to meet desires for
                        representation by Afro-Asian bloc. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> took the initial position that progress toward this
                        end could be brought about only through revision of charter and that this
                        was impossible so long as we insisted on retention of the “Chiang
                        Kai-shekist clique” in China's permanent seat. Pointing out that <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s feel strongly that Chinese should be
                        legally represented in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and that
                        present arrangement in <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> view was
                        unlawful, he saw little point in pursuing further a question which had long
                        been at issue between us. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        felt that a possible alternative solution to problem of increasing
                        Afro-Asian representation might be redistribution of nonpermanent SC seats
                        and possibly also <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> slots but he
                        wished to make clear that if this method should be adopted there could be no
                        surrender of seats by “socialist countries.” I pointed out that <pb n="761" xml:id="pg_761" facs="0789"/>others felt same way as <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s about their established positions. I
                        therefore failed to see how redistribution would meet the problem in view of
                        the vastly increased size of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and urged
                        that some other solution should be found to meet the legitimate aspirations
                        of the Asians and Africans for representation.</p>
                    <p>Turning to subjects on which discussion had already been initiated, I
                        inquired if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would be prepared
                        in his <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> co-chairman capacity to
                        continue examination of such disarmament proposals as budget freeze,
                        surprise attack and observation posts which already begun in Geneva.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that he would be
                        prepared to discuss all questions which were on <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> agenda, as well as those which had been discussed in
                        Moscow during Secretary's visit, especially <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>With regard to <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss>, I said, as <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> aware, consultation with our allies
                        had been initiated and they had raised precisely those questions which
                        Secretary had foreseen, particularly need for linking <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> with situation of Berlin and access
                        thereto. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> commented that
                        access was related to broader question of German Peace Treaty and if we
                        should insist on relating it to <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> there
                        would be little chance of progress. I reminded him that at Pitsunda
                        Khrushchev had seemed to agree with Secretary's view that <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> should be crowning move in series of
                        separate steps toward the gradual elimination of tension. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> acknowledged that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had expressed such idea but that
                        what he meant was that ideally all problems should be resolved first and
                        then <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> concluded. This in the <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> view however was idealistic, not practical.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> agreed that a more
                        feasible approach was to proceed step by step but again stressed that
                        linking access with <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> was out of
                        question.</p>
                    <p>I referred to President's recent conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        <note n="3" xml:id="d354fn3">See <ref target="#d350">Document
                            350</ref>.</note> and stressed we continued to be disturbed at way
                        Soviet Union shirked its co-chairman responsibilities in Laos and adopted
                        partisan attitude, most recent example of this being <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> decision to publicize Souphanouvong <note n="4" xml:id="d354fn4">Prince Souphanouvong, Vice Premier of the Royal Laotian
                            Government.</note> charges while continuing deny same privilege to
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> charges of last
                        June, or to act on them. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said
                        that on subject of Laos he could add little to what he and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had already said to <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> and Secretary; Soviet Union stands
                        for a neutral, independent Laos but dispute between Princes was in <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> view an exclusively internal Laotian affair
                        in which <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s did not intend to interfere.
                        Meanwhile, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> wished to draw
                        attention to serious incidents of last few days in Vientiane which according
                        to <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> information were result of aggressive
                        action by Phoumi forces against small <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                        contingent. I pointed out that while I was not informed in detail as to
                        Vientiane situation there was <pb n="762" xml:id="pg_762" facs="0790"/>established machinery for investigation of such incidents and charges and
                        by agreement of co-chairmen this should be set in operation. It was not true
                        as <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said that we always
                        sided with Phoumi and denied right of Souphanouvong to be heard. In fact, we
                        supported <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> as we had
                        both agreed to do; unlike <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s, we have not
                        unilaterally aired Phoumi's side of story; we believed that when charges or
                        accusations are leveled by any element in the Laotian body politic all
                        should be objectively examined by the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> on
                        the basis of recommendations by the Geneva co-chairmen, especially those put
                        forward by head of govt.</p>
                    <p>Again citing President's conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> I asked <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> if his govt had given consideration to President's
                        broad, imaginative proposal for joint cooperation in outer space projects
                        and if he would be prepared to discuss this subject while in NY or
                        Washington. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said Sovs agreed
                        in principle with idea and he would of course be prepared to examine any
                        specific proposals US might have in mind. On other bilateral issues
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he would be prepared
                        to exchange views on trade question and civil aviation. He also agreed that
                        further possibilities of cooperation in the atomic energy field could be
                        explored by Petrosyants <note n="5" xml:id="d354fn5"> Andronik M.
                            Petrosyants, Chairman of the Soviet State Committee on Atomic

                        other measures to broaden exchanges could be dealt with in upcoming exchange
                        negotiations in Moscow.</p>
                    <p>In concluding the conversation I said to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> it would be helpful if I could take back with me
                        some encouraging word with regard to <gloss target="#t_EMB1">Emb</gloss>'s
                        communications problem. Almost plaintively <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he would look into the matter again but at this
                        point could promise nothing. Meanwhile he wished me to understand that no
                        policy question was involved here, that only “technical difficulties” stood
                        in way.</p>

                    <p>I met with the President for a bit over one-half hour.</p>
                    <p>After the initial greetings and picture-taking he referred to a letter he had
                        received from <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> asking that
                        reference to German reunification be included in his speech to the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>.<note n="2" xml:id="d355fn2">A copy of

                            President's address to the United Nations General Assembly, September
                            20, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United
                                States: <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">John F. Kennedy</persName>,
                                1963,</hi> pp. 693-698.</note> He asked whether I thought this would
                        create any problem. I replied that I had read a draft of the speech and
                        found it very good. I thought that if a reference could be included in
                        somewhat general terms related to self-determination, there would be no
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked for my views on the idea on cooperation in outer
                        space he had put forward to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        during their recent conversation.<note n="3" xml:id="d355fn3">See <ref target="#d350">Document 350</ref>.</note> I told him that I had
                        discussed this with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> who had
                        considered the suggestion an “interesting” idea.<note n="4" xml:id="d355fn4">See <ref target="#d354">Document 354</ref>.</note> However, I had the
                        impression the Soviets were both intrigued and puzzled about just what the
                        President might have had in mind. Consequently, while giving a cautious
                        welcome to the idea, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had
                        asked that we come up with some concrete suggestions as to what might be
                        done in this field. The President said that, although this had not been an
                        idea that he had considered in detail, he continued to be interested in
                        developing it and thought it would in fact be useful, for example, and save
                        a great deal of expense if we could come to some kind of agreement with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on the problem of sending a man to
                        the moon. I reaffirmed that I thought there might be some real interest in
                        developing cooperation in this field since <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had a problem of allocation of extremely limited
                        resources which made the President's problem relatively simple.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked my views as to what the Russians had in mind
                        discussing during <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s visit. I
                        said that of course the Russian <pb n="764" xml:id="pg_764" facs="0792"/>prime projects which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            [<hi rend="italic">
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        </hi>?] would put forward were a non-aggression pact proposal and some
                        version of the fixed control post idea. However, I thought they understood
                        that we were entangled with our allies in both of these problems and would
                        be unable to go very far during the upcoming talks. There were some measures
                        in the disarmament/security field which might be discussed some with
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. However, I did not see
                        how we could get very far in substance with these partial measures here,
                        though some agreement in principle might be reached to guide further
                        discussions in Geneva. Consequently, the only field left in which I could
                        see possibilities of something concrete emerging was that of bilateral
                        interests. I personally hoped very much that we could go ahead now with the
                        civil air agreement which was initialed a couple of years ago and in return
                        get from the Russians a leased line to Western Europe for the improvement of
                        the Embassy's communications. I mentioned that some people seemed to be
                        thinking we could get much more, such as a Berlin settlement, in return for
                        the civil air agreement but I did not think we could sell this horse a
                        second time at such a price. I thought we would do well and that our
                        interests would be served if we could get the civil air agreement, which I
                        considered to be in our interest anyway, together with improvement in
                        Embassy communications. The President appeared to me to indicate general
                        agreement with these observations. I said that in addition to this I would
                        hope that we could discuss two other questions of bilateral interest: a
                        Consular Convention with the promise it held of opening up consular offices
                        in the two countries, a process which would be to our advantage; and trade,
                        a subject which was of great interest to the Soviets and which would
                        presumably be of mutual benefit. There ensued considerable discussion,
                        particularly of the trade aspect, during which I responded to the
                        President's question about the status of the <persName>Johnson</persName>

                            574) It was amended on July 31, 1945, to exempt foreign governments that
                            were members of both the International Monetary Fund and the
                            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development from some of its
                            provisions. (59 Stat. 516)</note> the possibility that this could be
                        interpreted to permit three to five year credits for Soviet purchases of
                        large-scale installations; the limited possibilities of a large development
                        of trade in any event; and related matters. The President expressed his
                        interest in moving as much as we could in the trade field. In this
                        connection he referred to the Canadian and Australian sales of wheat to the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, indicating some regret that we
                        had not been able to do this ourselves, but agreeing that the disposition of
                        Canadian and Australian surpluses would presumably open up some outlets for
                        our own. The President also said he thought the handling of the subject of
                        trade was too dispersed in the government and that he had dictated a memo
                            <pb n="765" xml:id="pg_765" facs="0793"/>suggesting that the question be
                        put into the hands of a responsible official who could pull it together and
                        ensure a more effective exploration of the possibilities in this field.<note n="6" xml:id="d355fn6">Not further identified.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>In response to his inquiry about the handling of these further questions I
                        told him that work was going forward in the Department preparing position
                        papers and that the Secretary would presumably be discussing these matters
                        with him before leaving for New York.</p>
                    <p>The President asked about the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> role in talks
                        with the Soviets. This led to some discussion of the previous quadripartite
                        meetings with the Soviets; of the difficulties occasioned by French
                        non-participation; and of the field of mutual interest on a tripartite basis
                        illustrated by the test ban treaty negotiations. I said, however, that while
                        at least one tripartite meeting would be necessary, the Russians were
                        clearly interested principally in talking on a bilateral basis with us. I
                        said that if we could come out with a civil air agreement and improved
                        Embassy communications together with some agreement in principle on consular
                        and trade relations to be the subject of continuing negotiations, I thought
                        this would serve the purpose of maintaining a forward movement. The
                        President nodded agreement.</p>
                    <p>The President also inquired about relations between Moscow and Peiping. He
                        asked whether in the event of the death of either <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> or Mao or both the present
                        conflict might be terminated and a close relationship restored. After saying
                        that I was sure there could be no reconciliation during the existence of the
                        present leadership, I said it was possible that there could be an ostensible
                        reconciliation between the Russian and Chinese Communists. However, even in
                        this case I thought it would be a temporary relationship. Fundamentally, I
                        thought the cleavage rested on national factors. Specifically, from the
                        Russian point of view, the Russians were simply not going to share the
                        wealth with the Chinese as would be required on a basis of pure Communist
                        theory; and the Russians were not going to permit the Chinese actions to
                        involve them in a nuclear conflict with the U.S.</p>
                    <p>The President asked about Russian views of the multilateral force and
                        non-dissemination. I told him that while the Russians were aware of the
                        difficulties we were having with the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> and
                        thus not at present in a state of acute concern, they would never agree to
                        any non-dissemination formula which would allow for and seem to give their
                        blessing to <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. Consequently, I could see
                        no prospect of any agreement on this subject. The President expressed his
                        agreement saying that he saw no reason why Moscow should agree from their
                        point of view.</p>
                    <pb n="766" xml:id="pg_766" facs="0794"/>
                    <p>The President asked whether he would see me again. I told him that I hoped so
                        and assumed that I might accompany the Secretary in discussions he might
                        have with the President about the talks with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. He asked when he would see <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and I told him nothing was fixed
                        but that I assumed it would be somewhat later on. He also asked when I would
                        be back in Moscow and I told him that my present plans were to return the
                        first week in October.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>As Chairman of the Interagency Committee on International Aviation Policy I
                        convened a meeting of representatives of the member agencies on September
                            18<note n="2" xml:id="d356fn2">A list of agency representation at this
                            meeting is attached, but not printed.</note> to consider the
                        desirability of signing at this time the bilateral Air Transport Agreement
                        that was negotiated in 1961. The general consensus of the meeting was that
                        there were no insuperable difficulties to prevent consummation of the
                        Agreement if this were considered advisable for political reasons. However,
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would acquire certain political
                        advantages. The operation of the route would not be expected, at least in
                        its initial stages, to prove profitable for the designated United States
                        airline. Furthermore it was noted that the Russian airline would gain much
                        more in route mileage than the designated United States airline, which
                        already operates transatlantic schedules, and would additionally have the
                        advantage of drawing traffic from points behind Moscow. Therefore it was
                        felt that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should make concessions
                        for United States concurrence in the signing. Possible concessions suggested
                        were approval of a leased teletype line to our Embassy in Moscow and
                        conclusion of a consular convention.</p>
                    <pb n="767" xml:id="pg_767" facs="0795"/>
                    <p>The meeting also recognized that if an agreement were signed, our policies
                        with regard to aviation relations between the United States and the Soviet
                        Bloc states would have to be reviewed and our attitude toward third-country
                        aviation relations with Soviet Bloc states would have to be re-considered.
                        Our current efforts to obtain support for denial of Bloc airline rights in
                        developing countries and further to prevent Bloc operations through these
                        countries to third countries, e.g., Cuba, would be made more difficult.</p>
                    <p>The question of the time interval needed between the signing of the agreement
                        and its going into operational effect was also brought up at the meeting.
                        Mr. Halaby, the Federal Aviation Agency Administrator, pointed out that
                        although the technical annex to the proposed agreement was still
                        unsatisfactory, execution of some of its provisions could probably not be
                        completed in less than six to nine months. It is understood that Pan
                        American World Airways would likewise wish a commensurate time lag before
                        initiating its service. Therefore some determination will have to be made on
                        when the Agreement will become mutually effective for operational purposes.
                        This is already provided for in the Agreement by a stipulation that the
                        contracting parties will by a subsequent exchange of notes specify a date on
                        which the agreed services may commence.</p>

                            exploration of space. I include among these possibilities a joint

                    </p>
                    <p>2. The Central Intelligence Agency has consistently characterized the Soviet
                        space effort as a simple but aggressive one utilizing the launch <pb n="768" xml:id="pg_768" facs="0796"/>vehicles and facilities which in essence
                        constituted the early Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program.
                        From this base the program developed along simple lines using existing
                        military hardware with as few new developments as possible and, until
                        recently, with no variety. Since 1960 no significant change has occurred in
                        Soviet launch capability.</p>
                    <p>3. From its commencement in 1957 until the present, the Soviet program has
                        reflected the belief that achievements in space will persuade the world that
                        in the realms of science, technology, and military strength, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> surpasses all other nations in the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>4. From the very early launchings the program has gradually broadened until
                        it consists of five fairly discrete elements with well-defined purposes.
                        These elements are the Kapustin Yar Cosmos series, the Tyuratam Cosmos
                        series, a manned spaceflight program, an interplanetary program, and a lunar
                        program. The total scope of this effort is not nearly so broad as that of
                        the U.S. effort and reflects a selective choice of missions in the face of
                        some limitations.</p>
                    <p>5. The Kapustin Yar Cosmos series is an astrogeophysical research project
                        involving small payloads and begun in 1962, probably in response to demands
                        by Soviet scientists for an opportunity to conduct the types of experiments
                        in space that were being carried out in large numbers by U.S. scientists.
                        This series appears to be limited to this purpose and is not suited for a
                        reconnaissance mission despite suggestions that this might be the case by
                        other members of the intelligence community.</p>
                    <p>6. A major purpose of the Tyuratam Cosmos series is almost certainly the
                        development of a meteorological satellite. We believe that it is this
                        satellite which the Soviets will use to fulfill its commitments in the
                        cooperative agreement between the Academy of Sciences and <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss>. The characteristics of the system [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] appear to be
                        adequate to do this and provide much higher resolution than planned U.S.
                        systems. Because the vehicles used in this series are all recovered and some
                        differences between vehicles have been noted, it is impossible to rule out
                        the possibility that they might be engaged in reconnaissance or geodetic
                        missions. Technical analysis has as yet revealed no firm positive
                        indications of such missions, however.</p>
                    <p>7. In general, we have found no good evidence of the existence of Soviet
                        plans or programs for the military use of space. While military support
                        missions such as reconnaissance or geodetic fixing may possibly be
                        undertaken, we consider it generally unlikely that the Soviets will deploy
                        orbital bombardment systems in this decade. This position has been well
                        defined in <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-9-63.<note n="3" xml:id="d357fn3">“Soviet Capabilities and Intentions to Orbit Nuclear

                    <p>8. The Soviet manned space flight program is a conservative, well planned
                        effort based upon the use of systems proven to be safe and reliable. Its
                        long-term goals unquestionably include manned lunar landings and
                        interplanetary flights but there is no evidence that their program is
                        progressing on a crash basis. Current emphasis in Soviet bioastronautics
                        work appears to center about the study of problems and the development of
                        systems related to prolonged space flights and appears more responsive to
                        the needs of a space station than to landing a man on the moon.</p>
                    <p>9. The interplanetary program is one characterized by failure but
                        nevertheless vigorously pursued. It is expected that it will continue and
                        that launchings will occur as suitable opportunities arise.</p>
                    <p>10. Lunar launchings were resumed in January of this year after a long
                        hiatus, with the purpose of getting detailed data on the nature of the
                        surface of the moon. We believe these probes were intended to soft-land on
                        the moon but they may have been lunar orbiters with a mapping and
                        reconnaissance mission. These probes were all failures, although Lunik 4 was
                        successfully ejected from parking orbit but failed to fulfill its mission.
                        The above points have been covered in briefings and in numerous OSI
                        Scientific Intelligence Digests. It is estimated, on the basis of apparent
                        constraints of celestial mechanics, that attempts to gather lunar surface
                        data will begin again late in November of this year.</p>
                    <p>11. In our briefings and papers, <gloss target="#t_OSI1">OSI</gloss> has
                        stated its belief that the Soviets intend to compete vigorously in the early
                        exploration of the moon and that this effort will include manned flights,
                        although not manned lunar landings. A circumlunar manned flight is not an
                        unreasonable mission in terms of currently existing Soviet launch vehicles
                        once the rendezvous and docking techniques have been developed. A manned
                        lunar orbiting mission might be accomplished, but to be practicable it would
                        require a booster about twice as large as the SS-6. A clear purpose of such
                        missions would be to enhance the prestige of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and to offset the impact of an early manned lunar landing
                        by the U.S.</p>
                    <p>12. We have also taken the position that it is not yet possible to settle
                        with assurance the question as to whether or not the Soviets are engaged in
                        a manned lunar landing program competitive with the United States. The
                        analytical problem has essentially been one of not being able to find
                        definitive indications of their being in such a race while having to admit
                        that such indicators might exist without our being able to discover and
                        identify them. Time is rapidly running out on this situation, however. In
                        December 1962 in <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-1-62,<note n="4" xml:id="d357fn4">“Soviet Space Programs,” December 5, 1962.
                            (Ibid.)</note> it was estimated that there was a better than even chance
                        that the Soviets had a competitive manned lunar landing <pb n="770" xml:id="pg_770" facs="0798"/>program though no firm conclusion could be
                        reached. A later review of pertinent material produced essentially the same
                        judgment. We still can find no firm evidence of the existence of such a
                        program, but have, because of the passage of time, estimated that the
                        chances of its existence are now something less than even. Though we have
                        predicted the flight testing of a new larger booster and a new manned
                        capsule, we still have no firm evidence of their early introduction. In
                        addition, the Soviets have in the interim accomplished none of the technical
                        prerequisites for a manned lunar landing outlined in <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-1-62. This suggests, as well, that the Soviets might not
                        have progressed to the point where they can make any substantial
                        contribution to a cooperative program. Lovell's conversations are perhaps
                        indicative in this regard but cannot be considered as conclusive evidence of
                        a Soviet decision not to conduct a manned lunar landing.</p>
                    <p>13. In our view, if the Soviets are not engaged in an all-out manned landing
                        program, we expect them to substitute major goals or somehow reduce the
                        effects of the U.S. accomplishment of this mission. A cooperative venture
                        with the U.S. for a manned lunar landing would reduce the Soviet problems in
                        this regard tremendously. Where the question of cooperation has arisen, we
                        have been most skeptical of both the technical feasibility of such a venture
                        and of its long-term advantages. Goals likely to be substituted by the
                        Soviets include the early lunar missions mentioned above and the
                        establishment of a space station. Current Soviet capabilities would allow
                        them to establish several different types of orbiting stations.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sino-Soviet Relations</p>
                    <p>Moscow and Peiping are relentlessly pursuing their political warfare aimed at
                        discrediting each other and winning the allegiance of foreign parties. The
                        Chinese and Soviet parties are each apparently <pb n="771" xml:id="pg_771" facs="0799"/>operating on the assumption that the conflict will be
                        protracted and inconclusive. Neither side seems to believe that the other
                        will allow itself to be provoked into some irreparable action that would
                        precipitate a complete break in party relations and possibly even diplomatic
                        ties. At the same time, each party is making strenuous efforts to place
                        itself in the strongest possible position in the event they are forced into
                        open rupture.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet leaders clearly are confident that Peiping's refusal to sign the
                        nuclear test ban treaty has provided them with a potent weapon in their
                        drive to discredit and isolate the Chinese Communists. The long Soviet
                        Government statement published on 21 and 22 September<note n="2" xml:id="d358fn2">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Current Digest of the
                                Soviet Press</hi>, vol. XV, No. 38, October 16, 1963, pp.
                            3-15.</note> claimed that the Chinese have suffered a “serious moral and
                        political defeat” and that their rejection of the treaty “amounts to
                        complete apostasy” from the world Communist line. The whole thrust of the
                        statement was to portray the Chinese leaders as bloodthirsty warmongers who
                        are ready to embark on irresponsible adventures. It warned that Peiping's
                        desire to acquire nuclear weapons causes “serious doubts concerning the
                        foreign policy aims of China's leaders,” and charged that they are committed
                        to a “military solution of the contradictions between socialism and
                        capitalism.”</p>
                    <p>The Soviet statement replied to recent Chinese charges of Soviet subversive
                        activities in Sinkiang Province by claiming that Chinese “servicemen and
                        civilians” have “systematically violated” the Soviet frontier since 1960.
                        Moscow for the first time took notice of Peiping's declared intention to
                        revise or abrogate “unjust” territorial settlements imposed on China by the
                        “imperialists.” The statement warned that “artificial creation” of
                        territorial disputes would mean “embarking on a very dangerous path” and
                        strongly implied that Moscow will refuse to recognize Peiping's claims.</p>
                    <p>In the latest polemical exchanges both parties have gone so far as to call
                        into question each other's readiness to fulfill commitments under the
                        Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1950. Peiping repeatedly has cast doubt on Soviet
                        commitments and has accused the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> of
                        “flagrant violations” of the treaty. The Soviet statement charged Peiping
                        with seeking to justify its desire to acquire nuclear weapons by denouncing
                        Moscow as an “undependable ally.” It warned the Chinese against assuming
                        that they could enjoy Soviet nuclear protection and at the same time
                        continue to attack the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. To underscore
                        this warning, Moscow quoted the Russian proverb: “Do not foul the well; you
                        may need its waters.”</p>
                    <p>The Soviet statement concluded with a pro forma appeal for a cessation of
                        polemics, but also with a thinly veiled threat of unspecified retaliatory
                        actions if Peiping persists in attacking the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. It warned that the <pb n="772" xml:id="pg_772" facs="0800"/>Chinese “must clearly realize that the most resolute rebuff
                        from the Soviet party and people awaits them on this road.” Moscow's
                        handling of two recent frontier train incidents suggests that any future
                        Soviet reprisals may include a drastic curtailment or complete termination
                        of the Chinese training program in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. It is possible that the Russians are even contemplating a
                        complete break in economic relations along the lines of Soviet action
                        against Albania in 1961. There are also rumors in Moscow of a Soviet
                        decision to break state relations with Peiping.</p>
                    <p>A <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> article on 19 September, which blamed the
                        Chinese for the failure to settle the Sino-Indian border dispute,
                        constitutes Moscow's strongest and most extensive criticism to date of
                        Peiping's policy on this issue. In an obvious attempt to discredit China in
                        Afro-Asian eyes, <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> deplored Peiping's refusal to
                        “listen to the voice of reason” as embodied in the Colombo proposals of
                        December 1962 and accused the Chinese of playing into the hands of the
                        imperialists.</p>
                    <p>Peiping has shown its extreme sensitivity to Moscow's damaging charges that
                        the Chinese leaders are “war maniacs”—inadvertently confirmed by a fumbling
                        Chinese attempt on 1 September to “explain” Mao's remarks in 1957 concerning
                        the probable outcome of a nuclear conflict<note n="3" xml:id="d358fn3">A

                        which they have the better weapons. In the second major Chinese article in
                        the projected series replying to the Soviet party pronouncement of 14 July,
                        People's Daily on 13 September adopted a disdainful, patronizing tone toward
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and assumed the role
                        of faithful defender of Communist orthodoxy against the heretical Soviet
                        premier.</p>
                    <p>The article, which was designed to exploit the disarray and demoralization in
                        foreign parties created by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s attacks on Stalin, was addressed primarily to
                        hard-line factions in these parties to whom Peiping looks for support. It
                        tried to show that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is
                        unworthy to head the world Communist movement and defined the ideal
                        “head-quarters of the proletariat” in terms which fit only the Chinese
                        Communist Party.</p>
                    <p>The article struck directly at <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s most vulnerable point by emphasizing that he
                        had been “particularly active” in carrying out Stalin's suppression of
                        Soviet “counterrevolutionaries” in the 1930s. With surpassing insolence,
                        Peiping claimed that even a majority of people in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> itself disapproved of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s attacks and “cherish” Stalin's
                        memory.</p>

                    <p>While the Chinese strain to gain adherents outside China, there are
                        indications that the Sino-Soviet rift, added to domestic economic
                        difficulties, is creating morale problems in China. According to a report of
                        an official inquiry into popular attitudes in a county of Kwangtung
                        Province, many people are alarmed by the loss of Soviet support for
                        industrialization and are pessimistic about the future. The US consul
                        general in Hong Kong comments that this and another recent report show that
                        Peiping's challenge to Moscow—while appealing to Chinese xenophobia—has also
                        generated apprehension over the regime's motives and possibly deepened
                        doubts about its present course. (Confidential)</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Foreign Policy Outlook</p>
                    <p>The dominant factor shaping Moscow's present foreign policy outlook appears
                        to be its desire to avoid new crisis situations with the West while dealing
                        with the increasingly bitter and damaging struggle with the Chinese
                        Communists for leadership of the Communist movement. The serious economic
                        problems facing the Soviet leaders, highlighted by the recent large-scale
                        grain purchases in the West, probably have also strengthened their interest
                        in a general improvement in Soviet-Western relations.</p>
                    <p>The moderate and “statesmanlike” tone of Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s speech to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly on 19 September<note n="4" xml:id="d358fn4">For excerpts from the text, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1963</hi>, pp. 509-524.</note> was the
                        most recent example of Soviet efforts to encourage a détente atmosphere. He
                        urged all governments to use the favorable situation created by the test ban
                        treaty to agree on further measures to ease tension and he carefully
                        refrained from direct criticisms of US policy in such sensitive areas as
                        Cuba and Southeast Asia. He gave only perfunctory attention to the German
                        and Berlin problems and repeated <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s theme that, from the bloc viewpoint, the Berlin
                        Wall has reduced the urgency of a German peace treaty.</p>
                    <p>In keeping with longstanding Soviet “détente tactics,” <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s speech focused primarily on
                        disarmament. His proposals for a heads-of-government meeting of the
                        18-nation disarmament committee during the first half of 1964 and for a
                        US-Soviet treaty banning nuclear weapons in outer space were intended to
                        demonstrate the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s constructive
                        attitude. He also sought to underline Soviet flexibility by offering a
                        further “concession” in Moscow's general disarmament plan which would permit
                        the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to retain a limited
                        number of missiles and nuclear weapons until the end of the last stage of
                        the disarmament process.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet leaders appear to see little early prospect for further agreements
                        comparable to the test ban in importance. They are under no pressure, and
                        they remain unwilling to make concessions as the price for agreement on
                        major issues such as Berlin and Germany. They probably <pb n="774" xml:id="pg_774" facs="0802"/>believe, moreover, that West German and
                        French opposition will preclude agreement on such measures as a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw Pact nonaggression treaty, a
                        reduction of foreign forces in the two Germanys, and a nuclear-free zone in
                        Central Europe. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, however,
                        probably hopes to draw the US and its allies into a protracted period of
                        negotiation on partial disarmament and European security matters. He would
                        calculate that such talks would intensify differences among the Western
                        allies and increase the reluctance of some <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members to proceed further with a multilateral <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear force.</p>
                    <p>While the Russians see no present opportunities for advancing their aims on
                        major European questions, they apparently attach considerable importance to
                        further bilateral agreements with the US as a means of keeping alive the
                        momentum and atmosphere created by the test ban treaty. In addition to
                        Soviet interest in agreements banning nuclear weapons in outer space and
                        establishing legal principles for the peaceful uses of space, Moscow has
                        indicated a desire to conclude a consular convention and a civil air
                        transport agreement.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> summarized the
                        Canadian-Soviet wheat negotiations.<note n="2" xml:id="d359fn2">On September
                            16 the Soviet Union and Canada completed an agreement for the sale of
                            5.3 million tons of wheat.</note> He then gave the latest information
                        about a group of grain traders <pb n="775" xml:id="pg_775" facs="0803"/>who
                        are interested in selling U.S. wheat to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He called attention to the purchase by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> of flour from West Germany which had been
                        milled from wheat sold to the West Germans by the U.S. He said the U.S. had
                        ample surplus of wheat to sell the three million tons which the Russians
                        allegedly are interested in purchasing. He was ready to make the sale if the
                        President decided to do so.</p>
                    <p>In response to the President's question, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> estimated that the Russians were
                        interested in purchasing between $150 million and $200 million worth of
                        wheat at present prices—approximately three million tons. In response to a
                        second question by the President, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> said we had no indication that the Russians were
                        interested in purchasing other commodities, such as cotton or oil.</p>
                    <p>Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> reported on his
                        appearance before a Senate Committee yesterday in which he set forth the
                        pros and cons of a U.S. wheat deal with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He said that even the Senators favorable to a wheat deal
                        are concerned about Congressional reaction if the Administration agreed to a
                        wheat deal without regard to the Latta amendment.<note n="3" xml:id="d359fn3">For text of the Latta amendment, see Section 2(c) of
                            the Agriculture Act of 1961, 75 Stat. 294.</note> This amendment states
                        that it is the policy of Congress that sale of agricultural commodities are
                        to be made only to “friendly nations.” Those Senators favoring the sale
                        believe that the Administration will be criticized because of acting
                        contrary to this statement of Congressional policy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we could say that conditions have
                        changed since 1961 when the amendment was approved and that the deal we were
                        making with the Soviet Union was a single sale. The question remained,
                        however, as to how to deal with a Congressional statement which seeks to
                        limit the President's area of decision. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stated the pros and cons of the wheat deal from the
                        international political viewpoint:</p>
                    <p>1. The purchase by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> of large amounts
                        of wheat can be portrayed as a failure of Communism. The Soviet system is
                        unable to provide sufficient food for its citizens and has to come to the
                        West in order to meet its food needs.</p>
                    <p>2. The purchase of U.S. wheat diverts Soviet resources from arms to food.
                        Soviet monetary reserves are not unlimited. In order to pay for the wheat,
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would have to use gold, which
                        costs the Soviets about $65 an ounce to produce and is worth only $35 an
                        ounce on the world market.</p>
                    <p>3. We have a long tradition of helping the Russian people in periods of
                        famine. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> recalls comments
                        by Russians made to him during World War II about the Hoover food relief
                        campaign of World War I. If we turned down the Soviet deal, we would be
                        breaking this tradition.</p>
                    <p>4. During the months it would take to deliver the wheat to the Soviet Union,
                        the Soviet Government would be prompted to maintain a status quo lest the
                        wheat delivery be halted.</p>
                    <pb n="776" xml:id="pg_776" facs="0804"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said the arguments against
                        the deal are:</p>
                    <p>1. The Soviets have grain resources and therefore are not in absolute need of
                        U.S. wheat.</p>
                    <p>2. Some of the wheat sold to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would
                        undoubtedly be shipped to Soviet satellites.</p>
                    <p>3. If we engage in trade of this magnitude with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, it will be difficult for us to continue to urge the
                        underdeveloped nations to avoid becoming economically dependent on the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The result would probably be that
                        underdeveloped nations would increase their trade with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In response to a question, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> said that we had sold very little to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> primarily because the Soviets had never
                        asked to purchase our grain. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName> commented that during 1962 we had sold approximately
                        $62 million worth of food products to all the satellites. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said the Russians knew that we would
                        have sold food products to them if they had asked us.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName> said he believed we
                        should sell the wheat to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. On the
                        basis of his appearance yesterday before the Senate Committee, he thought
                        that those who opposed the wheat deal do so on a partisan basis. He noted
                        that the Commerce Department would receive today a request from a U.S.
                        trader for a license to sell three million tons of wheat to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Czech Government officials have called
                        on him twice. In talking to the Czechs, he had tried to discuss the
                        immediate spot grain situation. However, the Czechs kept talking about trade
                        relations with them in the future. He said one way to proceed would be to
                        decide what we would do with a request for a license to ship wheat then wait
                        thirty days to see what Congressional reaction would be. The President read
                        the following extract from the attached memorandum from Assist-ant Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DFG1">Dutton</persName>, dated September 30:<note n="4" xml:id="d359fn4">Not found.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>“As a procedural matter, the wheat sale should not be consummated until the
                        Administration has obtained formal action by both Houses reconsidering the
                        so-called Latta amendment to the Agricultural Act of 1961, expressing the
                        sense of Congress that subsidized commodities should not be sold to the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.” The President asked whether
                        formal action by the Congress was necessary. Both Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> said they did not think formal
                        action was required.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> commented that in 1961
                        Congress could have included in the Agriculture Surplus Law the statement
                        contained in the Latta amendment. Congress, however, did not do so, but
                        chose rather to state merely the policy it thought should be followed. The
                        Congress did not choose to tie the President's hands. The President,
                        therefore, could act in the national interest as he saw fit. He could say
                        that he had decided <pb n="777" xml:id="pg_777" facs="0805"/>to sell wheat
                        to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> after consultation with the
                        Congress and on the basis of public support. He repeated an earlier
                        statement to the effect that Senator Ellender,<note n="5" xml:id="d359fn5">
                            Allen J. Ellender, Chairman of the Senate Agriculture and Forestry
                            Committee.</note> who favored the deal, acknowledged that there would be
                        Congressional grumbling if the President chose to act contrary to the
                        Congressional statement of policy.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> said that Senator
                        Ellender had told him last night that he did not want the Administration to
                        ask for Congressional action. Senator Ellender favors the sale and had meant
                        to make clear during the afternoon hearing merely the Congressional
                        sensitivity involved in dealing with the Latta amendment. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> said that the people who
                        are against the wheat deal will use the Latta amendment as the basis of
                        their opposition, but that the overwhelming majority of the Congress would
                        favor the wheat sale.</p>
                    <p>Acting Secretary Gilpatric <note n="6" xml:id="d359fn6"> Roswell L.
                            Gilpatric, Deputy Secretary of Defense.</note> said that the Joint
                        Chiefs' view and his and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>'s
                        personal view was that there was no military or strategic objection to the
                        sale of wheat to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as a one-shot
                        operation.</p>
                    <p>In response to the President's question, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> said that the price of wheat sold
                        to the Russians would be the same as that offered to any buyer. The wheat
                        would come out of <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> stocks and would be
                        sold at 105% of the loan rate. The transaction would be negotiated and
                        implemented by private traders. The Government would not get into it because
                        it was not staffed to do so. The private traders would be pleased to have
                        the business and the farmers would be pleased because they would expect that
                        a sizable sale would have an eventual beneficial effect on wheat prices.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> said the Soviets
                        may ask for a fixed price. Possibly we could agree on a price ceiling. In
                        other words, we could merely announce that licenses will be issued to
                        traders who wish to sell U.S. wheat to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the Soviet satellites, or we could officially
                        negotiate with the Soviet Government on a flexible price. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> opposed a fixed price. If
                        a private trader negotiated the price and undertook to deliver the wheat,
                        their profit margin would be narrow because the wheat trading business is
                        highly competitive. There is no danger of profiteering or windfall profits.
                        Mr. <persName>Sorensen</persName> added that under certain circumstances the
                        traders could even take a loss on the deal.</p>
                    <p>In response to the President's question, Under Secretary Murphy <note n="7" xml:id="d359fn7">Under Secretary of Agriculture, Charles S.
                            Murphy.</note> said he had nothing to add to what had already been said
                        and he noted that although the economic and commercial pros of the wheat
                        deal are important, they are not of sufficient importance to override any
                        cons based on national security considerations.</p>
                    <pb n="778" xml:id="pg_778" facs="0806"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> thought that the
                        deal would have a beneficial political effect in U.S. wheat growing
                        areas.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said that
                        George Meany was strongly opposed to trading with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> but approved the sale of U.S. wheat.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName> said he had talked to
                        Meany, who had agreed not to oppose the deal for the time being and to hold
                        off efforts to encourage longshoremen to refuse to load U.S. wheat going to
                        Russia.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> noted that we may get a
                        request from the Soviet Union for the extension of credit. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> pointed out that we could
                        extend regular commercial credit up to eighteen months.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> commented that the
                        Soviets will get the wheat they need one way or another. If we do not sell
                        it to them, they will always be in a position to buy U.S. wheat which we
                        have sold to European States.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that if we decide to go ahead with the wheat deal we
                        should make clear in any statement issued at the time that the Russians
                        would be able to get U.S. wheat whether we sold it to them or not.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> said the Russians
                        could obtain 300,000 tons of flour from West Germany, most of which was
                        milled from U.S. wheat. The President asked whether we would sell to the
                        Germans if we knew in advance that they were going to resell the wheat to
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> replied that we
                        would be happy to make such a sale to the Germans. He went on to say that
                        when he saw <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>,<note n="8" xml:id="d359fn8">See <ref target="#d341fn7">footnote 7, Document
                                341</ref>.</note> the Soviet leader did not raise the purchase of
                        wheat and said that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would not buy
                        food. The Russian crop was said to be normal. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> commented that the recent grain
                        purchases had apparently been decided upon after he had been in the Soviet
                        Union and presumably after the Russians had realized the extent of their
                        crop failure.</p>
                    <p>In response to the President's question, Acting <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Director Carter said he had no comment.</p>
                    <p>Governor Herter pointed out that in the State Department memorandum there was
                        mention of the possibility of prohibiting the resale by the Soviet Union of
                        U.S. wheat to Communist China, Korea, Vietnam and Cuba. He felt that if this
                        could be done, the reaction in Congress would be beneficial. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName> replied that such
                        limitations on resale could be accomplished by including this requirement in
                        the U.S. license for the sale.</p>
                    <p>The President asked what was the next step; would we merely announce that we
                        were granting licenses for the sale of wheat to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and that the traders could apply for license?</p>
                    <pb n="779" xml:id="pg_779" facs="0807"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> said that an effort
                        had been made by the private U.S. traders to organize a group to deal with
                        the Soviet negotiators in Montreal. However, the group broke apart primarily
                        because the traders thought they might do better operating alone. The
                        competition for the grain deal would be cutthroat. The licenses would merely
                        be issued to the traders.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">East-West Relations</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that it was important not to have any illusions about the
                        current status of East-West relations. It was premature to speak of a
                        détente. There have been two concrete developments: a hot line between
                        Moscow and Washington, reserved for emergencies, has been established as a
                        result of the Cuba crisis when normal communications between the two
                        governments could no longer keep in step with developments. This line has
                        not been used as yet. Secondly, a limited test ban agreement has been
                        concluded.</p>
                    <p>On concrete problems, there has been no sign of a real detente. With regard
                        to Laos, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said that the
                        Soviets remained committed <pb n="780" xml:id="pg_780" facs="0808"/>to the
                        Geneva accords and that things would be much worse if they weren't.
                        Nevertheless, the situation was far from good. Polish members of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> remain uncooperative and the Viet Minh
                        presence in Laos continues.</p>
                    <p>On Vietnam, there was a complete impasse.</p>
                    <p>With regard to Cuba, the Soviets were telling us that there were no longer
                        any Soviet operational military units there and that only technicians and
                        training personnel were left. We have indications that the Soviets have
                        indeed removed four battalions but they continue to man anti-aircraft
                        installations and are maintaining some 7,000 military personnel. <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> continues to interfere with other
                        countries in the Western hemisphere. The Soviets have perhaps prevented Cuba
                        from erupting, but Soviet military presence and Soviet interferences in the
                        Western hemisphere remain non-negotiable issues. Continuing on Cuba, the
                        Secretary said that we understood there were two main schools of thought in
                        Cuba: a pro-Soviet and a pro-Chinese orientation. Perhaps there was also
                        some Titoist sentiment but we had been unable to discern any movement in
                        favor of reconciliation with the West. The Secretary expressed his
                        appreciation for previous reports received from the French Embassy in Havana
                        and said he hoped that we would continue to receive these reports. Couve
                        indicated we would.</p>
                    <p>On Berlin, there were also no new developments. If the Soviets gave full
                        assurances on accession and concentrated on East Germany, some pressure on
                        us from neutrals might develop. As yet, there were no indications that the
                        Soviets would move in this direction but the possibility remained that they
                        might adopt such a course. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        had described the situation as “important and acute”.</p>
                    <p>With regard to Eastern Europe, we had noticed a slight improvement. No
                        Americans were imprisoned any longer in Czechoslovakia. Some progress had
                        been made in negotiations on the settlement of old financial claims. The
                        Rumanian Foreign Minister had stated that he was interested in improving
                        relations with the West. None of these developments were in any sense
                        conclusive.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Gromyko Talks</p>
                    <p>Turning to the recent discussions with Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        <note n="2" xml:id="d360fn2">For a report on the conversation on October 2,
                            see ibid., pp. 583-584; a summary of the second conversation, October 3,
                            which included Lord Home, is in Department of State, Central Files, POL
                            38-10.</note> the Secretary said that Gromyko had not taken the
                        initiative in mentioning the non-aggression pact. It was U Thant <note n="3" xml:id="d360fn3">Secretary General of the United Nations.</note> who had
                        done so. We considered the <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss> a non-starter
                        because the Soviets had indicated that they considered it an item per se and
                        refused to link it with an improvement <pb n="781" xml:id="pg_781" facs="0809"/>in the Berlin situation. Moreover, there was a great deal
                        of skepticism in this country regarding the meaning of an <gloss target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss>. Such a pact could come at the end of a
                        settlement of issues but not at the outset.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said the Soviets had shown interest in a non-dissemination
                        agreement and had taken the initiative in bringing this up. The Soviets
                        seemed to desire that the four existing nuclear powers should remain the
                        only ones. On the other hand, the Soviets had taken the position that the
                        Multilateral Force would be incompatible with a non-dissemination agreement.
                        Soviet opposition to the Multilateral Force may be based on their
                        apprehension at seeing the resources of Europe mobilized along with ours in
                        the nuclear field. On the other hand, Soviet opposition to the Multilateral
                        Force could be based on concern with regard to Germany. If this were the
                        case, the Soviets might take a different view once the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> comes into being and once they have a
                        chance to look at it in detail.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary reminded M. Couve de Murville that he had once said that it
                        would be an important point if the Soviets agreed on observation posts.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had discussed observation
                        posts but had linked them to the concept of a denuclearized zone and to
                        troop reductions.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the Soviets had shown no interest in agreed
                        destruction of weapons (B-47's and Badgers). We were interested in such an
                        agreement because we would like to prevent or at least limit the
                        introduction of these weapons in the Near East and countries like
                        Indonesia.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets reiterated their proposal for reduction in military budgets but
                        we do not see any basis for a meaningful comparison between military
                        budgets. For example, our soldiers receive a base pay of $120, far in excess
                        of what a Soviet soldier receives.</p>
                    <p>With regard to disarmament, the Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was rather gloomy, saw little
                        prospect in the Geneva conference, and tended to blame us for lack of
                        progress. The Secretary said he had taken <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> up on this and had told him that the U.S. defense
                        increment since the last World War had increased by $500 billion as a result
                        of Soviet actions. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had not
                        contested this point. In general, the Soviets had studiously abstained from
                        any kind of ideological discussion and had adopted instead a practical
                        attitude. The only exception was that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had launched into an attack against the West German
                        regime and had claimed that our policy was being entrapped by West Germany.
                        The Secretary said he had made it plain to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that our interest in the German problem and in
                        Berlin was based on our own security.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, the Secretary mentioned a number of bilateral problems which were
                        being discussed with the Soviets, among them a consular agreement.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that in June the Soviets had suddenly stopped jamming
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts and had made an
                        announcement to this effect. <pb n="782" xml:id="pg_782" facs="0810"/>This
                        was a surprising move, probably related to some extent to Soviet-Chinese
                        differences. We were taking advantage of this by broadcasting information on
                        developments often well in advance of Soviet announcements. For example, we
                        had broadcast the President's offer for a joint expedition to the moon
                        before the Soviets had announced it. M. Couve de Murville speculated that
                        the Soviets were perhaps using all their jamming facilities against the
                        Chinese.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we were also interested in setting up a telex
                        communication line between our Embassy in Moscow and our Embassy in
                        Paris.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, there was the possibility of a civil air agreement which would
                        permit two weekly flights.</p>
                    <p>On wheat, there were indications that the Soviets might wish to buy up to 4
                        million tons from us. The President was now looking into this. There would
                        be certain advantages to such a sale. It would help our food problem, it
                        would help our balance-of-payments problem, and it would seem advantageous
                        to siphon off some of the Soviet foreign exchange in this manner. On the
                        other hand, there might be problems in Europe. M. Couve de Murville
                        interjected that there would be no problem as far as the French were
                        concerned. The Secretary referred to Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>'s recent statement on the subject. The Secretary
                        said that the Soviet interest in buying wheat was quite new. During the
                        signing of the test ban agreement in Moscow, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had shown no interest in buying consumers goods
                        on a large scale.</p>
                    <p>M. Couve de Murville said he would like to comment on some of the specific
                        points mentioned by the Secretary, but he would like to approach the problem
                        of East-West relations from a general point of view. Before doing so,
                        however, he wanted to comment briefly on the wheat agreement. From the
                        French point of view, there were no objections whatsoever to wheat sales,
                        which the French considered normal trade practice. France had been selling
                        some wheat to the Chinese Communists and limited amounts of flour to the
                        Soviets. Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>'s recent
                        position on wheat sales was new. Until now, he had opposed the sale of
                        strategic goods which could help the Soviet war potential. The Secretary
                        said that we have accepted this view with the result that our trade with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> amounts to $35 million whereas
                        European trade, and especially German trade, with the East is much higher.
                        Couve agreed. He then turned to the general problem of East-West
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>M. Couve de Murville said there was one fact and one development. There was
                        the Moscow agreement and there were the negotiations that may flow from
                        it.</p>
                    <p>The Moscow agreement was something specific. It was generally understood that
                        this is a US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> agreement which came
                        about because both sides wanted it. The agreement had been signed by a great
                        number <pb n="783" xml:id="pg_783" facs="0811"/>of states which had no
                        intention or no capability of developing nuclear forces. The agreement had
                        also been signed by Germany which, in 1954, had voluntarily agreed to
                        limitations going considerably beyond the terms of the Moscow agreement. On
                        the other hand, the treaty had not been signed by Communist China nor by
                        France. For reasons that were well known, France could not sign the
                        treaty.</p>
                    <p>Couve continued that the Moscow agreement, while not significant from a
                        military point of view, was important politically. The treaty was regarded
                        as a starter which could lead to agreements on other things. Indeed, both
                        sides had agreed to continue the talks and these talks, almost without
                        exception, concerned points on which the Soviets have always been, and
                        continue to remain, adamant. The Secretary said that non-dissemination was
                        an exception. Couve agreed but said that the Soviets continued to oppose the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>M. Couve de Murville said that these talks were making the Germans nervous.
                        For its part, the French Government could see no advantage in these
                        discussions. The French Government feared that the only result of these
                        talks would be to lead the Germans to question their relationship with the
                        West. Couve alluded to the earlier series of talks with the Soviets in the
                        first half of 1962 which the French had also considered useless and
                        dangerous in the sense that they could lead to a deterioration of the
                        political climate in Germany.</p>
                    <p>Couve de Murville said that France was, of course, no less desirous than the
                        United States in improving relations with the Soviets but felt that this
                        improvement should be sought by different means. He said that the Western
                        attitude toward the Soviets had on the whole been defensive. A true detente
                        could be achieved only if the Soviets refrained from threatening. For
                        example, as soon as the Soviets would make it clear with regard to Berlin
                        that they were no longer threatening access, the elements for a realistic
                        detente would exist.</p>
                    <p>M. Couve de Murville stressed that there were no substantive but only
                        procedural differences between the U.S. and the French on these talks with
                        the Soviets. He said that the French had never harbored any doubts about the
                        U.S. position and had never assumed that we would concede anything to the
                        Soviets in these talks. The mere fact that these talks were taking place
                        before the elements of a real détente were present could lead, however, to a
                        deterioration of the political climate in Europe.</p>
                    <p>Commenting on the Secretary's question why the Soviets continued to attack
                        the West German regime, M. Couve de Murville said that he believed the
                        Soviet concern about Germany was quite real. It was the result of the last
                        war when all parts of Eastern Europe and vast regions of the Soviet Union
                        had been occupied by the Germans. M. Couve de Murville said that this Soviet
                        concern with regard to Germany probably also explains Soviet opposition to
                        the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. The Secretary said that it was
                        possible <pb n="784" xml:id="pg_784" facs="0812"/>that the Soviets believe
                        what we are saying with regard to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                        but that they think that we are wrong. Couve agreed and reiterated his
                        belief that Soviet concern about Germany was real.</p>

                    <p>In a memorandum to Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, October 8, 1963, Joseph Carroll, Director of the
                        Defense Intelligence Agency, reported that an assessment of Soviet military
                        personnel in Cuba, prepared in collaboration with the Central Intelligence
                        Agency, concluded that “Soviet military personnel withdrawals are continuing
                        and that total Soviet military strength in Cuba is now estimated to be
                        between 5,000 and 8,000—representing a reduction to date of at least
                        two-thirds of the number originally estimated to be on the island during the
                        crisis. Most of those remaining are advisors and technicians engaged in
                        training Cuban personnel.” For text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v11">

                    <p>Two days later Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> assured President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> during their meeting in Washington that “there were now
                        no Soviet troops in Cuba. The Soviet personnel now in Cuba were specialists
                        training the Cubans in the use of arms supplied by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. When this limited task was accomplished
                        these would be withdrawn.” Upon being asked by <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                        “how many Soviet military specialists would remain in Cuba in, say, six
                        months,” <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that “he
                        preferred not to speak in terms of dates but he wished to ask the President
                        to understand that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had in Cuba
                        only military specialists with a limited mission.” For text of the

                        meeting on November 13, Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> reported that the Soviets were
                        “continuing a gradual withdrawal” but that “no military equipment has been

                    <p>The Secretary expressed gratification that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had come to Washington and that this discussion
                        could take place. He observed that there were several unfinished points to
                        be discussed and suggested that perhaps Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> could indicate which of them could be discussed
                        first.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> commented that the
                        Secretary and he had covered several questions in New York and that perhaps
                        it would be useful to continue the exchange of views on those questions. He
                        noted, however, that some points had been practically not dealt with in the
                        New York conversations. In this connection, he recalled that some time ago
                        the Secretary had mentioned the possibility of discussing commercial
                        relations between the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                        had indicated he might comment on this matter at a later point. He wondered
                        whether the Secretary could express his views on this problem now.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we were interested in taking up with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> the discussion of possibilities in the
                        trade field and of the problems necessarily involved with it. He thought Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had probably observed in
                        the press that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as a result of a
                        meeting held yesterday, had decided to re-examine the trade <pb n="786" xml:id="pg_786" facs="0814"/>policy with the Soviet Union and the other
                        socialist states. This was because the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
                        had a lively interest in the possibility of progress in this area. However,
                        the Secretary pointed out that the lend-lease problem, which had been with
                        us for some time, still existed and was related to the existing legislative
                        barriers, primarily those relating to commercial credits, etc. The Secretary
                        then recalled his remark in Moscow that we had some commercial practices in
                        connection with which difficulties might also arise, but said we would try
                        to deal with them as constructively as possible. In addition, there were
                        problems on such matters as copyright, patents and dumping, where
                        adjustments would be required on the Soviet side.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary continued that there were some inherent operational
                        difficulties in trade between a free competitive system like ours and a
                        highly organized and planned system such as that existing in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Nevertheless, he believed such
                        difficulties could be resolved, noting they appeared to have been resolved
                        in trade relations between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                        other “capitalist” countries. The Secretary thought while the Executive
                        Branch was dealing with Congress on these matters, perhaps quiet discussion
                        between the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could be initiated
                        either in Washington or in Moscow to explore the problems which exist in the
                        field of trade. He then invited Under Secretary Ball to comment, noting Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> was an expert in
                        economics.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> observed that, as
                        distinct from European states, the US had not had the practice of bilateral
                        trade agreements. This would require much exploration, because we were not
                        familiar with that practice and there were a number of statutory and
                        constitutional problems involved here. However, he believed that the
                        problems the Secretary had referred to were soluble. One problem which he
                        thought would cause trouble was that of most-favored-nation treatment, i.e.,
                        the problem of tariff legislation, but even that depended on the type of
                        commodity. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> continued that
                        these matters could be developed only when we proceeded further in our
                        discussions, if it was decided to have such discussions. He believed there
                        were possibilities for an expansion of trade between the two countries and
                        that an exploration of these possibilities would be profitable to both
                        sides.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary pointed out that after coming back from Moscow he had taken
                        administrative action, where possible, to ease trade between our two
                        countries, and noted that he would not have taken such action before his
                        trip to Moscow. The action he referred to applied primarily to the granting
                        of export licenses. He then inquired what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s views were regarding the possibility of exploring,
                        either in Washington or in Moscow, the problem under discussion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> wondered whether it was
                        correct to understand that the US was considering changes, to the extent
                        this was possible, both in <pb n="787" xml:id="pg_787" facs="0815"/>legislation and in operational procedures. As to the former, he commented
                        that the form would not be important; e.g., the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might not be mentioned by name. As to the latter, he said
                        he understood that this aspect might be easier to change.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s last remark, but pointed out that this would be true
                        only if such changes did not challenge Congressional policy.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> commented that
                        from the standpoint of procedure it might perhaps be easier first to see
                        what could be done within the existing legislative framework and only then
                        to turn to the broader problem of legislation.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted other “socialist” countries had approached us on matters
                        of trade. As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> knew, one of
                        the difficulties here was the existence of unsettled financial obligations
                        on the part of those countries, but we had reached agreement with Bulgaria
                        and Czechoslovakia so that this should not be a problem. The most immediate
                        problem was that of most-favored-nation treatment, particularly in the case
                        of Yugoslavia and Poland. Although such treatment might perhaps be granted
                        by Congress to Yugoslavia this year, the Secretary doubted that it would be
                        granted to Poland because there was a great deal of unhappiness in Congress,
                        as well as in the Executive Branch, about the attitude of the Polish
                        Representative on the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> in Laos. In this
                        connection, the Secretary observed that, while these two matters were
                        perhaps objectively unrelated, one should recognize that there was a
                        relationship here. The Secretary agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> that we should first concentrate on what could be done
                        within the existing legislative framework, pointing out that it would be
                        most undesirable to make an early effort on such matters as the
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> Act and experience a failure.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he wished to
                        emphasize once again what had been said earlier by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> at the highest level, namely, that
                        discriminatory practices created difficulties for improving relations
                        between our two countries in the broadest sense of that term. It was for
                        this reason that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> believed that it
                        would be better to have those practices abolished. If the United States, and
                        the President personally, believed that some action would be ripe for
                        execution eventually, such action would be a major step in improving our
                        relations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he had
                        understood the Secretary to say that such eventual action would embrace both
                        the general US trade policy and the operation practices by which US
                        companies were guided in trade with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, or, more correctly, in the absence of such trade. He said
                        he was pleased to hear this and reiterated that this would be good from the
                        broad standpoint of US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations; this
                        would be in the interest of both the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as well as the world at large, and neither side would gain
                        any unilateral advantage. As to how and when these matters could be
                        discussed between our two <pb n="788" xml:id="pg_788" facs="0816"/>countries, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> felt either
                        Moscow or Washington would be practical, but noted that he wished to consult
                        with his Government and would give a reply in a few days. In any event, he
                        believed that if the US was prepared to discuss these matters in the
                        immediate future there would be no procrastination on the part of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary commented that from our standpoint it would be more convenient,
                        at least in the early stages, to have those discussions in Washington,
                        because of our need to be in touch with Congress and the Department of
                        Commerce. He noted, however, that this was not a hard position, but simply a
                        matter of convenience from our standpoint.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would take into account the Secretary's
                        remark. Referring to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s
                        comments, he wondered whether he had understood correctly that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> foresaw some difficulties in having a
                        formal agreement.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> commented this
                        pattern was different from the one we had been using, but perhaps it was
                        possible. In any event, he did not rule it out.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        whether Soviet trade arrangements with Western Europe were based on
                        bilateral trade agreements.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied in the affirmative
                        and said this was the usual pattern.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> whether
                        the US had bilateral trade agreements with anyone.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary replied that as Europe had moved from the situation
                        existing immediately after the war, where there had been a shortage of
                        foreign currency to a situation of free convertibility of currency and of
                        free trade, our trade with Western Europe was based on multilateral
                        agreements. However, European countries had had experience in bilateral
                        arrangements. As to the US, we would need some adjustment in our
                        practices.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then said that our two countries would have to find products
                        they could buy from each other, because apparently our trade would be
                        bilateral. The problem was that our two countries produced similar things,
                        and therefore we would have to explore this matter and try to find an
                        economic basis. In this connection, he noted there was now a surplus of US
                        tourist exchange going to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; if that
                        surplus continued, it would enable the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        to buy more on the US market.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he wished to remind
                        the US side that the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had
                        had a trade agreement before the war. He believed that the situation
                        obtaining at that time had justified such an agreement, but then the war
                        came and things changed completely.</p>
                    <p>He then said he wished to take up some of the points the Secretary had
                        raised. In particular, he wondered whether the US had thought about the
                        problem of credits, and also what relation the US saw between <pb n="789" xml:id="pg_789" facs="0817"/>the problem of lend-lease and US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> trade relations. As to the latter point,
                        he recalled that three or four years ago, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> had stated the Soviet view on this matter, but noted
                        that practically no discussion of the problem had taken place since
                        then.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary commented that the latest attempt to resolve this problem had
                        failed because the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had wished to
                        discuss at the same time the problems of trade and credits. He pointed out
                        that the problem of lend-lease was involved in our legislation so that it
                        would have to be resolved.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary commented that lend-lease was related to credits. There
                        were two problems as regard credits: 1) there was the
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> Act which provided that no loans could be
                        granted before lend-lease was settled and 2) there was the question of
                        definition of credits, because if credits were on such a long-term basis
                        that this would make it look like assistance, this would create
                        difficulties. The position we took on wheat was to interpret the
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> Act as not applicable to normal commercial
                        payments, but we could not apply this interpretation to such things as
                        machinery, etc.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary commented this meant that we could not extend credits as they
                        had been extended by some West European countries, without amending the
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> Act.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary agreed that we could not unless lend-lease was
                        settled.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he wished to
                        emphasize that his remarks were only exploratory and should not be
                        understood as an application for loans.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he understood that and stated we were prepared to examine
                        these problems in all of their aspects if the development of our relations
                        continued as we hoped it would. He then expressed the view that it was
                        unfortunate that the cold war period following the last war had interfered
                        with the classic concept of trade, namely, that trade should benefit both
                        sides. In this connection, he recalled that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had endorsed this concept. The Secretary
                        regretted that there had been developments during the post war period which
                        had distorted this classic concept.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> believed it would be best
                        if the entire problem were resolved. However, he thought that if the two
                        sides should be unable to agree on some of its aspects, e.g., on such a
                        matter as lend-lease, which strictly speaking was not part of the trade
                        problem anyway, lack of agreement on such aspects should not hamper the
                        development of other aspects of trade relations between our two countries.
                        He did not believe there should be a tight package.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary commented that he could agree with this in theory, but noted
                        that the problem must be examined.</p>
                    <pb n="790" xml:id="pg_790" facs="0818"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> wondered what the
                        Secretary's views were in terms of time, i.e., when legislative and
                        operational changes could be expected.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that one thing was certain: no change could be expected
                        during this session of Congress. Congress was swamped with legislation this
                        year, and anybody suggesting additional new legislation would have a very
                        hard time. In any event, we were not ready yet politically and consequently
                        we would have many months to examine all these problems.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary expressed the view that we should see what steps or
                        progressive adjustments could be brought about, noting this could facilitate
                        change in legislation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> wondered whether the
                        Secretary could comment on the second part of his question.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that the US had kept these matters under review; there
                        had been some movement on them, and perhaps further movement was possible.
                        He noted that this depended on individual items and that the Secretary of
                        Commerce and he were frequently consulting on these matters. While he
                        believed further movement was possible, he felt that it would be misleading
                        to make a generalized statement. In this connection, he thought Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> must have seen
                        statements by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName> and
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> which had a bearing
                        on this matter. While he himself had not said much on this subject, he
                        believed that fresh possibilities existed in this area.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the President of
                        Amtorg in New York had told him about inquiries on the part of US companies
                        regarding trade with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, but
                        apparently those inquiries had not resulted in anything. He thought perhaps
                        those matters were under consideration in the Administration, because the
                        components were apparently inquiring in terms of future possibilities rather
                        than immediate transactions.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> interjected that
                        two or three cases, including textiles, had been resolved favorably.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then inquired whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> dealt with trade matters a great deal.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied in the negative
                        but noted that the Ministry of Foreign Trade was headed by his former
                        deputy, Mr. Patolichev, so that the Foreign Ministry was familiar with the
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then stressed the psychological value for trade of movement by
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on such matters as copyright. In
                        this connection, he noted that some “socialist” states had agreed to certain
                        arrangements in this field; indeed, Bulgaria had accepted the International

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> facetiously remarked that
                        the Secretary had probably raised this point in order to knock him out,
                        because he knew nothing about the subject. He acknowledged that this point
                        had been raised with <pb n="791" xml:id="pg_791" facs="0819"/>the Soviet
                        Union on several occasions and observed that Soviet organizations dealing
                        with the matter were not particularly enthusiastic about it. He thought the
                        matter would probably be discussed again, but said he did not know what
                        would come out.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary observed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would surely agree that there were some points
                        which, while not of great practical importance, were significant from a
                        psychological standpoint.</p>
                    <p>At this point the Secretary invited the group to join him for lunch where the
                        discussion could be continued.<note n="3" xml:id="d362fn3">No record of the

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he wished to raise
                        the matter of broad relations between the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He thought the Secretary and himself
                        were in agreement that our two countries occupied a position in the world
                        which was decisive in determining, in the long run, whether or not there
                        would be agreement on any important problem in the world. He recalled that
                        the President had expressed a similar thought during last year's
                            conversation.<note n="2" xml:id="d363fn2">See <ref target="#d253">Document 253</ref>.</note> He had reported this to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and the latter believed that
                        this was a reasonable view. If this were to be personified, he believed that
                        understanding between the President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was most important for the world. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was familiar with the President's speech
                        on June 10 at the American University.<note n="3" xml:id="d363fn3">See <ref target="#d328">Document 328</ref>.</note> He believed the President
                        was aware of the assessment his statements, including the one at the
                        American University, had been given in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The President's statements had been received positively
                        in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, both by the Soviet Government
                        as a whole and by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in
                        particular. This was a definite and deliberate line in the Soviet policy
                        vis-à-vis the US. If the US took the same line, then there was reason for an
                        optimistic assessment of the prospects for the development of our relations.
                        What the Soviet Union wanted to do was to give this a concrete form. Perhaps
                        this was not new to the President, because all messages from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> were in this spirit. If this
                        line was followed with determination then such synthetic (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>) problems as disarmament, Germany, etc., could be resolved
                        much more easily than in a situation where the two sides quarreled.</p>
                    <p>The President said he appreciated Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s remarks. The US attempted to carry out the policy
                        enunciated in the American University speech. As he had stated in his press
                        conference yesterday,<note n="4" xml:id="d363fn4">For a transcript of the
                            President's press conference on October 9, at which he had announced
                            that the U.S. Government would not prohibit grain sales to the Soviet
                            Union, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the
                                United States: <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">John F.
                                    Kennedy</persName>, 1963,</hi> pp. 767-775.</note> there were
                        areas of disagreement between our two countries, but he felt it was up to
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and him to do
                        everything possible to prevent us from colliding. There were such questions
                        as, for example, Laos where we hoped the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would exert its influence to prevent the situation from
                        collapsing. Another matter of concern to us was of course Cuba. It was <pb n="793" xml:id="pg_793" facs="0821"/>helpful that Soviet troops had been
                        leaving, because this lessened the international importance of that problem.
                        As had been stated before, the United States had no intention of invading
                        Cuba. As to Germany, the President saw no reason why the situation there
                        should be incendiary. He stressed incidents should be avoided in the
                        corridors because they created unnecessary nuisance and irritation.
                        Reverting to the American University speech, the President said it had been
                        addressed more to the U.S. audience than to the Soviet, but we had tried to
                        carry out that policy.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then noted the Secretary
                        and he had had earlier today a discussion on US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> trade relations.<note n="2" xml:id="d364fn2">
                            <ref target="#d362">Document 362</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The President said we ought to give important study to this problem, noting
                        that this could be useful particularly now that the wheat deal had been
                        made. Perhaps chances for improvement in this area were now <pb n="794" xml:id="pg_794" facs="0822"/>better than before. The President then
                        asked the Secretary where this matter had been left with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary reported on his earlier conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, noting that there were a number of
                        problems, including operational, legislative, economic, and of course
                        lend-lease.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired what the status of lend-lease was.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said that in last
                        discussions the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had offered to pay
                        $300 million whereas the US wanted $800 million. This was apart from the 47
                        ships which the US had given to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that the US had been looking at the problem of trade
                        since the Moscow meeting, and that both sides should keep at it.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then commented that as far as the US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> air agreement was concerned, the US thought technical
                        discussions could be initiated looking forward to signing the agreement
                        toward the end of the year. Those discussions were contemplated in the
                        agreement but could be undertaken even before the actual signing. The FAA
                        could discuss with its Soviet counterpart the operational rules and airport
                        facilities, and our respective airlines could also discuss matters of
                        concern to them. The Secretary commented that, frankly speaking, if there
                        were headlines in the press tomorrow about the holding up of our Berlin

                    <p>On October 10, 1963, Soviet forces detained a U.S. convoy of 18 military
                        vehicles at the Marienborn and later the Babelsberg checkpoints in the
                        German Democratic Republic. Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> told Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> in a meeting in Washington the next day that the
                        action had been a “unilateral attempt by the Soviets to change
                        well-established procedures” that set back “all the efforts we have been
                        making to solve issues between us.” For text of the Department's report of
                        the meeting in telegram 1155 to Moscow, October 11, see <ref target="frus1961-63v15">

                    <p>In a meeting with his senior advisers on October 11, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> decided on a course of action which
                        included urging France and the United Kingdom to participate in assembling
                        Free Style forces (a platoon-sized force to probe Soviet intentions on
                        access) and in delivery of a <pb n="795" xml:id="pg_795" facs="0823"/>tripartite protest note to the Soviets. For text of the record of action,
                        see ibid., page 600. That afternoon Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> reported to the Department of State in telegram 1223
                        that he had met with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>, who argued that the Soviets had
                        instituted no new procedures; rather, U.S. troops had refused to comply with
                        established procedures. <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>
                        “stressed that <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> side had no intention
                        create difficulties and that if this true of US side, all would be well.”
                        Later the same day, <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> met again with his advisers
                        and decided that assembly of Free Style forces should begin but appeared to
                        take a wait-and-see stance on further action. For text of telegram 1223 and

                        601-604.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador at Large <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> in Washington, <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> in Moscow, and Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> held further discussions by telephone on October 11 and
                        12, with the Soviets arguing that the U.S. convoy had violated established
                        procedures, while U.S. officials protested alleged Soviet violations. For
                        records of their conversations, see ibid., pages 605-609. The convoy was
                        allowed to proceed on October 12 without further incident.</p>
                    <p>In telegram Topol 481 to the U.S. Mission to the North Atlantic Treaty
                        Organization, October 15, the Department expressed the opinion that the
                        delay of the convoys did not mark a shift of Soviet policy “with respect
                        Soviet efforts to secure general easing of international tensions.” The
                        telegram continued, “we believe <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> did
                        not intend to bring about major confrontation last week, and train events
                        may have been set in motion by no higher ranking a person than Marienborn
                        checkpoint commander,” who in turn was supported by higher level Soviet
                        authorities who may not have been fully informed concerning U.S. convoy
                        procedures. This interpretation, however, did not “absolve Moscow from
                        responsibility for continuing Soviet efforts to erode Western rights in
                        Berlin and on access routes.” For text, see ibid., pages 610-611. The
                        President, in a meeting October 21 with key advisers, decided that the
                        Soviet Union should be informed of U.S. convoy procedures and that the
                        procedures “should be passed to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> to give the Soviet political leadership rather than
                        the military authorities control of the matter from the start.” A text of
                        the memorandum for the record is ibid., page 615.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Following a brief exchange of pleasantries with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName>, Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> suggested that this be considered a
                        working luncheon in order to discuss questions of mutual interest to both
                        sides. He stated that the President had approved licensing of wheat exports
                        to the Soviet Union provided that certain conditions were met. In a press
                        release, four main aspects of the wheat export deal were mentioned: (1)
                        price, (2) terms of payment, (3) shipment, and (4) allocation as between
                        private grain dealers. The matter of use was also of concern to the United
                        States. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stated that
                        Secretary of Agriculture Freeman would be able to discuss questions of price
                        and Secretary of Commerce <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName>
                        questions of shipment with the Soviet Delegation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> stated that in the Soviet
                        Union there were really two foreign trade organizations, first, the Ministry
                        of Foreign Trade and secondly, the State Committee of the Council of Foreign
                        Ministers on Foreign Economic Relations. (At this point Mr. Manjulo
                        interjected to the effect that there was a saying that while the Ministry
                        made money, the Committee gave it away.) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we did not have in this country an organization
                        similar to theirs. We do not have a Ministry of Foreign Trade; matters
                        pertaining to export of agricultural commodities are subject to the
                        Department of Agriculture, questions of shipping to the Department of
                        Commerce.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> stated there were certain
                        general and specific questions that arose. In a recent wheat deal with
                        Canada similar questions were raised and were resolved very quickly and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> wanted to ask whether
                        they could reach agreement on a basis similar to the Canadian deal. The
                        “technology” of the Canadian deal was worked out by Mr. Sharp of the
                        Canadian Ministry of Trade by means of an exchange of letters between
                        Canadian and Soviet Ministries through the Wheat Board of Canada. The deal
                        concerned not only wheat but also flour. On the basis of this exchange of
                        letters the Soviet trade organization “Exportkhleb” concluded a general
                        agreement with the Canadian Wheat Board. This <pb n="797" xml:id="pg_797" facs="0825"/>general agreement covered the main points as to period of
                        delivery, quantity, quality and also contained other provisions along the
                        lines of the London contract or Winnipeg contract depending upon ports of
                        shipment. The terms of payment that were worked out with the Canadians were
                        F.O.B. Canadian ports, 25% cash down and then 25% every 6 months for a total
                        period of 18 months, with a provision, however, that the total indebtedness
                        at any time was not to exceed $200,000,000. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> stated that they had not used the privilege given
                        them as to terms of payment because they considered the rates of interest
                        charged them for the credit to be excessive. He said, “we are not poor but
                        as good businessmen we simply did not want to pay additional expense of
                        interest.” (Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName>
                        interjected that this was a very sound capitalist attitude to the problem.)
                        Following the conclusion of the agreement with the Canadian Wheat Board,
                        Exportkhleb then entered into specific contracts with companies such as
                        Dreyfus, Bunge, Continental and others.</p>
                    <p>The first general question then which arises is whether the Soviets could
                        work out a similar technology of the deal with the United States. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thereupon stated that the
                        U.S. considered it to be more practical to follow their usual procedures of
                        trade, government participation in it being limited to the granting of
                        export licenses while the actual agreements were to be worked out with
                        individual grain dealers. The U.S. conducts an annual export trade of
                        800,000,000 bushels on that basis and would prefer to follow this method
                        rather than develop a new procedure. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> asked whether the granting of licenses represented a
                        guarantee of delivery of the quantities contracted for. The answer to that
                        was given by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> who
                        stated, no, the export licenses were not guarantees in any form, that
                        contracts would have to be concluded with private companies, who would
                        obligate themselves in accordance with normal international trade practice
                        to deliver at a certain time at a certain price to a specific port. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> then said that here,
                        then, was a problem which came up on their very first day in Washington.
                        They did not have any normal international trade practice with the U.S.;
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> said this might be
                        the beginning of setting up such a practice.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> then stated that a second
                        general problem came up with reference to the question of price. In the case
                        of the Canadian wheat deal the matter of price had already been negotiated
                        with the Wheat Board of Canada and did not have to be negotiated with each
                        individual supplier. The only thing that was negotiated with such suppliers
                        was the amount of their commissions. Could such an arrangement be worked out
                        here? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> said that
                        this would not be possible in accordance with normal trade practice in the
                        U.S.; that we did not have any organization similar to the Canadian Wheat
                        Board and that we would prefer not to enter upon any
                        government-to-government deals on matters of price and other terms of the
                        wheat deal.</p>
                    <pb n="798" xml:id="pg_798" facs="0826"/>
                    <p>A discussion followed on the question of whether the very existence of the
                        sizable Soviet demand would affect the world price of wheat. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> thought that speculators would take
                        advantage of this situation and in his view, therefore, the most desirable
                        thing would be in a fixing of the price. At Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>'s suggestion, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> pointed out that at the present
                        time there were more than 1,100,000,000 bushels of wheat in storage in
                        warehouses of the Commodity Credit Corporation, a government agency, and
                        that such a speculation could not really take place since the government
                        would make available to the grain market an amount of wheat corresponding to
                        the quantity sold to the Soviets. Mr. Freeman also pointed out that by
                        dealing directly with American grain dealers the Soviets would have the
                        advantage of competition among the dealers and thereby would be able to
                        obtain the best possible price in relation to the world price of wheat. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> said there was really no
                        such thing as a world price of wheat, that there were only prices in a given
                        market and therefore the Soviets, in addition to their other difficulties,
                        would be faced with the choice of markets to buy in. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> added to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>'s remarks by pointing out that
                        the large quantity of wheat held by the Commodity Credit Corporation in
                        itself represented, first, a guarantee of an adequate supply of wheat, far
                        in excess of any quantity that had so far been mentioned and second, that,
                        in a way, it represented a guarantee against upward fluctuation in the price
                        of wheat. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> temporarily
                        ended the discussion of the matter of price by saying that this was a
                        question that certainly called for additional discussion, that this matter
                        should not be permitted to “drift.” By that he did not necessarily have in
                        mind a written agreement, rather something in the nature of a gentlemen's
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> next brought up the
                        question of freight rates. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName> said that one of the conditions of the President's
                        approval of the wheat deal was the provision that the wheat be carried on
                        American ships to the extent that such ships were available at the time. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName> further said that
                        undoubtedly the Soviet Government knew that freight rates for U.S. shipping
                        to Black Sea ports were some 3 to 4 dollars per ton higher than competitive
                        freight rates in ships of foreign registry. He pointed out, however, that
                        the Department of Commerce had set a ceiling on the freight rates to be
                        charged for shipping wheat to the Soviet Union, that the setting of such
                        ceiling had not as yet been publicly announced, but that the ceiling was
                        still several dollars per ton higher than competitive freight rates of
                        foreign carriers. In recent months foreign rates too had been gradually
                        rising. He said the Soviets would have to deal with two types of U.S.
                        carriers in this matter: first, small companies subsidized by the U.S.
                        Government; to a much larger extent however with large U.S. carriers who
                        were not subsidized, whose freight rates were still above competitive
                        foreign freight rates.</p>
                    <pb n="799" xml:id="pg_799" facs="0827"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> said that the Soviets were
                        not at all against American ships being used for the purpose of carrying the
                        wheat but that they had no intention to pay anyone for “their blue eyes”.
                        (Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> pointed out that
                        his eyes were brown.) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName>
                        further pointed out that his Ministry had recently purchased 9-1/2 million
                        tons of wheat and that he had fully covered himself with provision for the
                        tonnage necessary to carry this amount. Even prior to concluding the deal
                        with Canada he had contracted for 60 vessels on a time charter basis,
                        vessels of a capacity of 10 to 32,000 tons. In addition, Soviet ships were
                        standing by to provide additional carrying capacity. Therefore, while the
                        freight rates may be high, actually there was no business conducted on the
                        basis of such rates. He suggested that the U.S. sell wheat to the Soviet
                        Union on a F.O.B. basis; in such a case he would then ask for the right of
                        Soviet vessels to call at American ports. This way any difficulty could be
                        overcome. He also pointed out that just during the last 4 days freight rates
                        from St. Lawrence ports to the Black Sea had dropped by 3 to 4 dollars per
                        ton and were in the neighborhood of $9 a ton. This, then, too, was a general
                        question which required further discussion and solution. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> brought up the matter of American
                        ships sailing under so-called flags of convenience, for example, under the
                        flags of Panama and Liberia. He said everyone knew this to be an extensive
                        practice of American ship owners. Could such ships, not subject to high
                        American freight rates, be used to carry the wheat to Soviet Baltic and
                        Black Sea ports? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName>
                        answered that this was a possibility which would certainly have to be looked
                        into.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> asked that the total quantity
                        of wheat the Soviets were interested in be clarified. He said that initially
                        a figure of 4,000,000 tons had been mentioned, that later that figure had
                        been reduced to 2-1/2 million tons. Was he right in assuming that the
                        negotiations at this time were concerned with 2-1/2 million tons? Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> said he was certain that
                        there would not be any need for future purchases of wheat since the present
                        requirement had been brought about by a disastrous harvest in the Soviet
                        Union which would not be repeated. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> said that the first figure had included the
                        requirements of other socialist countries; however, since the President of
                        the U.S. had declared that there would be no difficulty in supplying wheat
                        to these other socialist countries directly, the figure was therefore
                        revised to 2-1/2 million tons which represented the requirements of the
                        Soviet Union. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> thought
                        that trade representatives of Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia were
                        already in the U.S. for the purpose of negotiating such purchases. Under
                        Secretary Murphy asked whether this figure would include grain and flour or
                        whether it was to be restricted to grain only. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> answered that the requirement was
                        for grain only unless of course the U.S. were willing <pb n="800" xml:id="pg_800" facs="0828"/>to sell flour to the Soviets for delivery
                        to Cuba. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> and Under
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> answered this question
                        in the negative.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName>, in summing up the
                        discussion so far, gave his opinion that when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> opened direct negotiations with
                        private grain dealers, the practical problems he had raised as to price,
                        quantity and shipping might very well resolve themselves, that such private
                        grain traders, driven by competition among themselves, would be far more
                        efficient in negotiating and handling wheat deliveries than the government
                        could hope to be. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName>
                        answered that he would not participate in any direct negotiations with
                        private American grain dealers, that that was the function of Exportkhleb.
                        Their negotiators, now in Canada, were headed by a Mr. Matveyev, that he
                        would call them to Washington while he was still here, and that he would
                        appreciate the State Department's instructing its Embassy in Ottawa to issue
                        the necessary visas to that Delegation. He mentioned that one of the members
                        of the delegation, “the most important member”, was a lawyer without whose
                        say-so nothing could be accomplished.</p>
                    <p>This led to a few caustic remarks about lawyers in general on the part of Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName>, and to an anecdote
                        concerning Peter the Great and lawyers by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>.</p>
                    <p>With reference to the financial problems arising as a result of such large
                        sales to the Soviet Union, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                        stated that he thought American private dealers might be faced with some
                        difficulty in attempting to negotiate temporary financing or in attempting
                        to discount papers with commercial banks, unless it was implied that the
                        U.S. Government would guarantee payment to such commercial banks. The
                        Export-Import Bank, a U.S. Government agency, would best be able to render
                        such guarantees if, in its turn, it could have the guarantee of the Soviet
                        Government in some form that payment would be made as agreed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> stated that the Soviet Government
                        could not guarantee such payments, that this would be handled by Soviet
                        banking organizations; he was careful to make a distinction between the
                        government-owned Soviet banks and the Soviet Government itself. It was
                        pointed out again, however, that such matters would best be negotiated
                        directly between the Soviet banks and the Export-Import Bank.</p>
                    <p>Replying to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s question as to
                        the use of the wheat, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName>
                        stated that all of the wheat would be used in the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that the
                        American press had evidenced a great deal of interest in the wheat
                        negotiations and he wondered whether he and the Soviet Delegation could
                        agree as to what was to be said to the press at this point. Of course, the
                        Soviets could say anything they wished. As for himself, he would merely say
                        that a useful initial meeting had taken place, reviewing the questions to be
                        discussed in detailed negotiations <pb n="801" xml:id="pg_801" facs="0829"/>during the next 2 or 3 days, without, however, going into details. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> agreed.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName>, in conclusion, said
                        that the next step would seem to be for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName>'s designees to begin negotiating the individual
                        contracts with private concerns, and, as any problems arose which the U.S.
                        Government could help resolve, then to turn to his Department and to
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName>' Department for that
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName> also stated that in
                        negotiating for freight Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName>
                        might find the problem to be less than it appeared at present. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> asked whether an export license
                        would cover the entire period of grain shipments. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName> replied that the license would cover
                        the entire period provided that the criteria initially set up by the
                        President had been met. He mentioned in passing that just this morning an
                        export license had been granted for the shipment of corn to Hungary. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> confirmed that the State
                        Department would act as a coordinator directing the Soviet negotiators to
                        the competent persons with whom specific problems were to be discussed.<note n="2" xml:id="d366fn2">At a second meeting on October 30 <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> reported that his discussions
                            with major U.S. grain traders had not produced any offers as the
                            question of ocean freight could not be resolved and the dealers had been
                            reluctant to commit themselves to specific prices without definite
                            assurances that the sale would be made. (Memorandum of conversation;
                            ibid.) At the third meeting on November 1 the two sides discussed
                            further the higher cost of shipping grain in U.S. bottoms, and the
                            Soviet delegation undertook to consider shipping 50 percent of the grain
                            in them. (Memorandum of conversation; ibid.)</note>

                    <p>Moscow is marking time on the Berlin autobahn issue and has given no
                        indication as to how it would react to any joint Allied statement on
                        existing access control procedures.</p>
                    <p>Since the detention of the British convoy on 16 October, the Allies have not
                        sent any convoys in or out of West Berlin to which the Soviets could apply
                        their new checking procedures. Last week, the Soviet checkpoint commander
                        claimed that passengers in all convoys of five vehicles or more must
                        dismount for head-counts. Following the perfunctory propaganda treatment of
                        the 10-12 October US Berlin convoy incident, both Soviet and East German
                        press media have ignored the subsequent British convoy incident.</p>
                    <p>Moscow appears anxious to avoid any impression that the autobahn incidents
                        imply a Soviet retreat from the détente atmosphere. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> gave wide publicity to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s statement that a Western
                        correspondent had distorted his remarks at Prestwich airport by applying his
                        pessimistic assessment of prospects for disarmament to the whole range of
                        issues covered in his recent talks with US and British leaders.<note n="2" xml:id="d367fn2">For text of the report in <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>, October 20, see <hi rend="italic">Current Digest of the

                    <p>The Soviet leaders, however, served notice that their desire to further the
                        East-West détente will not prevent a vigorous response to any Western moves
                        which, in their view, might alter the status quo, particularly in Germany. A

                        warned that renewed <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> discussions on

                        mutual understanding and trust.” It charged that steps to provide West
                        Germany with access to nuclear weapons “contradict the spirit” of the test
                        ban treaty. The statement repeated in notably restrained terms earlier

                    <p>On November 4, 1963, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> called in Soviet Charge Kornienko to protest Soviet
                        detention of another U.S. military convoy at the Marienborn checkpoint even
                        though the convoy had followed U.S. procedures, about which, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> noted, the Soviet Government had been
                        fully informed. In a discussion with Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on November 5, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> “expressed astonishment at Soviet
                        action,” but <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> “disclaimed any
                        knowledge of incident.” The convoy was released about the same time the
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> discussion occurred. For text of telegrams 1344 and

                    <p>In a meeting with U.S. businessmen in Moscow on November 6, Chairman
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> claimed that the
                        Unites States had yielded to Soviet procedures and intimated that the
                        incident might have led to nuclear war. For extracts from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s comments, see The New York

                        November 7, Ambassador to Germany <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> stated that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s comments made “unmistakably clear that Autobahn

                        that would permit retaliation by delaying transit of Soviet vessels through
                        the Panama Canal. The memorandum noted, however, that the Department of
                        State believed such a countermeasure had disadvantages, among them the fact
                        that “the action involved is so far removed from the autobahn that it might
                        be regarded by the Soviets as a sign of weakness.” For text, see ibid.,

                    <p>JFK: Have we changed from 50-50 to 20% to 30% as the papers say?</p>
                    <p>GWB: No, not at all. Even what we talked with the Trade about yesterday was
                        that we would get out some ground rules which would call for 50-50. Now if
                        they can't find 50% within the guidelines then of course, it may turn out to
                        be less than that.</p>
                    <p>JFK: I don't think it should look like we are doing—you know we have two
                        stories in the paper this morning. One that we are dropping that thing to
                        20-30% after I said it would go on American bottoms and the other that we
                        are giving this credit.</p>
                    <p>GWB: I feel just exactly as you do about it. The story that Bill Blair had in
                        the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> on Sunday—I got wind of it late Sunday
                        night from one of the wire services. I got a hold of Reston and he had Blair
                        call me and I put it up to Blair and he said he got it from the tops of one
                        of the Departments concerned or near the top and he is so near the top I
                        can't believe the story is wrong. I said, it is wrong and I wanted to deny
                        it. He said it had gone to bed in the first edition and I'll see if I can
                        get a denial in the second edition.</p>
                    <p>JFK: What was the story?</p>
                    <p>GWB: It was a fairly detailed story of all the preliminary planning we've
                        been doing and that's where the 20-30% business got into it. Somebody …</p>

                    <p>JFK: Leaked it out.</p>
                    <p>GWB: Yes. Blair covers both Agriculture and Commerce so it was one of those
                        places. He didn't come over here.</p>
                    <p>JFK: We don't want to be getting ourselves into more trouble than we need.
                        Before it drops from 50-50 I'd like to be …</p>
                    <p>GWB: We're not going to do a thing to drop it from 50-50. As far as the
                        Government's position is concerned, we are prepared to make a finding that
                        not more than 50% can be carried in American vessels but then the guidelines
                        are that up to 50% has to be carried in American vessels if they are
                        available.</p>
                    <p>JFK: Will somebody support us by showing that our finding about available
                        [ships] is not capricious?</p>
                    <p>GWB: Maritime claims they can document it completely.</p>
                    <p>JFK: We just don't have the ships.</p>
                    <p>GWB: The ships just don't exist because they are all occupied for the next
                        six months.</p>
                    <p>JFK: The other part is this story on the credit—that we've changed that—that
                        we've changed terms.</p>
                    <p>GWB: There's nothing in it. There is a lot of gossip going around in the
                        trade and of course in the Departments there has been a certain amount of
                        work going on. The Maritime Admin and the Agriculture Dept and people talk
                        so much.</p>
                    <p>JFK: How are you proceeding on it in any case?</p>
                    <p>GWB: We're not going to touch the Russians until the autobahn thing is
                        cleared up. They may come to see us today. The move is on their part now to
                        come back with some reaction to what we gave them on Friday. I don't think
                        we should be in communication at all with them until they get this thing
                        cleared up cause we might want to break this.</p>
                    <p>JFK: Fine</p>

                                366</ref>.</note> had been received by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> from his government.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> replied that he had
                        reported the proposal to his government but had not as yet received an
                        answer. The only additional information he had came from American
                        newspapers.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that since their last
                        conversation the other day, a number of possibilities had been explored.
                        There was no U.S. Government agency which would be in a position to handle
                        the wheat transaction in the manner proposed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName>. As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> undoubtedly knew, the grain export trade of the U.S.
                        was handled by four large companies primarily, and in this case, too, it
                        would be these four companies which would handle the bulk of the
                        transaction, since it was difficult for smaller companies to handle a deal
                        of this size. At the moment, the best way to proceed appeared to be for
                        private American grain trading companies to make their proposals to the
                        Soviet wheat delegation on a C &amp; F basis. The government had already
                        taken a number of steps, and intended to take some additional steps, in
                        order to make it easier for the companies involved to make acceptable
                        proposals to the Soviets on a C &amp; F basis. A part of the movement of
                        the wheat would still involve American vessels, but, since the offers to be
                        made would be on a C &amp; F basis, the freight would be a matter of
                        concern to the American company only. Furthermore, since freight constituted
                        only one element of their costs, competition among them for the volume the
                        Soviets were interested in would tend to bring the C &amp; F price down
                        to a basis acceptable to the Soviets. Thus, instead of our saying to them
                        that we proposed to sell them 2-1/2 million tons of wheat at a given price,
                        for delivery during a specified period of time, the matter would be handled
                        by private companies making individual C &amp; F offers for delivery to
                        Black Sea and Baltic ports.</p>
                    <pb n="807" xml:id="pg_807" facs="0835"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> asked a number of
                        questions to clarify the proposal. They were answered by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> by a restatement of the above
                        provisions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> added that there
                        was enough flexibility in this type of transaction for private grain dealers
                        to be prepared to absorb some of the elements of costs involved.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> asked whether his
                        understanding that the price would be uniform, regardless of which ships
                        would be used, was correct.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> answered that individual
                        grain dealers would approach the delegation with specific orders. Company A
                        might be higher than Company B. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> did not have to accept any offer which did not suit
                        him. To Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName>'s question as to
                        whether the type of ships used would make any difference in price, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stated that he wanted to be
                        clear about the fact that American vessels would be used along with vessels
                        of other countries, that if a company were to negotiate the sale of, say,
                        1/2 million tons, the price for that quantity would be uniform since
                        shipping costs would have been averaged out.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Manjulo asked whether the requirement that no company handled more than
                        25% of the total quantity involved, would still apply. This was answered by
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> in the affirmative.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> said that it would have
                        been better for him to deal with one firm only, but that he understood the
                        situation. He went on to say that he thought the American market was
                        somewhat different from that of other countries. In no other country did he
                        have to settle commercial matters with a State Department or Ministry of
                        Foreign Affairs. He thought that the State Department would have enough to
                        do with problems of its own without getting involved in commercial matters.
                        He wanted to clarify another question which pertained to Soviet ships.
                        Supposing that agreement had been reached on the transaction under
                        discussion, there would be other matters to be taken up as well, in which
                        the question of discrimination would inevitably be brought up. What did the
                        State Department intend to do about this problem?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that he had had at least
                        four telephone conversations with the Secretary of Labor since last talking
                        to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName>, and had expressed to
                        the Secretary the concern which the State Department felt in this
                            matter.<note n="3" xml:id="d370fn3">Memoranda of <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s telephone conversations with
                            Secretary of Labor Willard W. Wirtz are in the Kennedy Library, Ball
                            Papers, Telephone Conversations, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</note> Any suggestion about Soviet ships not being
                        handled in American ports was certainly not U.S. Government policy and this
                        matter would also be taken up with the heads of the unions involved. As he
                        had told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> the other day,
                        in this country unions were independent, and while he felt that some
                        progress would be achieved, the government could not give them instructions
                        in this matter.</p>
                    <pb n="808" xml:id="pg_808" facs="0836"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> remarked that
                        some of these unions had also discriminated against American owners of ships
                        sailing under flags of convenience. While the government would use its
                        influence to alleviate this situation, it was not in a position to guarantee
                        any specific results. At the present time there were four Canadian ships
                        which had been struck in Chicago.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> said that Soviet unions
                        also were not subject to direct control by the Soviet Government. However,
                        when necessary, their government did influence the unions to do that which
                        was considered desirable by the government. Whenever the government
                        sincerely desired to improve relations with a given country it took whatever
                        measures were necessary to smooth out any difficulties, and vice versa, if
                        they desired to worsen their relations with any given country, they took the
                        appropriate measures for that purpose. Since their unions were independent,
                        they, too, could create a problem by a policy of not handling ships of
                        American registry. He thought that in such an event Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> would lose no time in summoning the
                        Soviet Ambassador in order to register a resolute protest against such a
                        policy. Today's press again contained an article about Soviet ships with a
                        statement that they would be picketed if they attempted to load wheat in
                        this country. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> handed Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> a clipping from an American
                        newspaper.) In this connection the second question, then, was what would
                        happen if he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> should come
                        to terms, yet nothing could be accomplished because of such union
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> undoubtedly was aware of the fact
                        that in recent years there were a number of instances when unions had struck
                        rocket factories, nuclear plants, etc. yet the government found itself
                        helpless to remedy this situation completely. The government was unhappy
                        about the actions of some labor leaders but could not do much to improve the
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> said that rocket factories
                        and nuclear plants were, of course, internal matters, but, when unions began
                        to interfere with the conduct of international relations, then it seemed to
                        him that the State Department should be in a position to take action.
                        Continuing, he said that he would report the present proposal to his
                        government, and asked whether his understanding that the American firms were
                        ready to do business was correct. When answered that this was so, he said
                        that he would in that case detain the “Exportkhleb” negotiators whom he had
                        just instructed to return home. He asked whether anything should be put in
                        writing between the governments, perhaps something in the nature of an
                        exchange of letters.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> thought it would
                        be best for the present not to put anything in writing since the U.S.
                        Government would be dealing with the trade and so would Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> or his representative. He <pb n="809" xml:id="pg_809" facs="0837"/>thought it would be best not to
                        involve the government, as that might lead to a number of complications.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> said that in the Canadian
                        transaction, the Soviet Government had exchanged letters with the Canadian
                        Minister, Mr. Sharp. Mr. Sharp had stated in the letter that Canada was
                        prepared to sell a given quantity of wheat on specific terms. The Soviet
                        Ministry of Foreign Trade acknowledged the receipt of that letter and
                        signified its acceptance of the terms.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thought we could give a
                        letter to the Soviets to the effect that the U.S. Government was agreeable
                        to the sale of wheat by private grain traders to the Soviet Union in large
                        amounts, 2# million tons or more, and that the government would endeavor to
                        see to it that the grain would be made available.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> thought that in principle
                        this was satisfactory, but would like to have one point added, a statement
                        to the effect that the U.S. Government would, within the limits of its power
                        and authority, facilitate the consummation of the transaction. He did not
                        necessarily have the Department of State in mind for such a statement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> could give the necessary assurances
                        about grain being made available. The government would advise the trade of
                        the broad condition of offers to be submitted and would take the necessary
                        steps in order to facilitate the sale. As to delivery the government was not
                        really competent. This would have to be handled by the private grain trading
                        companies themselves.</p>
                    <p>(Mr. Manjulo brought up the matter of Soviet vessels again but was stopped by
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> who told him that this
                        should await further directives from Moscow.)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said it was his
                        frank view and opinion that the U.S. Government could influence the trade
                        unions better if it were not known that an agreement existed. If the unions
                        knew that agreement had been reached, they would undoubtedly create some
                        additional difficulties.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> said that he would of
                        course keep any such letter confidential.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> added that he would have to
                        consult with his associates as to exactly what kind of wording such a letter
                        should contain, particularly in view of the fact that other Departments were
                        involved.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> wanted to reiterate the
                        gist of the understanding. As he understood it then, first, private firms
                        would make offers to the Soviet wheat delegation on a C &amp; F basis;
                        second, the government would see to it that the grain would be available on
                        the market; third, that all possible assistance would be given to the
                        private firms in the execution of this transaction.</p>
                    <pb n="810" xml:id="pg_810" facs="0838"/>
                    <p>When this was confirmed, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName>
                        said he would so report to his government.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> added that he hoped quick
                        agreement could be reached because he and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> would otherwise be forced to
                        change some rather detailed plans they had made for their departure on
                        Friday afternoon.</p>
                    <p>Pending Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName>'s getting further
                        instructions from Moscow, it was agreed that another meeting be held at
                        10:00 a.m. Friday in order to discuss commodities other than wheat which had
                        been brought up at the first meeting.<note n="4" xml:id="d370fn4">At 5:20
                            p.m. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> called the President
                            and told him that the Soviet delegation seemed to like the U.S.
                            proposal. He made a similar call to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName>. (Memorandum of telephone
                            conversations; ibid.) At 11 a.m. November 7, the President convened an
                            advisory meeting, attended by <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName>,
                            to discuss the sale of wheat to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The discussion focused on rates, availablitity of
                            U.S. tankers, and other issues involved in shipping the wheat. A tape

                        from Moscow with reference to the previous meeting.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> answered that he had
                        received a directive to confirm the arrangements and that, therefore, now
                        practical business transactions could begin. He did have some minor items to
                        clarify, pertaining to the exchange of letters.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> had prepared a draft which he

                        hoped this matter could be completed prior to his departure this afternoon.

                            draft has not been found. The final text reads:</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>“In confirmation of the conversations we have had during the last few days,
                        the United States Government is prepared to prescribe licensing conditions
                        which will enable the United States grain trade to offer approximately 2-1/2
                        million tons of wheat for delivery to the Soviet Union on a CAF basis prior
                        to May 31, 1964.</p>
                    <p>“The appropriate Departments and Agencies of the United States Government are
                        prepared to take such steps as are within their competence to facilitate the
                        execution of these transactions. I should be glad of your confirmation that
                        the Soviet Union desires to purchase wheat of approximately this amount
                        provided it is available at reasonable prices in relation to the world
                        market.” (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>A copy of <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName>'s confirming letter,
                        also dated November 8, is attached to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s letter.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> said that on all principal
                        matters the letter was acceptable, but that he would like to have two minor
                        changes if possible, though he would not insist on them. Where the quantity
                        was stated to be 2-1/2 million tons he would prefer to have it read “2-1/2
                        million tons or more.”</p>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said that a definite
                        figure was used in order to be able to comply with the requirement that no
                        dealer handle more than one-fourth of the total quantity.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed to change the wording to read “approximately” 2-1/2 million
                        tons.</p>
                    <pb n="812" xml:id="pg_812" facs="0840"/>
                    <p>A second amendment requested by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> was an extension of the period of shipment to May 31
                        instead of April 30.</p>
                    <p>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> thought there might be some
                        conflict there with reference to the price support legislation which expired
                        May 15.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> mentioned that at one of
                        the previous meetings Mr. Roosevelt <note n="3" xml:id="d371fn3">Under
                            Secretary of Commerce, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr. </note> had proposed
                        extension of delivery time in order to get into the period of lower freight
                        rates. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> had consulted with
                        his foreign trade organization which had agreed to such a change.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thought this would be
                        agreeable.</p>
                    <p>As to the rest of the letter Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> asked permission to think it over, though in
                        principle it was “O.K.” He went on to say that inasmuch as the wheat
                        question had been resolved, trading firms should now be informed to that
                        effect. At the Embassy reception yesterday he had talked with
                        representatives of several firms who had had no further information beyond
                        the original directive.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that there remained
                        some details to be worked out between the government and private firms in
                        order to keep the price to a minimum. He had not wanted to give any further
                        advice to private trading firms until after having heard from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> this morning. These instructions
                        would now be released.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked how long
                        this might take and was answered by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> that this would be done very quickly and it was
                        agreed, therefore, that the wheat question could be considered to be
                        completed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> to comment on the broader
                        problems of trade between our two countries.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said that he
                        thought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> was familiar with
                        the principal problem pertaining to increased trade between the U.S. and
                        U.S.S.R. It was primarily a question of credit and was subject to the
                        provisions of Congressional legislation, such as the Johnson Act. This in
                        turn was related to the outstanding Lend-Lease balances. The last time that
                        a discussion had been held with Soviet representatives, two conditions for a
                        settlement of the Lend-Lease balances were laid down by the Soviet side:
                        first, the extension of government credit from the Government of the U.S. to
                        the Soviet Union and second, the conclusion of a trade agreement extending
                        most favored nation treatment to the Soviet Union. In view of the fact that
                        the U.S. Government, as such, was not in a position to extend long term
                        loans to other countries, we had never really been able to conclude
                        negotiations even though there was some indication that we could agree on
                        the amount of the outstanding Lend-Lease <pb n="813" xml:id="pg_813" facs="0841"/>balances. As to long term credit, the U.S. Government took
                        the position that this was a matter for private concerns to negotiate,
                        provided that the Lend-Lease matter had been settled. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> interjected that this, of course, did
                        not exclude the possibility of the government guaranteeing credit extended
                        by private firms to the Soviet trading organization. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> continued by asking whether Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> was prepared to discuss a
                        broader settlement of outstanding trade problems or whether he wanted to
                        deal with individual specific commodities.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> said that the Soviet Union
                        was ready to negotiate on the broader basis. The head of his government, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, had repeatedly said
                        this in many of his statements. He had emphasized that he was of the opinion
                        that the development of trade leads to the establishment of good relations
                        between countries and that, therefore, such trade should be encouraged. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> thought he really did not
                        need to say this, since all present knew this very well. He was sure they
                        also knew that the establishment of good relations between the Soviet Union
                        and the United States was a fundamental condition of world-wide peace. The
                        Soviet Union was therefore ready to negotiate on a very broad basis. In this
                        connection, a number of questions arose. One such question was whether the
                        U.S. was prepared to cease discriminatory treatment of Soviet commodities,
                        Soviet vessels in American ports and prohibition of certain trade
                        transactions.</p>
                    <p>Regardless of whether a trade agreement were concluded, such discrimination
                        would have to be discontinued, for, as long as it existed, it was difficult
                        to expand trade. Perhaps some of these discriminatory measures and practices
                        came about as a result of the Cuban situation, but he knew that there were
                        many reasonable people in the U.S. Government and that therefore ways and
                        means to do away with these practices could be found. He had meant to say
                        this in the way of a preamble.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> wanted Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> to know that from the point of view
                        of the U.S. Government we were dealing here with three distinct kinds of
                        problems: (1) Congressional legislation, (2) administrative regulations, and
                        (3) the unions' strong position with reference to Soviet shipping. With
                        reference to the first problem, there was no American legislation which
                        hindered expanded trade with the Soviet Union. As to the second type of
                        problem there were only some administrative regulations connected with
                        Public Law 480. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJ1">Chayes</persName> added
                        that there were also some regulations pertaining to port security and
                        inspection requirements.) The <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 program
                        merely stated that the U.S. Government could not charter ships of nations
                        engaged in trade with Cuba for <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 grain
                        shipments. But this only affected the U.S. Government itself, not private
                        companies. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJ1">Chayes</persName> introduced a
                        slight correction by recalling that there were certain legislative
                        provisions in the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> bill prohibiting
                        military or economic assistance to countries engaged in the Cuban <pb n="814" xml:id="pg_814" facs="0842"/>trade.) Thus, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> continued, we come to the problem
                        which we have discussed in previous meetings, namely, the unions' attitude
                        towards loading Soviet and other Eastern European vessels. We had two
                        distinct sets of longshoremens' unions in this country: the unions on the
                        Pacific Coast, whose leadership was quite independent of the East Coast and
                        Gulf Coast unions, did not adopt the same strong position towards Soviet and
                        Eastern European shipping, as did the latter. However, even with the East
                        Coast and Gulf unions, this attitude was only their position at this moment.
                        It did not mean that it was permanent and could not be altered. In the last
                        few days, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> had had several
                        conversations with the Secretary of Labor, who would try to persuade union
                        leadership to change their position. It should be understood, though, that
                        the Secretary of Labor was not always successful in his attempts at
                        persuasion. Thus, for example, persuasion had failed with reference to the
                        four Canadian vessels which had been struck in Chicago, and the government
                        was now seeking court injunctions to solve that problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thought that the shipping difficulties
                        could eventually be worked out if a broader trade agreement were
                        negotiated.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> pointed out that shipping
                        was only one of the problems. Supposing that the shipping problem had been
                        solved, there still remained the problem of a boycott of Soviet commodities.
                        American firms had been refused licenses for Soviet commodities, and even if
                        a firm succeeded in purchasing Soviet goods, it would still be handicapped.
                        As an example, he cited the fact that in order to import Soviet chromium ore
                        it had been necessary to obtain State Department assistance. He understood,
                        however, that the ore had been unloaded in an East Coast port where the
                        unions' attitude was particularly reactionary. The State Department had been
                        successful enough to influence the unions; about 150,000 tons of the ore had
                        been unloaded and paid for, and the transaction had been completed quite
                        normally. He therefore came to the conclusion that when the U.S. Government
                        was willing to exert its influence it could do so successfully.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that he would wish he
                        could share Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName>'s hopeful
                        attitude. In some cases the government could, by exerting great efforts,
                        achieve some success. In others again, it could not. But again, he wanted to
                        emphasize that this was the kind of problem which tended to disappear once
                        normal trade relations had been established.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> said that he had a
                        specific proposal to make and that was to negotiate either a renewal of the
                        old trade agreement which had been discontinued in 1947 or a new one, to be
                        negotiated in Moscow or Washington.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thought we would be
                        interested in exploring the possibilities of concluding a broad kind of
                        trade agreement.</p>
                    <pb n="815" xml:id="pg_815" facs="0843"/>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said he did not think
                        it would be useful to either side to be unrealistic as to the practical
                        problems of Congressional attitudes to any trade agreement with the Soviet
                        Union. Such Congressional attitude would be governed by overall relations
                        between the two countries. It was therefore necessary to take steps to
                        develop a climate which would tend to remove such obstacles. He did not
                        think it was possible to remove them in a single step.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> agreed that he did not
                        think it possible to settle all problems overnight. The question therefore,
                        was what initial steps the U.S. Government was prepared to take in order to
                        develop broader trade. For the Soviet side he could say that they were
                        prepared to place large orders in the U.S. His foreign trade organizations
                        were even now placing large orders for a variety of equipment in Western
                        European countries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> surely knew that
                        the Soviet Union was in the process of developing a chemical industry. For
                        the time being, they were primarily interested in chemical fertilizer
                        plants. They were prepared as a first step, to place an order for such a
                        plant in this country, but wanted to know what steps the U.S. Government
                        could take to facilitate such a transaction. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> thought this to be a realistic approach to the
                        problem of developing broader trade.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that we would be
                        interested in exploring such possibilities.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> continued to the effect
                        that if this were really possible, he would be prepared to conduct
                        negotiations for that purpose. He wanted to remind Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> that recently the two countries had
                        exchanged delegations of specialists for the purpose of studying trade
                        problems. The American delegation to the U.S.S.R. headed by Mr. Ernest Rubin
                        of the Department of Commerce had visited ports and other cities in the
                        Soviet Union and had met with many organizations. Their delegation, headed
                        by Mr. Alkhimov had been here. The delegation included the head of a
                        chemical fertilizer association, a Mr. Glintsev. He had sounded out American
                        firms with reference to the sale of a fertilizer plant. The firms had
                        appeared to be interested, but were unanimous in saying that they had not
                        had any directive from “above”. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> proposed to send another group of fertilizer plant
                        specialists if this appeared to be promising.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thought this would be the
                        best way to get started.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said that two
                        problems presented themselves in this connection. First, the question of
                        licensing would have to be discussed with other Departments. Second, and
                        more important, was the question of payment terms and credit and this was
                        precisely the area where we would encounter problems under the
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> Act. The <persName>Johnson</persName> Act,
                        however, only concerned long term credit but did not affect normal
                        commercial credit of 180 days or less.</p>
                    <pb n="816" xml:id="pg_816" facs="0844"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> said that in Europe and in
                        Japan the Soviet Union had obtained terms long enough to permit the setting
                        up and developing of production of such plants, that is 6 to 7 years.
                        Supposing that Mr. Glintsev were to come here for the purpose of starting
                        negotiations, and that we could come to terms on all questions including
                        technical, commercial and other questions, what measures would the U.S.
                        Government be prepared to take with reference to Soviet goods?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thought a suggestion from the
                        U.S.S.R. as to the type of commodities they would be prepared to offer to
                        the U.S. would be of interest.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> said that it was clear
                        that the question of boycott of Soviet goods would still have to be
                        resolved. Would licenses be granted so as not to boycott Soviet commodities?
                        As to the actual items of merchandise this would be up to the commercial
                        people such as Mr. Shershnev and others, and up to American purchasers.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that there were no
                        boycott provisions in any of the legislation of the U.S. The only legal
                        question to be decided was whether most favored nation terms could be
                        extended to the Soviet Union. To clarify, historically, following the
                        passing of the Tariff Act of 1932, a series of negotiations with various
                        countries had led to reciprocal agreements for the reduction of tariffs with
                        many Western European countries. The question of whether such most favored
                        nation treatment could be extended to trade between a country whose private
                        citizens conducted foreign trade and a country where foreign trade was
                        handled on a state basis was something that had to be considered. Congress
                        had repeatedly taken the position that countries with whom over the years
                        negotiations which had led to mutual concessions, had been conducted, were
                        entitled to lower tariffs. They had earned it. But Congress was not prepared
                        to extend most favored nation treatment to other countries, which had not
                        made such concessions. In any case, to the extent that a trade agreement
                        could be negotiated with the Soviet Union the question of tariffs was not
                        too important. He thought that many things which the Soviet Union wanted to
                        export would be either free of duty or would be subject to very low duty
                        only, such as for example, chromium ore. It is for this reason that a list
                        of the commodities would be of interest to us, so that the problem could be
                        studied in its specifics.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> said that at a previous
                        conversation he had already explained that it was not the Soviet Government
                        itself which did the buying or selling but the foreign trade monopoly which
                        had been established in 1918. It has been this way since then, it is this
                        way now, and they did not intend to change this situation. Purchases abroad
                        were made by an All-Union trade association, which had its own budget, and
                        was responsible for its own activity. This provision was in the charter of
                        the association. It seemed to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> that Americans were not too well informed as to what
                        had happened with reference to Soviet foreign trade within <pb n="817" xml:id="pg_817" facs="0845"/>the last two years. A new tariff had been
                        established which contained two primary categories. Very low duties, or none
                        at all, applied to countries which had a trade agreement with the Soviet
                        Union. Higher duties applied to countries which had no trade agreement.
                        Therefore, their foreign trade organizations always had to calculate where
                        it would be more advantageous to buy, taking the tariffs into consideration.
                        For example, a trade agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany provided
                        for very low tariffs. Since no trade agreement with the United States was in
                        existence, higher tariffs applied. The foreign currency department of the
                        Ministry of Foreign Trade supervised all transactions to make sure that
                        purchases were made where this was most advantageous. He therefore thought
                        our Congress, too, was not too familiar with actual conditions in the Soviet
                        Union. In a conversation between Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> the question of buying in the U.S. had been raised and
                        answered by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that the
                        Soviet Union would buy American goods if they were competitive. When Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> said that, as a first
                        step, he was prepared to buy chemical equipment in the U.S., he did not mean
                        that he was prepared to pay a higher price than usual or that he would
                        absorb the higher duty, since the foreign trade association was not
                        permitted to overpay, and in its turn to over-charge its customer
                        organizations. He was sure, therefore, that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> would understand this was not a matter of solving
                        problems for him only, but also presented problems to be solved by the
                        U.S.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that we would be
                        interested in exploring this matter further, for the present perhaps between
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> and Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> wanted to clarify another
                        question. In a discussion between Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> the question of patents and licenses had been
                        raised. He did not quite understand the place of this problem in the
                        discussion of broadening trade.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that he had in mind some
                        concern for the protection of technology in the sale of equipment and plants
                        to the Soviet Union. When an American company sold to a Western European
                        country, it would not expect that such European country would take this
                        technology, copy it and then sell it to others in competition with the
                        American firm's products. We were interested in working out this problem. If
                        we were to sell plants and equipment to the Soviet Union we would not want
                        the Soviet Union to reproduce identical equipment and sell it in Western
                        Europe, or even to reproduce the same equipment for use within the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> said that obviously there
                        were many cases when American and Soviet inventions were made quite
                        independently of each other and differed in minor details only.</p>
                    <pb n="818" xml:id="pg_818" facs="0846"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Kennedy</persName> remarked that such similarity presented a
                        problem even where major problems of patent protection and licensing had
                        been solved, that it was this major problem we were dealing with.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> agreed, but said that this
                        was usually handled by means of special clauses in contracts concluded
                        between seller and buyer. Such clauses did not, of course, provide that the
                        final products of plant and equipment purchased could not be sold
                        abroad.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> did not think this problem
                        presented too many difficulties.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJ1">Chayes</persName> said that, in fact, we had
                        studied Soviet law and its provisions for the protection of technology. He
                        felt that in recent years, from our point of view, acceptable arrangements
                        for the protection and licensing of technology had been adopted.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> thought the
                        Soviets would find it easier to buy here if they were members of the
                        world-wide patent union.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Kennedy</persName> said that the U.S. was a member of two major
                        international patent organizations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> did not think that this
                        matter should be the subject of intergovernmental agreement but should be
                        provided for in each specific case, by means of special clauses in the
                        contract. It appeared to him that this was more a problem of conversation
                        than actual difficulty or danger. The Soviet Union fulfilled its
                        obligations. Moreover, two years ago a special foreign trade organization
                        section dealing with patents and licenses had been set up in order to
                        protect not only foreign patents in the U.S.S.R., but also Soviet patents
                        abroad.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Shershnev added that the Soviet Union had begun registering its patents
                        in the U.S., as well as American patents in the U.S.S.R.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> concluded this subject by
                        stating that he felt patents should not present any great problem. As for
                        the last question raised by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>, with reference to Lend-Lease, the point of view of
                        the Soviet Government was the same as during the last conversation conducted
                        by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> in 1960. He
                        would repeat that point of view: the Soviet Union could reach agreement on
                        the settlement of Lend-Lease payments but on the same two conditions—(1)
                        that a trade agreement be concluded and (2) that the question of credit be
                        resolved. Did he understand Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> correctly to the effect that the credit question
                        could be resolved in an overall Lend-Lease settlement?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> said that in
                        previous conversations the Soviet Union had always spoken in terms of U.S.
                        Government credits. This was not practical, but once a settlement of the
                        Lend-Lease claims had been achieved, any American firm would be in a
                        position to extend normal commercial terms to the Soviet Union, in some
                        cases possibly with a U.S. Government guarantee.</p>
                    <pb n="819" xml:id="pg_819" facs="0847"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> wanted to clarify why he
                        had raised the question of credit. Actually, any significant volume of trade
                        with the U.S. had been discontinued long ago. It was evident that the Soviet
                        Union would have practical difficulties, though he emphasized that this
                        would not be impossible, to pay all at once for everything that it wanted to
                        buy in the U.S. Therefore, it would be necessary to begin rehabilitating
                        their relations with American firms. During the past seven to ten years the
                        Soviet Union had purchased capital equipment on the world market on credit
                        terms. Assuming that the trade agreement could be concluded once again, it
                        would be primarily concerned with purchases of capital equipment. The Soviet
                        Union would want to obtain the same terms here as were available elsewhere.
                        Being exporters of capital equipment themselves, they too sold on credit,
                        for if they did not do so, no one would buy from them. It was a well-known
                        fact that in developing countries American and Western firms were competing
                        with the Soviet Union in selling equipment, and it was natural that whoever
                        sold for less and on better terms got the business. Therefore, their
                        interest in credit was quite logical. Actually, it did not mean the
                        introduction of anything new into international trade. This, then, was the
                        Soviet proposal on a settlement of outstanding Lend-Lease claims.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ball thought that this offered a basis for serious discussions. For the
                        present, such talks would perhaps be best conducted between Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> and Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, to see if something
                        could be worked out, that could subsequently be formalized in Moscow or in
                        Washington.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> said that he would have no
                        objection to such discussions and assumed that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> would not object to them either
                        although, should another convoy be detained in Germany, the Ambassador might
                        be out of circulation for two or three days.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that the government
                        would take the necessary steps to get the grain trade active with a view to
                        producing specific offers to the Soviet wheat delegation.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet group took a few minutes to consult among themselves with
                        reference to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s draft of the
                        letter mentioned earlier, and, following the changes suggested there, the
                        meeting was concluded.</p>

                        serious effect on her group's visit. I said that if they intend to go in

                        and I welcome opportunity to offer some suggestions on line he might take in
                        terms maximum possible impact on Sov as well as world audience.</p>
                    <p>My own view is that action against <persName corresp="#p_BFC1">Barghoorn</persName> by <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> security
                        authorities has undoubtedly disturbed Sov intellectual community and
                        possibly also those elements of <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>
                        bureaucracy which are not primarily concerned with internal security
                        considerations. It is apposite to point out that when making my demarche
                        yesterday to Foreign Office I had distinct impression that <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>, despite his past role as Soviet
                        “hatchet man” was embarrassed and such views as he expressed on <persName corresp="#p_BFC1">Barghoorn</persName> case seemed to me to lack usual
                        conviction which has characterized defense by Foreign Office spokesmen in
                        similar circumstances in past. <pb n="823" xml:id="pg_823" facs="0851"/>Smirnovsky, head of USA section who attended <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>, was clearly uncomfortable and appeared downcast

                            <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> reported on his meeting

                            November 13 in telegram 1638 from Moscow. In the meeting <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> expressed the “grave concern” of
                            the President and Secretary of State at the arrest of <persName corresp="#p_BFC1">Barghoorn</persName> and read <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> parts of a telegram that he had
                            from the President of Yale. (Ibid.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>While having of course no direct evidence of their attitude, I am certain
                        that many <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> intellectuals and particularly
                        elements of <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> academic community are
                        deeply upset by <persName corresp="#p_BFC1">Barghoorn</persName>'s arrest
                        and implications it may have for continued active interchange with Western
                        opposite numbers, although, of course, we must recognize that it would be
                        impolitic, if not dangerous, for them so to indicate to us or other Western
                        contacts.</p>
                    <p>I believe these considerations should be borne in mind in our handling of
                            <persName corresp="#p_BFC1">Barghoorn</persName> case and any public
                        statements we may make with regard to his arrest. The expressed reaction of
                        the American academic community is thus a particularly useful peg on which
                        to hang any public statement, and I would think it desirable for the
                        President amply to exploit the message from Yale University. The tone and
                        emphasis of the Yale statement in my view is exactly right, and it was for
                        this reason, of course, that I used it in my démarche to <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Naturally the President will wish to supplement his reference to the
                        consternation and shock of the American academic community at <persName corresp="#p_BFC1">Barghoorn</persName>'s arrest by a reiteration of his
                        own strong personal conviction that the arrest is wholly unwarranted and
                        unjustified along lines set forth in your message to me yesterday.</p>
                    <p>Further, in any prepared statement the President should plan I would think it
                        advisable to stress his personal concern that the <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s took an inordinately long time (at least 12 days) to
                        notify the Embassy of <persName corresp="#p_BFC1">Barghoorn</persName>'s
                        arrest and are continuing to deny access to him by appropriate American
                        officials and that this behavior is in contravention of established
                        international norms with regard to protection of nationals. I would suggest
                        that the formal statement made by the President be on this note.</p>
                    <p>Finally I would think it useful if the President would avoid any specific
                        threats of reprisal since this might set in motion irreversible trends
                        seriously restricting the maneuverability in policy which is vital, it seems
                        to me, in the present context of our relationships with the Soviet Union.
                        The President, however, should be prepared to deal with inevitable questions
                        with regard to the effect of <persName corresp="#p_BFC1">Barghoorn</persName>'s arrest on pending negotiations. In this
                        connection I would suggest that he respond along the following lines:</p>
                    <pb n="824" xml:id="pg_824" facs="0852"/>
                    <p>1. If the President should be asked (as we are being asked in Moscow by local
                        American correspondents) what bearing <persName corresp="#p_BFC1">Barghoorn</persName>'s arrest may have on the tentative agreement to
                        begin negotiations for the renewal of the Cultural Exchange Agreement, now
                        tentatively scheduled November 15, he might express the view that so long as
                        the Soviet Government persists in detaining <persName corresp="#p_BFC1">Barghoorn</persName> on grotesque and unwarranted charges it would be
                        inappropriate if not impossible to discuss with the Soviets continuation of
                        exchange arrangements with which such action by the Soviet Government is
                        totally incompatible. He could add that the exchange agreement envisages,
                        among other things, the development of wide contacts between American and
                        Soviet scholars in all fields and Soviet Government's action against
                            <persName corresp="#p_BFC1">Barghoorn</persName> raises apprehensions as
                        to how it intends to treat legitimate American scholars in the pursuit of
                        legitimate lines of inquiry. Naturally he would wish in this connection to
                        point out that the exchange negotiations do not involve the US Government
                        alone but require the cooperation and active participation of significant
                        segments of the American society, particularly the academic community. An
                        exchange agreement cannot be implemented nor can it be satisfactorily
                        negotiated without the full cooperation of such elements.</p>
                    <p>2. If the President should be questioned on the effect of <persName corresp="#p_BFC1">Barghoorn</persName>'s arrest on continuation of the
                        Consular Convention negotiations, he might state that the issue of
                        protection of nationals is one of the most vital points under discussion
                        with the Soviets in these negotiations. United States negotiators have made
                        it clear and will continue to stress that inordinate delay in notification
                        to American Consular Officials of the arrest of an American national is
                        unacceptable as well as denial of access to him by such officials. In this
                        connection the President will undoubtedly wish to underline the creditable
                        US record on these points with regard to recent clear cases of Soviet
                        espionage against United States.</p>
                    <p>One final suggestion which I hesitate to put in too positive terms since I
                        recognize that domestic considerations and other requirements may dictate
                        the course of action. With this reservation, I would think it advisable for
                        the President to avoid identifying the <persName corresp="#p_BFC1">Barghoorn</persName> case as obvious reprisal for Ivanov's arrest.<note n="4" xml:id="d374fn4"> I.A. Ivanov, an Amtorg employee who had been
                            arrested in New York in October for espionage.</note> He could field any
                        such question along this line by simply saying he, like many others, is

                    <p>Thursday a.m., November 14, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName> received telephone request from Soviet Embassy that
                        he see <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> on that day concerning
                        wheat transaction. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName>
                        agreed to appointment for that afternoon at 3:30 p.m.</p>
                    <p>Prior to meeting, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName>
                        notified State and Agriculture Departments of meeting and invited them to
                        have representative present. Notice of meeting was also given to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Bundy</persName> of White House staff.</p>
                    <p>Meeting with <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> convened in
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName>' office at 3:30 p.m.
                        Acting Maritime Administrator Giles and Assistant Secretary of State
                            <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> were present. Under
                        Secretary Murphy (Agriculture) could not attend due to conflicting
                        appointment. Under Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                        and Roosevelt were out of the city.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> was accompanied by his
                        interpreter who had been with him on previous meetings at State Department
                        and by three others of his regular group (names not obtained).</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> opened conversation by saying
                        he wanted to buy wheat but American traders apparently did not want to sell
                        wheat; that he had received offers on only small quantities and that
                        transportation charges were much above world prices. He wondered if the
                        United States Government could not do something.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName> responded that he did
                        not know why American traders may be offering to sell only small quantities
                        of the proposed 2-1/2 million tons; that it may be due to fact they were
                        waiting for official release of information on shipping guidelines and
                        export licenses which were being made public that day.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> then referred to high
                        American shipping rates; that he understood from his last conversation with
                        Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> that American
                        shipping would be available at reasonable rates in relation to world prices;
                        that this meant shipping at world rates; that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> had indicated the U.S. Government
                        would be able to make arrangements about shipping, etc. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> referred to copy of Under Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s letter of November
                            8th.<note n="2" xml:id="d375fn2">See <ref target="#d371fn1">footnote 1,

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName> responded that he was
                        not present at his conversations with the State Department, and Assistant
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Kennedy</persName> would have to speak to that.</p>
                    <pb n="826" xml:id="pg_826" facs="0854"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Kennedy</persName> replied to <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                        had not said American shipping rates would be the same as foreign rates but
                        that on a C and F basis, with no more than 50% American vessels used, the
                        difference between American and foreign rates would narrow, that foreign
                        rates could be expected to go up and any difference in the delivered prices
                        on the total transaction would not be significant. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Kennedy</persName> said the “arrangements” by the U.S.
                        Government Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> referred to meant
                        the publication of the export control bulletin and the shipping rate
                        guidelines. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Kennedy</persName> also reminded Borisov that
                        present U.S. wheat price is some 6 cents per bushel below the Canadian price
                        and this meant the U.S. Government was really helping to hold down the
                        “world price” on wheat.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName> said to <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> he wanted to emphasize that U.S.
                        shipping rates are higher than foreign rates because of higher American
                        wages and costs. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName>
                        said, you will have to pay higher rates on shipping in American vessels.
                        There is no way to get around that, and will be no way. The Secretary
                        reminded <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> that he had told him
                        on the occasion of their first meeting upon arrival in this country that
                        rates on American vessels are higher.</p>
                    <p>Acting Maritime Administrator Giles pointed out that the U.S. Government had
                        taken important steps to resolve the shipping problem on a fair basis. That
                        initially it was understood and agreed 100% of the wheat would go on
                        American vessels. This had been reduced to 50%. That in addition rate
                        guidelines for the larger vessels had been reduced 20% over the strong
                        objection of shipping industry people. That a spokesman had strongly
                        criticized the Administration earlier this week. (This was Max Harrison,
                        president of the American Maritime Association in speech to the AFL-CIO
                        Convention.) Thus, the U.S. Government had met the Soviet Government more
                        than half way in an effort to resolve the shipping rate matter.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName> again mentioned the
                        current difference between the Canadian and U.S. prices on wheat, with
                        current U.S. price more than $2.00 per ton below the Canadian price on
                        comparable grade.</p>
                    <p>At various points <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> commented to
                        effect that the matter of U.S. costs and arrangements on shipping was an
                        internal matter for the U.S., that the Soviet Government could not subsidize
                        U.S. shipping but that the U.S. could do so if it wished.</p>
                    <p>The conversations ended with <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName>
                        asking the Secretary to do what he could in finding out about the market
                        situation and bringing about the best situation. The Secretary stated he
                        could not set prices, that was done by the buyer and seller but he would do
                        the best he could in finding out why American traders are not offering to
                        sell in large quantities and do what he could generally to be helpful.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> responded by saying he
                        did not ask for anymore than the Secretary's best.</p>
                    <p>The conference ended at approximately 4:50 p.m.</p>
                    <pb n="827" xml:id="pg_827" facs="0855"/>
                    <p>Further notes by writer of this memorandum</p>
                    <p>Prior to the conference with <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName>
                        it was learned through Maritime Administration sources that the Soviets had
                        received an offer from Continental of 200,000 tons of wheat at $81.50 per
                        ton, ($15.50 for shipping) and had received an offer from a small trader
                        (Kerr) of 30,000 tons at $79.50 ($13.50 for shipping). Both of these offers
                        were turned down by the Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> did not mention having an offer of $79.50 per ton
                        delivered to Odessa.</p>
                    <p>On Friday morning Giles exchanged information and views with Under Secretary
                        Murphy, and also reported developments by phone to Under Secretary Roosevelt
                        who was then in Richmond.</p>
                    <p>There was further exchange of information and views between Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName> and Under Secretary Murphy
                        Friday about 2:30 p.m. Mr. Murphy had learned from grain sources the Soviets
                        had a contract form prepared and would ask next week for best offers on
                        650,000 tons of wheat for delivery each month during January, February,
                        March and April. Through Maritime Administration, received information that
                        this week the grain people had stopped asking for shipping quotations, that
                        no one was looking for tonnage for the Soviets because the Soviets had
                        turned down what seemed to be reasonable offers. The shipping broker (by the
                        name of Najor) said he had been in direct contact with the Soviets Thursday
                        evening and they told him they could pay no more than $12.00 for shipping.
                        They also told him they were awaiting further instructions from Moscow.
                        Najor reported he had also heard the Soviets had “put pressure” on the
                        Hungarians for buying American wheat at too high prices.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName> decided Friday
                        afternoon in conversation with Under Secretary Roosevelt (who had just
                        returned) and Giles that he (Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName>) should not initiate any follow-up contact with
                            <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> at this time.</p>

                    <p>On the occasion of the Soviet Ambassador's call today, I remarked that recent
                        developments in our relations had not been good. He said he was quite
                        concerned about this and said he was sure that in Moscow they were at a loss
                        to understand what was happening. He mentioned recent public speeches, the
                        furor about the <persName corresp="#p_BFC1">Barghoorn</persName> case and
                        the autobahn incidents, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s
                            trip,<note n="2" xml:id="d377fn2">Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> visited Europe in mid-November for
                            conversations on economic and trade questions. In London on November 15
                            he held an extensive discussion with Board of Trade and Foreign Office
                            officials about the differences between the British and U.S. attitudes
                            toward the extension of long-term credits to the Soviet Union. (Telegram
                            2391 from London, November 15; ibid., Conference Files: Lot 66 D 110, CF
                            2339)</note> and the wheat deal. He said that as he had little time
                        today, he would like to have me around soon for a longer talk about these
                        matters. I observed that with respect to speeches, that he should keep in
                        mind that when Government officials talk about how strong we were in the
                        military field, this had a relationship to our efforts to keep down the
                        military budget. He said he could understand this but such speeches had
                        different interpretations elsewhere, including Moscow.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said he was certain that his Government would be baffled by
                        the fact that we had begun discussions about improving trade with the Soviet
                        Union and the fact that immediately thereafter Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> had gone to Europe and according to
                        press reports had endeavored to cut back Western trade with the Soviet
                        Union. On this point I said I could categorically tell him that the
                        newspaper reports were quite wrong and I said that some of them had
                        undoubtedly been deliberately put out by people with a special interest to
                        serve. I said that speaking quite frankly we were not ourselves concerned in
                        any competitive way about credits to the Soviet Union because of our own
                        legal restrictions. I said that on the other hand, from the point of view of
                        the Western Alliance, we did not think it wise for the Western countries to
                        get into a credit war with each other to see who could give the Soviet Union
                        the longest credit. I pointed out that such developments affected the
                        relations of our Allies with each <pb n="830" xml:id="pg_830" facs="0858"/>other and it was this aspect that was of particular concern to us. I said
                        that, moreover, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> had not gone
                        to Europe to deal with this question and it was only a minor item on a long
                        agenda. Moreover, I referred to the fact that there were some standard
                        procedures about credit to which most of the Western countries adhered, and
                        that these applied not only to the Soviet Union, but to all other countries.
                        I pointed out that as a country with the largest reservoir of credit, the
                        United States might stand to gain from a competitive point of view if these
                        practices were changed, but we did not believe that this was in the overall
                        Western interest. When he said he understood, nevertheless, that we had
                        tried to reduce the present trade practices of the West with the Soviet
                        Union and to reduce this trade, I said I could assure him categorically that
                        this was not the case.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the wheat deal, he said that he had not been in on all of the
                        conversations but from the last one he himself had believed that we had
                        agreed to make arrangements so that the Soviets could buy wheat at, or very
                        nearly at, world prices. He said <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> had so reported to the Soviet Government. He said
                        that <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> had no authority to go
                        even one dollar over world prices, that he had reported recent developments
                        to his Government, and he did not know what the answer would be.<note n="3" xml:id="d377fn3">Following the meeting with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HL1">Hodges</persName> (see <ref target="#d375">Document
                                375</ref>), <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> had met
                            with <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> on November 19 and
                            complained about the higher cost of U.S. wheat and the requirement for
                            50-50 shipping. <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Borisov</persName> ended the
                            discussion by saying the Soviet Union was willing to buy U.S. wheat, but
                            that it was out of the question to pay more than world prices.
                            (Memorandum of conversation, November 19; Department of State, Central
                            Files, INCO-WHEAT US)</note> I said that I could see that there was some
                        ground for some misunderstanding but, on the other hand, it was quite clear
                        from the whole tenor of the negotiations that we had not agreed to meet
                        world prices as they defined them, including shipping. I pointed out that
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> had said specifically that
                        we would not subsidize American shipping to meet the Soviet desires, and
                        that he had said merely that he hoped the arrangements we were making would
                        bring the eventual prices offered reasonably close to world prices.<note n="4" xml:id="d377fn4">On November 20 the President had called <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> to ask whether he should send

                    <p>The Ambassador asked to see me today for what he called a personal
                        conversation, most of which related to the arrangements for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>'s visit.<note n="2" xml:id="d379fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> was visiting Washington
                            for the funeral of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>He raised the question of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>
                        seeing the President, and I told him what the tentative arrangements were.
                        He asked about the President's views on foreign affairs, and I pointed out
                        how closely the new President had followed these matters and been kept
                        informed by President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>. I
                        expressed the opinion that, in general, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> would continue the broad policies
                        established by President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, and
                        drew his attention to the fact that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had assisted in the formulation of these policies. I
                        said that naturally the new President would have a different style of
                        operation, and I suspected would devote a larger proportion of his time to
                        domestic affairs.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador inquired about the relationship of the Attorney General to the
                        new President, and I said I understood that they had worked well and closely
                        together. I said that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had already expressed his intention to keep most of
                        the Administration intact.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador observed that the new President had traveled broadly and was
                        obviously well informed about foreign affairs.</p>
                    <p>When the Ambassador pressed me for personal advice on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>'s visit, I said that he would
                        probably be invited to speak on television and that my personal view was
                        that this was not a good time for him to do so regardless of what he said.
                        The Ambassador seemed to agree with this point of view.</p>
                    <p>I also said that the new President would need time to settle into office, and
                        that I personally thought that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> would be well advised not to stay for a long period
                        in Washington on this visit. I pointed out that the public had been highly
                        aroused by the assassination of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, that in any country there were crackpots, and it
                        was always possible that there could be unpleasant incidents such as <pb n="833" xml:id="pg_833" facs="0861"/>demonstrations which would not be
                        good for either country. The Ambassador also seemed to agree with this
                        judgment.</p>
                    <p>At the end of our conversation, the Ambassador asked if President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> was informed about the private
                        correspondence between President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. I said that I was not sure that the new
                        President had seen all of the exchanges, but assumed that any that he had
                        missed would be brought to his attention if they were of current
                        significance.</p>

                    <p>During a brief exchange of amenities while pictures were being taken, the
                        President handed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> a
                        personal message for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>

                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> opened the conversation by
                        saying that before leaving Moscow Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and he had talked about Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s meeting with the President,
                        then a Senator, at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s visit to the US in
                        1959. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        <pb n="834" xml:id="pg_834" facs="0862"/>recalled that the President had
                        asked him some questions at that meeting and that the President and Senator
                        Fulbright had seen him to his car when he was leaving. The President had
                        then told him, with a touch of American humor, that he should become a US
                        Senator and that he would make an outstanding one. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had replied that each of them
                        should work in his own parliament and fight for peace. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> continued that he remembered the
                        press reporting at that time that in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Kennedy</persName>'s view
                        the meeting with the Foreign Relations Committee had gone well and that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was a strong man who
                        was well able to defend his point of view. Thus, even at that time there had
                        been some contact and a beginning of mutual understanding between the
                        President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. As he
                        had said earlier, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and
                        he had talked about this before his departure from Moscow.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> then said that on the
                        basis of his own meetings in Moscow he thought contacts could be maintained
                        and mutual understanding brought about.</p>
                    <p>The President responded that the leaders of our two countries would be a
                        failure in the history of the world if they were unable to find an answer to
                        how the two sides could live together peacefully and beneficially in the
                        world. This was the big challenge of our times. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had seemed to be making, with their respective
                        leaders, some advances in that direction. The only really important thing
                        was what was the answer and how we could do it, because if we could find an
                        answer, the world would be indeed a much better place to live. The United
                        States was earnestly seeking friendship and cooperation with all nations of
                        the world. The United States did not seek hostility with anyone; it courted
                        no territory and was not seeking domination of any people. The President
                        went on to say that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s foremost thought every day had been what steps could
                        be taken on that particular day to bring about a better understanding
                        between the peoples of the world. The President said this policy had been
                        fully embraced by him and would be respected and continued. The United
                        States would meet anyone more than half way.</p>
                    <p>The President then noted that the United States was not planning to invade
                        Cuba, but that the Cuban problem was a very serious one with our people. He
                        hoped that as days came and went we would be able to find a solution there
                        which would make it possible to lead our peoples further towards peace and
                        understanding. Actions already taken had gone part of the way and some
                        lessening of tension had taken place. We had a number of problems at home
                        which were quite troublesome, and if there was any indication at any time
                        that we could in some way bring about better understanding and better
                        relations we would go our part of the way. We were dedicated to our system
                        and intended to preserve it, <pb n="835" xml:id="pg_835" facs="0863"/>but
                        this did not mean that we wanted it to dominate or enslave any other
                        people.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said he was happy to hear
                        these words uttered by the new President of the United States. The
                        President's desire to live in peace and friendship with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and with other nations was in full accord
                        with the views of the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that there would be no change in the
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> policy. We were very happy that Congress
                        had shown evidences of approving negotiations and exchanges of views between
                        President Kennedy and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.
                        This had offered us real encouragement not only in their attitude but also
                        in our people's attitude. Our constant purpose, each day, would be to seek
                        to travel the road of peace and to find solutions to many problems that
                        engaged the two sides and to many differences existing between them.</p>
                    <p>The President continued that as an immediate comment he wished to say that
                        the problem which was the biggest with our people was the result of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>-promoted subversion. This
                        inevitably and invariably gave us strained relations. He hoped, however,
                        that in future both sides would find that they had moved further to peace
                        and had made gains greater than even those made by his predecessor and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said he was very much
                        gratified to hear this. However, there was only one point he wished to
                        comment on, namely, the President's remark concerning Cuban subversive
                        activities. He said he could not understand how a small nation like Cuba
                        could subvert anyone, let alone a big power. On the contrary, the whole
                        world could see how small Cuba was being subverted by a number of various,
                        well-financed organizations. The Soviet Union believed that all subversive
                        activities should be ended everywhere. He asserted that he knew Cuba did not
                        want to subvert anyone. In his conversation with <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>, the latter had told him that he wanted good
                        relations with the United States. In his statement on the occasion of the
                        tragedy falling upon the United States, <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> had shown himself as a great humanitarian as he had
                        voiced deep regret about President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s death. Therefore, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> continued, he wished to ask the President not to
                        accept the allegations which were sometimes mentioned in the press. He
                        wanted the President to believe him that good relations with Cuba were in
                        the interest of the United States.</p>
                    <p>The President responded that his intention had been simply to give an
                        evaluation of the feelings of our people and of what gave them problems. He
                        said he had spoken sincerely and earnestly about US intentions with respect
                        to Cuba. We had no plans for invasion, and we believed that there was no
                        justification for Cuba to invade others by subversion or otherwise. The
                        President reiterated that what he was seeking now was <pb n="836" xml:id="pg_836" facs="0864"/>merely to give Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> an evaluation and expressed the
                        hope that better understanding could flow from this.</p>
                    <p>The President then thanked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>
                        for his coming to Washington to honor and to pay tribute to the late
                        President by his presence. He said he looked forward to further meetings and
                        exchanges of views of this kind and hoped that they would be fruitful.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> concluded the conversation
                        by noting that he knew the President was very busy today and that he did not
                        wish to take any more of the President's time. However, he wished to add
                        just one comment of a personal nature, and note that he had turned 68
                        yesterday, while here in Washington. He said he trusted that further
                        meetings would take place, including meetings with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, and that those meetings would
                        be fruitful.</p>
                    <p>The meeting ended at 12:30 p.m.</p>

                    <p>In response to the President's remarks about the peaceful intentions of the
                        United States, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that
                        instead of setting forth the Soviet views on these matters he wished to hand
                        the President a message for him from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. He then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SVM1">Sukhodrev</persName> to read the text of the message in English.<note n="2" xml:id="d381fn2">See <ref target="frus1961-63v06">

                    <p>The President said he appreciated the message very much and noted that we
                        would certainly continue the policy of exchange of information and free
                        communication. He observed that when he had been a little boy he had been
                        told that no man's judgment on any question was better than his information
                        on that particular question. Of course, information could come only from
                        communication. He hoped that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> would convey to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that he was looking forward to communicating
                        freely with him. This could be done by means of letters, provided, of
                        course, that they remained private. In this connection, he assumed that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s and his own letters
                        already exchanged were not for publication.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> assured the President that
                        if it was agreed that the exchange be private there would be no leaks
                        anywhere as far as the Soviet Union was concerned. The system at the top of
                        the Soviet Government was such as to preclude the possibility of any leaks.
                        He also wished to point out that as far as the Soviet Ambassador in
                        Washington was concerned, the President could be absolutely sure that he
                        would not allow any leaks. Consequently, if the President wished to
                        communicate with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        through the Ambassador, he could be assured that no one in Washington,
                        except the Ambassador himself, would be familiar with the communication. As
                        to Moscow, only Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        himself and his closest associates would have the knowledge of the
                        message.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he wished to give the same assurances on our
                        part.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> commented that he realized
                        even without this the exchanges would be private.</p>

                        convincing words. He had favorable impression President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and way he intends carry on.
                        Thought useful to convey his impressions to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and other leaders <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary said despite our differences and method of approach to problems,
                        important that we explore all possibilities where areas of common interests
                        might be found even though formal agreements could not be concluded. Cited
                        as example arms race and expressed wish find some way this could be dampened
                        and expenditures lessened even without formal agreement.</p>
                    <p>Secretary mentioned non-dissemination as one area where our two Governments
                        had common interest in preventing non-nuclear powers obtaining nuclear
                        weapons or nuclear capability. Much of remaining time was taken by <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> in arguing against <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> along standard Soviet lines. Secretary
                        explained in forceful terms <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would not
                        involve transfer of nuclear weapons to Germans or any other nation. Asked
                        Soviets to wait until details on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> known.
                        This would convince them that no transfer involved. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> did agree that two Governments had
                        common interest in non-dissemination.</p>
                    <p>Conversation concluded with Secretary saying on bilateral matters that we
                        would go ahead with Consular Convention and exchanges negotiations, would be
                        in touch on civil aviation and hoped to improve trade, though this was more
                        difficult. As regards broader international questions, Secretary would be
                        consulting with our Allies in December and perhaps after the New Year would
                        be in position to discuss them.</p>

                    <p>1824. In course my meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> today, which I had requested for purpose discussing
                        pending bilateral issues (e.g., Civil Air Agreement, leased line, Consular
                        Convention), <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FonMin</gloss> briefly and in <pb n="839" xml:id="pg_839" facs="0867"/>general terms touched on
                        desirability of progress toward relaxation of tensions. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he had in mind need for action
                        on broad issues which he had discussed with Secy and late President when in

                        and he hoped, therefore, Washington would soon come up with specific

                    <p>I said I understood Secy had discussed problem with <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>

                        reminded <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that there would be
                        further opportunities for such consultation at upcoming <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial Meeting as well as during
                        planned visits to Washington after first of year by leaders of certain of
                        our allies.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> commented wryly that he hoped
                        in such consultations we planned to search for keys to solutions rather than
                        provide additional locks. He then said if he were asked to name problem
                        requiring most urgent solution, he would be obliged to cite problem of
                        Germany.</p>
                    <p>I said I readily agreed that German problem was of cardinal importance but,
                        unfortunately, our suggestions for its solution were widely disparate. In
                        any case, I could assure <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that
                        we were equally anxious to seek and settle on ways of relaxing tension but
                        we did feel at moment best chances of quick progress toward this goal lay in
                        bilateral field.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> concluded the discussion by
                        remarking that while avoiding a worsening of international situation is
                        better than worsening it, best course is to take positive steps for
                        improvement by removing current blocks. I said that was precisely purpose of

                    <p>On December 5, 1963, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                        held his first National Security Council meeting. The topic was “Soviet
                        Military Capabilities.” Following a briefing by Director of Central
                        Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>, the President
                        asked Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to
                        comment. According to the summary record of the meeting, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> “emphasized that despite the problems
                        which the Soviet Union is having in the economic field, and despite our
                        nuclear superiority, the Russians are making a tremendous effort. We cannot
                        reduce our effort in any way—military, space, economic assistance, etc. We
                        have a full agenda ahead of us. We should concentrate on those factors which
                        make people pull the nuclear trigger. We should be ready to explore
                        agreements with the Soviets which are based on our current military
                        strength.” Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then commented on the relative military strength of
                        the United States and the Soviet Union, noting that during the 1960s “our
                        advantage over the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in the nuclear area
                        will not fall below two times.” For text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v08">

                    <p>DEAR TOMMY: So much has happened since the autobahn impasse and the post
                        midnight calls to me in Cornwall last month that it all defies review or
                        appropriate comment—November 7 and the Time-Life group, <persName corresp="#p_BFC1">Freddie Barghoorn</persName>'s ordeal, the devastating
                        assassination of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>,
                        the encouraging start of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. So instead of reviewing the past, I'll just move
                        toward the future.</p>
                    <p>I greatly appreciate your letters of November 29 and particularly the
                        enclosures to the second.<note n="2" xml:id="d385fn2">The second letter

                    <p>I have been giving considerable thought—as I'm sure you and others in
                        Washington have—to the question of how we may best continue the dialogue
                        between ourselves and the Soviets. I was glad that in his talk with
                            <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>
                        <note n="3" xml:id="d385fn3">See <ref target="#d380">Documents 380</ref> and

                        maintaining the tradition of private exchanges with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and that in his letter the
                        Chairman also endorsed the idea.<note n="4" xml:id="d385fn4">See <ref target="frus1961-63v06">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961-1963, vol. VI</ref>,
                            pp. 311-313.</note> While this is useful, I feel strongly that if this
                        medium has been valuable in the past it was precisely because it had its
                        origin in a personal confrontation between the two principals. This is a
                        missing element now, and just as I felt nearly three years ago—a feeling you
                        shared—that there should be an early meeting between President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, so do I now feel that such a meeting would be
                        useful for the new President.</p>
                    <p>There seems little question that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would welcome the idea. In his remarks to me at
                        Spaso when he signed the book of condolences,<note n="5" xml:id="d385fn5">See <ref target="#d378">Document 378</ref>.</note> he referred several
                        times to the usefulness of Vienna in his relationship with President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and he pointedly remarked
                        on his lack of knowledge of the successor. He makes a similar point in his
                        letter to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>.</p>
                    <p>I have just read the President's statement about traveling abroad.<note n="6" xml:id="d385fn6">For a transcript of the President's press conference on
                            December 12 during which he stated that he would not be traveling
                            abroad, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the
                                United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                                    Johnson</persName>, 1963-64</hi>, Book I, pp. 34-38.</note>
                        Despite this, I would hope he also would see merit in an early meeting. I'm
                        sure he recognizes the advantages of personal confrontation over
                        correspondence and the advice of even the best experts in taking the measure
                        of a principal adversary. Beyond this, there is, it seems to me, a sound
                        tactical reason for early agreement on the idea of a meeting. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, given his personal modus
                        operandi and the imperatives of communist dynamics, must at some point test
                        the will and determination of his new adversary. While we can't avoid this,
                        we can and should, I think, make an effort to postpone the test until the
                        new administration has time to shake down a bit. With a meeting in the
                        offing, I doubt if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would
                        attempt an early showdown.</p>
                    <p>On timing, I would think a meeting should follow the upcoming round of talks
                        with Allied leaders and well precede the Party Conventions. March or April
                        would seem the most suitable time—certainly not later than May. If a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> spring summit is in the cards, as I have
                        heard suggested, I would think a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> before rather than after would be preferable to
                        avoid an impression that the President was in a position to negotiate on
                        behalf of the alliance or even to act as its spokesman. Perhaps it would be
                        desirable to schedule a meeting with <pb n="842" xml:id="pg_842" facs="0870"/>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> just prior to a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> summit to permit the President to report
                        directly to his colleagues on the return trip.</p>
                    <p>As far as we can tell, this timing would fit <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s schedule; his only announced activity which he
                        would find it difficult to rearrange is his June trip to Scandinavia.</p>
                    <p>On the site, I suppose an obvious requirement is that the meeting take place
                        on neutral soil. There have been rumors about Stockholm as a suitable spot;
                        I would not think this desirable because of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s plans to visit there on his Scandinavian swing.
                        I would opt for Vienna or some city in Switzerland.</p>
                    <p>One more thought. Despite the lack of positive reaction, the Soviets have not
                        abandoned their idea of an <gloss target="#t_ENDC1">ENDC</gloss> summit in
                        Moscow. While recent treatment has been in low key, the proposal has been
                        kept alive by occasional references in the press, the most recent being in
                        the joint communiqué following Novotny's visit. The prospect of a private
                        meeting with the President would almost certainly abate any enthusiasm
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may have for an
                        eighteen-nation summit and would relieve any pressure there may be from
                        neutral quarters for the idea.</p>
                    <p>Finally, a hooker. On the record, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is committed to visit Cuba sometime this winter.
                        We have heard little about this lately and the idea may have been abandoned
                        in view of <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName>'s failure to sign
                        the Test Ban Treaty and of his general wavering between Moscow and Peiping.
                        Such a visit would clearly be absolutely incompatible with any meeting with
                        President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, at least before
                        our election next fall. Consequently, if there should be a tendency toward a
                            US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> meeting in the reasonably near
                        future, this consideration should be put forward to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> frankly and firmly. I believe he
                        is enough of a realist to get and accept the point.</p>
                    <p>For obvious reasons, I felt it unwise to surface these ideas in a formal
                        message from the Embassy, but felt they should be put forward to you—and
                        through you to the Secretary and any others with whom you may think they
                        should be shared. I should, of course, appreciate your own informal
                        reactions to the foregoing and your own thoughts on the subject.</p>

                        leaders now seem to be preparing for a protracted stalemate in the conflict.
                        They have reverted to a position set forth by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> at the East German party congress last January,
                        when he appealed for “tolerance and patience,” a cessation of polemics, and
                        a pause to give the adversaries a “chance to calm down” before convening a

                        meetings renewed <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        appeals, avoided direct assaults on the Chinese, and reiterated his dictum
                        that “time will determine which point of view is correct.”</p>
                    <p>In view of the strong resistance within the Communist movement to any Soviet
                        attempt to force a showdown, which almost certainly would result in a formal
                        and avowed rupture, the Soviet leaders apparently see no alternative to
                        accepting another pause, during which they will pursue less provocative and
                        risky efforts to isolate the Chinese and prove that Peiping is solely
                        responsible for continuation of the conflict.</p>
                    <p>Moscow is maintaining a virtual suspension of anti-Chinese propaganda. The
                            <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> article of 6 December piously warned
                        against “overdramatizing” the situation and regarding it as “irreparable.”
                        It recalled <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s appeals in
                        January and October for a cessation of polemics and proposed discussions
                        within the “normal channel of inter-party relations,” which would create
                        “more favorable conditions” for a new world Communist meeting. There are no
                        indications, however, that the Russians expect either a resumption of
                        bilateral talks or an international conference in the near future. The
                        Soviet ambassador in Peiping told the British charge on 2 December that the
                        Chinese had not suggested resumption and that no meeting was planned in
                        Peiping or elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>Although the Chinese have not directly commented on the new Soviet appeal,
                        they have made it clear that they have no intention of accom<pb n="844" xml:id="pg_844" facs="0872"/>modating the Russians. On 10 December,
                        Peiping repeated its charge that “anti-China propaganda” in the Soviet press
                        has exposed the “hypocrisy and ulterior motives behind the <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> leaders' so-called call for a halt to
                        open polemics.” Whereas Moscow ignored the defiant tactics of the Chinese
                        delegation at the recent World Peace Council session in Warsaw, Peiping
                        played up the clashes and denounced the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for “stage-managing an anti-China scandal.”</p>
                    <p>Peiping has also continued its series of long articles attacking the July
                        exposition of Soviet positions. The sixth, published simultaneously in
                        People's Daily and Red Flag on 12 December, juxtaposes <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s revisionist views of “peaceful
                        coexistence” with the correct Leninist line followed by the Chinese. There
                        does not appear to be anything new in the Chinese argumentation on this
                        question, but the article maintains the Chinese insistence that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is evil incarnate.</p>

                        between the President and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        not later than May of next year in either Vienna or Switzerland. Although I
                        would suggest that we keep an open mind about such a possibility, I would
                        not, myself, at this time, recommend such a meeting for the following
                        reasons:</p>
                    <p>1. I should think it would be far better if the President could defer meeting
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> until after the
                        elections when he can face him with a mandate from the people based upon his
                        campaign platform. I should also think that in any meeting shortly before
                        the Party conventions, the President would be greatly handicapped in what he
                        could say and do and that a meeting would risk injecting into the campaign
                        East-West issues <pb n="845" xml:id="pg_845" facs="0873"/>in a form that may
                        not be helpful. The Soviets have given many indications on a low level that
                        they recognize that major agreements with the United States will be
                        difficult if not impossible until after our elections.</p>
                    <p>2. So far as <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is concerned,
                        while I think he might like a meeting for reasons of prestige, I think that
                        he also would be handicapped in any meeting at an early date. He will
                        probably still be beset by internal difficulties and, more importantly, it
                        is unlikely that his quarrel with the Chinese Communists will have reached a
                        definitive stage. Moreover, he will not have had much time to see what
                        direction the four new governments in the West are going to take.</p>
                    <p>3. While it would be possible to bill such a meeting merely as an opportunity
                        for the two men to get acquainted along the lines of the Vienna meeting
                        between President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, I think that in fact
                        this poses some difficulties. I think it would be essential for both parties
                        to have at least some discussion of the Cuban and German and Berlin problems
                        and, at this stage, I should think any such discussion would probably be
                        harmful in the sense of resulting in a hardening of positions on both sides.
                        Moreover, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> has met
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> when he visited the
                        United States and has followed so closely our relations with the Soviet
                        Union that I do not think the need is the same as it was with President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> when he first took
                        office.</p>
                    <p>4. I should also think that no matter how we tried to play such a meeting, it
                        would disturb our Allies for a variety of reasons.</p>
                    <p>The views expressed above would be materially affected should the possibility
                        of an agreement on some major subject develop between now and next Spring,
                        but I think such a prospect most unlikely.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>I had a very agreeable two hours today with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. His first and dominant interest
                        was to learn of the points of view and the <pb n="846" xml:id="pg_846" facs="0874"/>process of action of the new Administration. I told him
                        that the President's first object was to strengthen the peace, and that he
                        could rely on the depth and sincerity of the comments in this direction
                        expressed by the President to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>
                        <note n="2" xml:id="d388fn2">See <ref target="#d380">Documents 380</ref> and
                                <ref target="#d381">381</ref>.</note> and on a number of other
                        occasions in recent weeks. I also told him that we were appreciative of the
                        restraint and good will shown by the Soviet Government toward President
                            <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador seemed to accept these assurances, but said that he was
                        concerned about one area—Cuba. He called attention to press reports of a
                        re-examination of our Cuban policy and was at some pains to emphasize that
                        such press reports always created concern in Moscow. I told him that any new
                        American President would necessarily have to ask for a re-examination of the
                        Cuban situation, since that situation was unsatisfactory to us both on the
                        merits and in political terms. But I said that he could rely on the
                        President's assurance to <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> that
                        we did not intend to invade Cuba, and I told him that while we would
                        continue to seek ways and means of strengthening our position toward the
                            <persName corresp="#p_CF1">Castro</persName> regime, we had no intention
                        of provoking a war in that area. I said that our position toward Cuba was
                        not very different from what I understood to be the position of his
                        government toward Berlin; I assumed that the leaders of the Soviet
                        Government were dissatisfied with the situation in Berlin, but did not wish
                        a war there, and that they might well be asking their staffs continuously
                        what could be done to improve the situation in Berlin without provoking a
                        war.</p>
                    <p>In response to his more general question about the new Administration, I told
                        the Ambassador in a general way about the continuation in office of the
                        principal officers of the <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> Administration. I
                        described briefly the high quality and the good sense of the principal new
                        staff officers at the White House. I told the Ambassador that he could
                        continue to rely on the Secretary of State, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>, and myself with respect to the
                        most private communications. And when he suggested that the Attorney General
                        might be less engaged in these problems, I told him not to be so sure—that
                        the Attorney General was a very important member of this Administration,
                        too, and continued to have a deep interest in foreign affairs. But later in
                        the conversation when the Ambassador asked in the most explicit way where he
                        should go with his most private messages, I told him that I thought his best
                        bet was Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador and I had quite an exchange on Germany in which for a minute
                        or two I thought he was going to talk quite informally about the importance
                        of reaching a solution that would be more secure than the existing
                        situation. I told him quite bluntly that the key to a more forthcoming
                        position on our side was the possibility of self-determination for <pb n="847" xml:id="pg_847" facs="0875"/>the East Germans, and said that it
                        seemed to me that much could be done in the real interest of our two
                        countries if the Soviets could accept the prospect of a change here.</p>
                    <p>In this connection the Ambassador gave me a long and emotional account of
                        Soviet opinion of the Germans, pointing out the depth and strength of the
                        emotional deposit of the two World Wars. I told him that we understand this
                        feeling and respect it and that our own German policy was designed with this
                        concern in mind. We discussed the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> in the
                        usual terms, but I think I made some slight progress in persuading him that
                        our German policy, including our proposal for an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> took account of the German right in a way in which his
                        government's policy did not. At least he failed to answer my questions about
                        the consequences for the German right of the standard Soviet policies which
                        he was urging. The Ambassador, as on previous occasions, refused the contest
                        when I made uncomplimentary remarks about <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>.</p>
                    <p>We had an extended discussion of the wheat deal, in which I think we agreed
                        that there had been an honest misunderstanding with respect to American
                        bottoms and their prices. The Ambassador explained how he had been surprised
                        to be instructed that he could offer to carry the wheat in American bottoms,
                        and I explained that we had assumed that no such offer would be made except
                        with an understanding of the costs implied. He said that, for his part, if
                        anyone had asked him about the cost he would have been careful to reserve
                        the Soviet position. I said that the value of the wheat deal seemed to me to
                        be much greater than the difference in price still existing between the
                        negotiators, and that therefore I would urge on his government an increased
                        flexibility and responsiveness in seeking individual agreements. I said that
                        it was very difficult for us to make a package deal but that, on the other
                        hand, we had no desire to make profits on any small differential in price.
                        The American bottoms were necessary to us for quite straightforward tactical
                        reasons, relating especially to the attitude of the unions which would have
                        to load the wheat. I had the impression that the Ambassador had only an
                        incomplete understanding of the domestic complexities of the wheat deal from
                        our point of view, and I think it may be useful for a more expert witness to
                        give him another dose on this score. The Ambassador told me that his own
                        government at the moment was quite discouraged about the wheat deal but that
                        at least they were treating it in a low key, which he indicated had been his
                        own urgent recommendation. I repeated that the political advantage was worth
                        further effort, especially on the Soviet side.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador went from this point to a discussion of the wider
                        possibilities of trade and pointed out to me with considerable force and
                        persuasiveness that the U.S. was at a big disadvantage with respect to
                        trading opportunities with the Soviet Union simply because the Soviet
                        official representing the American Division in all discussions was always
                            <pb n="848" xml:id="pg_848" facs="0876"/>at a disadvantage in Moscow
                        when it came time to share out to foreign countries parts of the purchase
                        programs authorized by higher authorities in Soviet economic planning. The
                        official from the American Division almost always had to say that he could
                        not guarantee delivery or terms, and under Soviet processes such uncertain
                        bargains were seldom interesting.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador returned at the end of the meal to the question of the new
                        President's personal style, and I repeated what I had said earlier about
                        continuity and about the President's commitment to peace. I also explained
                        that this President, like President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, used both written papers and oral discussions, but
                        in somewhat different proportions. I emphasized the new President's skill in
                        seeking and weighing the opinions of many different individuals, and the
                        Ambassador said that the new President's method sounded to him very much
                        like that of Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                    <p>We parted with a final toast to peace. On the whole this was the most
                        searching and instructive conversation I have yet had with a Soviet
                        diplomat. Somewhere in the middle of lunch, we switched from formal address
                        to first names.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Halaby began his report with reference to the fact that he is faced with
                        a regular monthly press conference and a request for a <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> interview in the near future. Therefore, he
                        desired to receive the Secretary's views and guidance at this time.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Halaby reported that after discussions with Soviet officials<note n="2" xml:id="d389fn2"> Halaby visited the Soviet Union December 8-18.
                            Memoranda of his conversations with <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> on December 13 and with Loginov on December 17
                            were transmitted as enclosures to airgrams A-837, December 17, and
                            A-876, December 24. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 1 US-
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and ORG 7 FAA)</note> he has
                        found that there are no known insurmountable technical or operational
                        obstacles to the New York-Moscow service which cannot be resolved either by
                        us or by the Soviets. He found to his surprise that the Soviets intend to
                        use the very large and out-dated TU-114 to initiate the service instead of
                        the more modern four-jet Ilyushin-62. Mr. Halaby confirmed that he himself
                        had flown the 114. He found that it has a serious noise problem and poses
                        significant traffic control problems in the high-speed tight Idlewild
                        landing patterns. However, the Soviets indicated to him that they are aware
                        of our noise standards and can do such things as modify the propellers on
                        the 114 if necessary.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> inquired about
                        the teletype line envisaged in the Air Agreement for service messages
                        between two air lines. Mr. Halaby said that Aeroflot indicated there would
                        be no problem establishing the line as provided in the Agreement. They
                        specified, however, that such a line would be limited to transmitting
                        operational messages for the air service.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked what attitudes Mr. Halaby encountered toward the Air
                        Agreement. Were technical people, for example, strongly interested in the
                        Agreement. Mr Halaby responded that he found great interest among the Soviet
                        officials with whom he spoke. He added that this was a little hard to
                        understand since in any genuine competition in this field they would clearly
                        be at a disadvantage. The Secretary said that the Soviets undoubtedly
                        believe that it might assist them in their efforts to fly to other
                        countries. He added that the Soviets will have to give something to the
                        Danes and others in order to secure overflight privileges. “We want to stay
                        out of this situation. That's their problem, not ours.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Halaby explained that the service is scheduled to be non- stop but
                        provides for four emergency points: at Shannon, Prestwick, Gander and Oslo.
                        He continued that in accordance with his instructions he had laid out a
                        schedule for technical talks before Aeroflot officials. However, three days
                        later General Loginov responded that there would be no further technical
                        talks until the bilateral agreement was formally signed. Under questioning
                        Loginov indicated they estimate that four months would be required to
                        complete technical preparations prior to service. <pb n="850" xml:id="pg_850" facs="0878"/>Mr. Halaby explained that this is a minimal
                        figure and that six months might be more realistic. Thus, it was determined
                        in Moscow that if service is to begin this summer it would be necessary to
                        sign the Air Agreement in January or February.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Halaby then discussed the Soviet officials with whom he met, explaining
                        that Loginov is equivalent to the FAA, <gloss target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss>,
                        and airline presidents all wrapped up in one person. Mr. Dementiev, Chairman
                        of the Committee for Aviation Production, is the equivalent of Mr. Webb,
                        Harold Brown <note n="3" xml:id="d389fn3"> James E. Webb, Administrator of
                            the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and Harold Brown,
                            Director of Defense Research and Engineering.</note> and several other
                        figures. Mr. Halaby added that Dementiev had proposed a series of visits by
                        Soviet civil aviation engineers to the United States and that such proposals
                        are now being framed for negotiation within the cultural exchange
                        negotiations beginning next month. In response to the Secretary's question,
                        Mr. Halaby affirmed that the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs was
                        represented at all his talks by Second Secretary Davydov of the American
                        Section.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated that the timing of the signature of the Agreement and
                        technical talks is important. If, for example, we were to lay our prestige
                        on the line in signing the Agreement and then have the air services break
                        down on technical grounds, this would be a serious problem for us. Mr.
                        Halaby agreed, adding that it also would pose problems for the FAA in the
                        form of pressure to issue an operation certificate to the Soviets as quickly
                        as possible. He recalled that there is a precedent for such difficulties in
                        the form of a <gloss target="#t_BEA1">BEA</gloss>-Aeroflot agreement which
                        was delayed two years after signature because of a noise factor in the
                        Soviet aircraft. Mr. Halaby also pointed out that the TU-114 now flies
                        internally, but only to Havana and New Delhi in foreign countries.</p>
                    <p>Each time he talked to Soviet officials, Mr. Halaby said, he always stressed
                        that the Air Agreement is only one facet of the general question of
                        accessibility or communication. He would refer to air corridors into Berlin,
                        the need for a direct tie-line between our Embassy and Washington for
                        telegraphic traffic, and access between consular representatives and
                        American citizens in the Soviet Union. Soviet officials usually listened
                        without comment, he added, but Deputy Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> insisted these subjects are all
                        separate. In response to the Secretary's question, Mr. Halaby stated that
                        there is nothing concrete in the Air Agreement regarding access to citizens
                        except in the form of a provision for search and rescue in the event of a
                        crash. He explained that the present agreement consists of the agreement
                        itself, a technical agreed minute, and an agreement between Aeroflot and Pan
                        American. The Secretary suggested that the latter should include a specific
                        provision on access to citizens such as <gloss target="#t_PAA1">PAA</gloss>
                        personnel. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> added
                            <pb n="851" xml:id="pg_851" facs="0879"/>that he felt we should only go
                        ahead with the Air Agreement if we get either a leased line or consular
                        convention including our requirement on consular access and
                        notification.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ferguson introduced the problem of the effect of the Agreement on United
                        States interests in other areas, particularly in Latin America. The
                        Secretary stated that these factors have all been considered and we have
                        decided on balance that we should go ahead with the Air Agreement. He asked
                        Mr. Halaby whether the Soviets have any impression that they will be able to
                        fly on to Havana from New York. Mr. Halaby responded no, that it seems to be
                        clear in their minds that such would not be the case. He then recounted the
                        background of the distortion of this point by the Baltimore Sun and
                        summarized his explanation to the President as to why the FAA follows the
                        navigation of Aeroflot flights to Havanna. The Secretary opined that it is
                        logical to keep track of Soviet aircraft off our coast and questioned
                        whether the Soviets do not now have the right to make emergency landings in
                        the United States during these flights. Mr Halaby confirmed that they do and
                        that our airfield at Charleston, South Carolina, has been alerted for the
                        possibility.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated that we will aim at signing the Air Agreement but not
                        before February. He asked Mr. Halaby whether he owed a response of any kind
                        to his opposite numbers in the U.S.S.R. Mr. Halaby explained that no action
                        is necessary now with Aeroflot and that Dementiev's exchange proposals are
                        being handled in the cultural exchanges negotiations.</p>
                    <p>In response to Mr. Halaby's question, the Secretary advised him to make the
                        following points in his press conference:</p>
                    <p>1. He had visited Moscow to hold technical discussions with his opposite
                        numbers.</p>
                    <p>2. He has found that technical problems for Moscow-New York service could be
                        worked out but that several details remain.</p>
                    <p>3. He has made a full report on his trip to the Secretary and to the
                        President.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLEJ1">Thompson</persName> suggested Mr.
                        Halaby play down the results of his visit in order to avoid promoting the
                        impression that the signing of the Agreement is imminent. The Secretary
                        commented that as so often with the Soviets broad agreements break down over
                        technical considerations. He recalled General Marshall's advice never to
                        make arrangements in principle with the Soviets, but always in detail.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Halaby summarized by saying the fact the Soviets would have established
                        organized flights to New York would inevitably mean that they will not send
                        their planes to New York empty. There will be 14,000 seats a year in their
                        aircraft. Secondly, he pointed out that in a US-Soviet competition in this
                        field of civil aviation we have a clear superiority. In short, he concluded,
                        this provides an opportunity to use the airplane for <pb n="852" xml:id="pg_852" facs="0880"/>its intended purposes. The Secretary
                        agreed, saying that “I would like to see us get ahead with this.”</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> called on me this
                        morning, at his request, to tell me that he had been thinking about our
                        recent conversation<note n="2" xml:id="d390fn2">
                            <ref target="#d388">Document 388</ref>.</note> and had some ideas which
                        he wished to share with me as a result. He reminded me that we had discussed
                        in a non-committal way the possibility that at some time in the future there
                        might be a meeting between the President and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, and he said that he now wished
                        to give me his own further reflections on this matter. He then drew out of
                        his pocket two sheets of handwriting and read a statement which I summarize
                        below.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that on reflection he believed it would add to the
                        possibility of mutual understanding, and would therefore be useful, if the
                        President and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                        could hold a meeting. Such a meeting would allow them to become more closely
                        acquainted and this acquaintanceship could be of positive importance because
                        of the responsibilities which they carry as the leaders of the two greatest
                        powers in the world. The Ambassador believed that such a meeting would be
                        useful if it merely resulted in a better acquaintance between these two
                        world leaders. The Ambassador expressed his opinion that in this respect the
                        meeting in Vienna could now be seen, with the passage of time, to have had
                        real value.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that of course it would be even better if such a meeting
                        could have concrete results. We were both familiar of course with the range
                        of the problems before us and they could all be discussed, and the Soviet
                        Government would welcome solutions even to the largest problems, but if the
                        United States did not think that the time was right for such larger
                        settlements, which was his impression, then perhaps there could be study of
                        one or more similar matters which might be more ready for settlement.</p>
                    <pb n="853" xml:id="pg_853" facs="0881"/>
                    <p>The Ambassador thought it would be helpful to know whether the U.S. thought
                        there were such problems, and what they might be, and what American proposal
                        for agreement there might be. He was sure that any suggestions would be
                        carefully studied in Moscow.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador repeated his view that with or without specific agreements a
                        meeting would be useful. He said that he well understood that such a meeting
                        could not well take place after June or July because of the election in the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the Ambassador said that in his view it was an open question as to
                        who should take the initiative, and he said he was confident that if it were
                        felt more convenient by the U.S. the initiative could easily be taken by
                        Moscow.</p>
                    <p>I told the Ambassador that I was very much interested in his reflections and
                        would engage in some reflection of my own and would communicate with him
                        reasonably soon. I told him that one thought which did occur to me was that
                        if there were to be any meeting in which no agreements were likely to be
                        registered, it would be important not to create false hopes on either side.
                        The Ambassador responded by saying that he thought it would be possible and
                        desirable, in the event that such a meeting was held, that there should be
                        an understanding between the governments as to their own view of its purpose
                        and meaning, and that this view should then be communicated to the
                        press.</p>
                    <p>In order to avoid giving the impression that I thought no agreements were
                        possible, I added that I thought it would be very useful for both sides to
                        review the possibilities for both small and large agreements. I said that I
                        thought the Ambassador should understand that the U.S. was in fact ready for
                        even the largest kinds of agreements, and regretted that on larger issues
                        the Soviet Government still seemed to be urging solutions which did not seem
                        workable to us. The Ambassador grinned, and we then turned to a discussion
                        of the New Year, which is being celebrated in an imaginative way at the
                        Soviet Embassy; the party begins at midnight Moscow time and continues until
                        midnight American time.<note n="3" xml:id="d390fn3">
