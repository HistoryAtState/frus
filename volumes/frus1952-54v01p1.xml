                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>
                    constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States. The
                    volumes in the series include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                    documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy
                    decisions of the United States together with appropriate materials concerning
                    the facts which contributed to the formulation of policies. Documents in the
                    files of the Department of State are supplemented by papers from other
                    government agencies involved in the formulation of foreign policy.</p>
                <p>The basic documentary diplomatic record printed in the volumes of the series <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> is edited by the
                    Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Department of State. The
                    editing is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and in accordance
                    with the following official guidance first promulgated by Secretary of State
                    Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925.</p>
                <p>There may be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating where in
                    the text the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose of
                    concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                    policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the
                    following reasons: <list>

                    declassification decisions, and obtains the clearance of geographic and
                    functional bureaus of the Department of State, as well as of other appropriate
                    agencies of the government. The Center, in coordination with the geographic
                    bureaus of the Department of State, conducts communications with foreign
                    governments regarding documents or information of those governments proposed for
                    inclusion in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes.</p>
                <p>Fredrick Aandahl supervised the initial planning of this volume. William Z.
                    Slany, his successor as General Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series, directed the process of compilation, review, and
                    editing, with the assistance of Ralph R. Goodwin and N. Stephen Kane. John P.
                    Glennon and Paul Claussen provided subsequent review and were responsible for
                    the final stages of publication.</p>
                <p>The following members of the Office of the Historian prepared sections of this
                    volume: N. Stephen Kane (general foreign economic policy, international monetary
                    and financial policy, transportation and communication policy); William F.
                    Sanford, Jr. (international trade and commercial policy, foreign investment and
                    economic development); Lisle A. Rose (foreign policy aspects of administrative
                    transition, foreign assistance policies under the Mutual Security Program,
                    Congressional loyalty and security investigations, Antarctica); David M. Baehler
                    (economic defense); Ronald D. Landa (antitrust legislation, the Bricker
                    Amendment); Herbert A. Fine (law of the sea); and Ilana M. Stern (immigration
                    and migration). David H. Stauffer and, at a later stage, Nina J. Noring assisted
                    in the clearance of this volume. Carmen Medina and Bret D. Bellamy provided
                    research assistance and support.</p>

                <p>The principal source of documentation for this volume was the indexed central

                    were supplemented by materials from Department of State “lot” files (retired

                    <p>I went over with the President the matter of the urgent need for liaison with
                        the incoming Administration. I mentioned the topics listed in Mr. Nitze’s
                            memorandum<note n="2" xml:id="d1fn2">The reference memorandum cannot be
                            further identified.</note> as some of the instances where we were being
                        forced daily to make decisions with which the next Administration would have
                        to live and the resulting need for consultation with them.</p>
                    <p>I reminded the President that Mr. Lovett had already spoken about a similar
                        need in the Defense Department and I felt sure that the same situation
                        existed in the Treasury. The President thoroughly agreed and told me that he
                        had already sent a telegram to General Eisenhower asking him to appoint a
                        liaison officer to work with the Bureau of the Budget on the budget which
                        would have to go to Congress not later than January 18. He showed me a
                        telegram from General Eisenhower accepting this suggestion.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d1fn3">Neither telegram has been found in Department of State
                            files.</note></p>
                    <p>The President then went over with me another telegram which he will send to
                        General Eisenhower and release this afternoon asking the General to meet
                        with him in the White House in the next few days to arrange the broader
                        question of liaison and the transfer of power from this Administration to

                            arranged for sometime during the week of Nov. 17. The texts of both the

                    <p>On November 7, 1952, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Executive Secretary
                        James S. Lay, Jr., submitted to the National Security Council a three-volume
                        study entitled “Current Policies of the Government of the United States of
                        America Relating to National Security.” In a covering memorandum, he stated
                        that “These volumes have been assembled for the information of the President
                        and the President-elect in order to present briefly the current policies of
                        the United States relating to the national security as approved by the
                        President upon the advice of or acting with the National Security Council.”
                        He also noted that all statements on policy implementation had been formally
                        coordinated “at the working level within and between the departments and
                        agencies responsible for their implementation, but they cannot be considered
                        as cleared, formal, or complete statements.” The three-volume study is in
                        the Truman Library, Truman papers, <gloss target="#t_PSF1"

                        <item>Mr. Bruce reported that Senator Lodge<note n="2" xml:id="d4fn2"
                                >Representative-designate of the United States to the United
                                Nations.</note> will be in Washington tomorrow. Mr. Bruce plans to
                            talk with the Senator either this weekend or the first of next week. At
                            the present time it is difficult to determine how Senator Lodge will
                            want to establish liaison arrangements with State.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Thorp pointed out that there are two kinds of problems involved.
                            One type includes problems which require immediate decisions prior to
                            January 20. The other type is the group of problems which are not ready
                            for a decision now but which a new Administration should study as soon
                            as possible. He cited the reciprocal trade agreements act as an example
                            and pointed out that the new Administration needs to do some thinking on
                            this problem at an early date. Mr. Bruce pointed out that the most
                            important problems, such as Korea, Iran, <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>, etc., will be covered by briefing material for the
                            Tuesday meeting between President Truman and President-elect
                                Eisenhower.<note n="3" xml:id="d4fn3">See the memorandum of the
                                meeting at the White House between the President and General

                            Unless Senator Lodge is prepared to organize a staff to go into the
                            various departments, we could not do much more than this at the present
                            time. Mr. Bruce felt that the arrangement with Lodge was a temporary
                            one, but we must first find out what he has in mind before we begin
                            preparation of materials. Mr. Nitze felt that on problems other than the
                            most urgent ones, initiative should come from Senator Lodge for
                            information or consultation.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Johnson stated that Joseph Dodge<note n="4" xml:id="d4fn4"
                                >Director-designate of the Budget.</note> has told him that he has
                            been instructed by Eisenhower to merely observe and not to agree or
                            disagree with decisions being made by the present Administration. Mr.
                            Bruce stated that we will tell Senator Lodge that we will cooperate any
                            way possible. He stated that it will depend to a considerable extent on
                            whether Senator Lodge has a staff, whether he operates in the State
                            Department, whether we furnish the staff for him, and many other
                            factors.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Sandifer stated that there was a ticker report yesterday which
                            indicated that President-elect Eisenhower will see Senator Wiley the
                            week of November 25. The report suggested that Senator Wiley would be
                            used as the channel on consultation for the new Administration on <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> problems. Mr. Bruce pointed out that the
                            President will deal directly with Eisenhower on some of the major <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> problems, but it was Eisenhower’s
                            prerogative to designate any person he desired for liaison
                            arrangements.</item>

                        <item>Mr. Riddleberger suggested that there was a third category of problems
                            and those would include decisions which are being made now but not of
                            major importance. Action on some of these will have been completed by
                            January for submission to the next Congress. He stated that the debt
                            conference was a problem in this category. Mr. Bruce pointed out that
                            the present Administration could not abdicate its responsibilities and
                            would have to continue to operate. He asked that Mr. Riddleberger
                            furnish him a memorandum on the subject of the debt conference.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Miller stated that there were problems which require immediate
                            attention in the Latin American area but are not of sufficient
                            importance to warrant Senator Lodge’s personal attention. These problems
                            are important for Mr. Miller’s successor. He stated that the
                            Inter-American Economic Conference scheduled for February 9 is one in
                            this category.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Bruce suggested that all of the offices of the Department should
                            prepare a description of the problems which the new Administration will
                            be facing soon after January 20. These descriptions, as well as a
                            listing of all problems which are not of such immediate importance,
                            should be submitted to Mr. McWilliams. The memoranda should be prepared
                            in two parts: (a) a description of the problems which the new
                            Administration will face during the first two months of office; and (b)
                            a list of problems which the new Administration will face during the
                            remaining part of the fiscal year.</item>

                        United Nations forces and other members of his command. I also hope to the
                        extent practicable to visit the troops of the United States, the Republic of
                        Korea and the many other nations, composing the United Nations Command, all
                        of whom have fought so long and so valiantly for the vital principles at
                        stake in that struggle. I also hope to see President Rhee and other members
                        of the Government of the Republic of Korea whose land is being defended
                        against this most brutal and callous aggression.</p>

                            long ago as April last, the Annual Review has progressed slowly and
                            there is now a very serious question whether even the most limited
                            objectives of the Review can be accomplished at the December 15 meeting.
                            These limited objectives are (1) agreement on firm force goals for
                            calendar 1953, including maintenance thereof, and (2) some indication,
                            however sketchy, of provisional 1954 goals. Agreement on the former is
                            obviously necessary at the earliest possible moment because 1953 is
                            almost upon us and Government programs, including United States aid
                            programs, must be established in order to place contracts and determine
                            shipments of equipment. The latter is most desirable from the U.S.
                            viewpoint in order to provide a sound basis for the request to Congress
                            for fiscal <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0041"/>’54 appropriations for
                            defense support, end-item assistance and offshore procurement for the

                        <p>A recent telegram from our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            Representatives in Paris reported a meeting of the Annual Review
                            Committee which broke up early in the morning of November 11 after hours
                            of wrangling over a proposal by the International Staff which proposed
                            that at the December 15 meeting there should be only an interim report
                            on 1953 force goals. Analyzing the situation, Ambassador Merchant
                            reported: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It is my considered opinion that given extent of active and
                                    passive resistance in other delegations and the lack of
                                    leadership in the International Staff, we cannot now achieve for
                                    consideration by the Ministers December 15th [meeting] an Annual
                                    Review report containing anything resembling firm force goals
                                    for 1953.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Mr. Merchant’s analysis and its conclusions were concurred in by senior
                            staff officers from Washington who have been in Paris the last several
                            weeks for the critical stages of the Annual Review process. As a
                            consequence of these recent developments, we are probably faced with the
                            alternatives of a December 15 meeting at which little can be done on the
                            Annual Review, or no meeting at all until the earliest feasible date in
                            1953. The Chairman of the North Atlantic Council, namely Mr. Kraft,
                            Foreign Minister of Denmark, has called a meeting in New York for
                            November 14 of those <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Foreign
                            Ministers who are currently there for the General Assembly. Out of this
                            meeting should come the answer as to whether there is to be a December
                            15 meeting or not.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. What Could be Accomplished at Such
                                a Meeting?</hi></p>
                        <p>The current position of the United States is that if the other <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries desire a December 15
                            meeting we will acquiesce. However, it is not at all clear as to which
                            Cabinet ministers from the United States would be in attendance and this
                            depends upon what kind of meeting the Ministers in New York agree to
                            hold. The United States successfully resisted efforts to hold a
                            Ministerial meeting in late September or October on the grounds that
                            during the election campaign there were obvious difficulties which would
                            have made it impracticable for the United States to participate. We
                            therefore strongly supported the December 15 date for a meeting
                            primarily focused on the relatively limited objectives related to 1953,
                            for most of which financial provision has already been made in the
                            fiscal 1953 budget. In taking this position, we recognized also that it
                            would be difficult for a new Administration to take responsibility for a
                            Ministerial meeting early in the new year.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the fall the United States has at all times been insistent on
                            the necessity for establishing firm goals for ’53 at the December <pb
                                n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0042"/>15 meeting. This pressure has
                            been carried to the point where Ambassador Merchant has now been obliged
                            to report that it is being increasingly resented. More generally also,
                            our position must take account of general European attitudes which in
                            recent months have been less favorable to the United States for a
                            variety of reasons such as (1) the increasing unpopularity of an
                            expensive rearmament program at a time when the Soviet threat, in
                            European eyes at least, seems less acute, (2) the stationary or
                            declining standard of living of certain major classes in Europe as
                            contrasted with continued advances here, (3) European worries that the
                            United States is preparing more to win a war against the USSR than to
                            prevent a war, (4) resentment of legislative conditions attached to U.S.
                            aid, (5) growing dissatisfaction with continued dependence on the United
                            States, and (6) irritations at the multiplicity of U.S.
                            officials—civilian and military—in Europe.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances, if, as seems probable, the other <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners desire to go through with
                            the December 15 meeting, we shall probably have to make the best of it.
                            Apart from routine business, of which there is a fair amount, such a
                            meeting might be made to serve a useful purpose in connection with
                            several other problems. Even if there can be no agreement on ’53 force
                            goals, the attention given to the 1953 buildup could be made to
                            demonstrate once more the necessity of obtaining German rearmament at
                            the earliest possible moment. As this can only be achieved following
                            ratification of the <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> Treaty, and as
                            France has been reluctant to face up to ratification, the meeting would
                            serve to bring indirect pressure upon the French. Furthermore, to the
                            degree that such pressure is effective, it would serve to promote the
                            policy of European integration which has such strong bipartisan support
                            in the United States.</p>
                        <p>Also, even though it may be decided that no decisions can be taken on the
                            Annual Review, it should still be possible for Ministers to give a
                            strong impetus in December to the <gloss target="#t_AR1">AR</gloss>
                            process. One of the main difficulties being faced, on the basis of the
                            country submissions thus far, is how to get the European countries to
                                <hi rend="italic">reduce</hi> their proposed force plans, which
                            apart from those of the U.K. are generally unrealistic in terms of
                            standards by which readiness of forces is measured, support requirements
                            for troops and reserves of equipment.</p>
                        <p>Apart from the foregoing, there would be approved by the Ministers at
                            Paris a new <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> study of Soviet
                            foreign policy, which should help in laying the basis for the continued
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> effort. There will also be
                            ready for approval a new “Strategic Guidance” prepared by the Standing
                            Group which would aid in bringing up to date common <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> planning.</p>
                        <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0043"/>
                        <p>While it is being argued whether a meeting without substantial
                            accomplishment on the Annual Review would provoke a better or worse
                            public reaction than a cancellation of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> meeting, the preponderant view at the moment is that
                            the loss of momentum, sense of failure and public disillusionment would
                            be worse in the event of an outright cancellation of the meeting. This
                            is all the more true if it can be established in advance that, as
                            contemplated by the Lisbon meeting, <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> Ministers’ meetings do not necessarily have to lead to
                            spectacular achievement each time but should rather be accepted as
                            normal periodic meetings of the nations of the Atlantic Community to
                            discuss their common problems.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">3. When Should There Be a Second
                                Meeting?</hi></p>
                        <p>It is obvious from what has been written above that the date and nature
                            of the next meeting will be greatly influenced by the events of the next
                            several days. If, as seems almost certain, there can be no agreement on
                            firm force goals for ’53 at the December 15 meeting, it will be
                            necessary to hold a second meeting for this purpose at the earliest date
                            which is practicable for the new Administration. The first of March
                            would be in that event a most desirable target both from the standpoint
                            of U.S. budgetary submissions to Congress and from the standpoint of the
                            firming up of the 1953 effort of our other <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> partners.</p>
                        <p>Apart from the early 1953 meeting required to conclude the Annual Review,
                            there will be need for at least one other meeting which might take place
                            during the fall. This meeting would conclude the Annual Review for 1953.
                            In connection with this, it has for long been contemplated that 1953
                            would be a year of general reassessment of the progress of the
                            coalition, and of the composition and size of future <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces. At the present time studies
                            are in progress at <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> to determine
                            the effect of new weapons and new tactics for their use upon future
                            military requirements. This study, which is awaited eagerly by our
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners in hopes that it may
                            ease their burdens, should be ready by next summer. At the moment, it
                            has been generally realized that the effects of new weapons development
                            are not likely to affect the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            buildup materially before 1956 at the earliest and would begin to show a
                            substantial effect only later. With <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> forces still inadequate, the limited degree of
                            additional buildup which can be achieved in 1953 and 1954 will be
                            required in any event.</p>
                        <p>The autumn-1953 meeting would also have to face up to another major
                            policy problem arising from the fact that we have now reached the point
                            in building up modern forces where maintenance and replacement becomes
                            an important and costly problem. Much of the modern equipment has been
                            provided or financed by the <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0044"
                            />United States, and the incidence of replacement costs will become a
                            pressing question next year. This in turn is related to consideration of
                            whether the present forms of aid programs are to continue, or whether
                            the continuing dollar gap in Europe and inadequate productivity there is
                            to be combatted by other means, including the adoption of new United
                            States economic policies. This meeting too will be awaited by the
                            Europeans with particular concern as providing one of the first
                            indications of the considered attitude of the new Administration towards
                            the problems of Europe and the continued association of the United
                            States with Europe for mutual security purposes. In fact, it is quite
                            possible that because of this consideration the other <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries will press for an earlier
                            interim meeting in the late spring to review progress, deal with
                            political and economic questions and pave the way for the completion in
                            the autumn of the 1953 Annual Review.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">1. The President and General Eisenhower
                            Alone</hi></p>
                    <p>The President might begin by setting forth his general reasons for suggesting
                        the meeting: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Under our Constitutional System we have the periodic problem of a
                                break in continuity of political authority and the continuing nature
                                of the foreign policy problems which the Government faces.</p>
                            <p>The Constitution leaves the power and obligations of the presidential
                                office on the out-going President until the inauguration of his
                                successor. It does not permit the President to turn his powers over
                                to another until he leaves office.</p>
                            <p>Any President-elect feels reluctant to be fastened with any of the
                                political responsibilities of the office before taking on the legal
                                powers as well.</p>
                            <p>In reviewing the experience with the problems of changing over
                                Administrations, running back to 1796–97, it is clear that the
                                pattern <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0045"/>has varied with the
                                attitude of the men concerned and with the prevailing situation in
                                domestic and foreign politics.</p>
                            <p>This time there are particular differences from past experience.</p>
                            <p>One of these differences results from the recent 21st Amendment
                                which: <list>
                                    <item>Shortens the time for the old Administration to wind up
                                        its affairs and the new Administration to get ready,</item>
                                    <item>Eliminates the short-session of the Congress as an
                                        opportunity for a retiring Administration to wind up its
                                        legislative program,</item>
                                    <item>Eliminates the nine-month lag between the arrival of a new
                                        Administration and the convening of the new Congress.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>The second and principal difference arises from the world
                                situation—the scope and the urgency of the problems in foreign
                                affairs. This last makes this meeting necessary. The President then
                                might emphasize these points:</p>
                            <p>This Administration does not expect the new Administration to take on
                                responsibilities prematurely.</p>
                            <p>On some emerging issues giving other nations assurance of the
                                continuity of our policy might prove essential to success in our
                                undertakings. In such cases it would obviously be good to have the
                                concurrence of the new Administration. This, however, is something
                                beyond the power of the present Administration to determine. In any
                                such instance it would welcome concurrence but it would not press
                                for it. It is realized that this is a matter on which the next
                                President must make up his own mind.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The President might then say that he has invited the Secretaries of State,
                        Defense and Treasury to join him and the General, but before they do so he
                        would like to mention the subject of atomic energy.</p>
                    <p>The President may wish to explain to the President-elect that <hi

                        the problems which will require attention in the coming months is the
                        complex of relations with the United Kingdom and Canada and the several raw
                        material supplying countries, in the field of atomic energy. On the military
                        side there is the specific question whether, and in what way, military
                        information concerning atomic weapons should be shared with the <gloss

                    <p>The President could then say that the Chairman of the Atomic Energy

                    <p>The President might next make clear the following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>General Eisenhower’s responsiveness in selecting Mr. Joseph M. Dodge
                                and Senator Lodge to perform liaison functions with this

                            <p>The Administration wants to do all it can to make this liaison
                                helpful to the incoming Administration—to fill in the background on
                                current problems, to make facilities available for informing the new

                        which status reports are appropriate at this time. The President might well
                        emphasize that the Korean problem in particular, in regard to the prisoner
                        repatriation issue, is one in which the prospect that the next

                    <p>The President also stated that he and General Eisenhower had had a private
                        conversation before coming into the Cabinet Room.</p>
                    <p>General Eisenhower asked whether the President would give him memoranda of
                        these conversations. The President replied that he would.<note n="2"

                            describes this 20-minute session in <hi rend="italic">Years of Trial and

                    <p>The President said that there were some pressing matters which he thought it
                        was important for General Eisenhower to be informed about, and which he
                        asked Secretary Acheson to take up.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Acheson said he would speak about a number of pressing matters where
                        action was called for each day which would have important effects in the
                        weeks and months following January 20, 1953. He would not speak about all
                        such matters, but pick out the most important, in part for the information
                        which the statement would contain, and also as illustrations of the
                        necessity for expanding <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0050"/>the liaison
                        between the Administrations already provided. He hoped that his remarks
                        would underline the importance of having an increasing number of officers
                        who would exercise responsibility after January 20 attached by the new
                        Administration to the various Departments, so that they might be familiar
                        with the developing situations for which they would have responsibility very
                        soon. He said that, as the President had pointed out, this did not involve
                        the assumption of responsibility, since these officers might or might not
                        express any views on current matters. However, they would be informed about
                        them and would have the opportunity to express any views which the new
                        Administration wished to express.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Korea.</hi> A most serious situation was developing in
                        New York. The debate with Vishinsky had ended in a very general acceptance
                        of the idea that force should not be used to make prisoners return. Even
                        Vishinsky was not willing to espouse the opposite principle. The course
                        taken by the neutralist nations—India and Indonesia, etc.—was to circumvent
                        this principle. In this they were strongly supported by the Canadians and
                        British, and now had the support of the French and some others. The method
                        of circumvention was very simple. The prisoners were to be turned over to a
                        Commission. The Commission was not to use force on the prisoners, but the
                        Commission was to repatriate the prisoners, and these men were to remain
                        prisoners until repatriated. If the prisoners were not repatriated in three
                        months they were to be turned over to a Political Conference which would
                        undoubtedly continue the same process. The attempt here was to accept the
                        words of the principle and still keep the result desired by the
                        Communists—that is, the repatriation of the prisoners. The prisoners had no
                        exit from captivity under the Commission except to be repatriated.</p>
                    <p>Certain clear results would flow from such a proposal if it were adopted. In
                        the first place, we would obviously in the view of the entire world have
                        repudiated our own principle. The circumvention was clear and obvious to
                        all. In the second place, we would undoubtedly be called upon to use force
                        against the prisoners to turn them over to a Commission, which, although it
                        did not use force, would keep them in captivity until they returned home. In
                        the third place, we would have a most precarious armistice, with the
                        possibility of grave trouble arising in the prison camps. The Army would be
                        deprived of all observation over enemy lines, of power to break up
                        concentrations and to work over supply lines, and it would be unable
                        properly to deploy the forces in the Command. The Communists would be free
                        to rehabilitate air fields in North Korea. At any moment we might be charged
                        with violating the armistice <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0051"/>because
                        the proposal regarding the prisoners was unclear and unworkable and almost
                        certain to lead to misunderstandings.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, the situation in New York called for the most energetic action on
                        the United States side to defeat or alter this attempted circumvention of
                        the principle. This involved keeping aligned with us the British, French,
                        and others. There was obviously a showdown coming. The attitude of the
                        President and his Cabinet advisers was clear upon it. Therefore, if there
                        were to be yielding, it could only be by those who were attempting to put
                        through this new idea.</p>
                    <p>The debate would begin tomorrow, Wednesday. Voting on proposals might come as
                        early as Saturday, but more probably next week. Any statement on this
                        matter, supporting the view held by this Government, by General Eisenhower
                        would be of the greatest possible assistance. The Secretary had prepared the
                        sort of statement which would provide this assistance, and he handed it to
                        Senator Lodge. (See attached statement)<note n="4" xml:id="d8fn4">Attachment
                            2 below.</note></p>
                    <p>The Secretary also stated that he had informed the British, Canadians, and
                        French that any division between them and us on this essential matter would
                        have the gravest consequences here in the United States, through
                        disillusionment regarding collective security. The consequences would not be
                        confined to Korea, but would also have implications in <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and other arrangements of the same
                        sort.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Iran.</hi> Another situation had developed to a critical
                        point. This was the dispute between Iran and the United Kingdom over oil. We
                        had been trying for a year and a half to find a fair solution which would
                        provide compensation for the British and allow oil to flow from Iran and
                        funds to come to Iran. Both parties had been wholly unreasonable, but in
                        different senses of the word. The Iranians were unreasonable in that they
                        were not activated by reason but by emotion. The British were unreasonable
                        in not seeming to understand this. They thought that by putting economic
                        pressure on Iranians they would act as reasonable people might under the
                        same circumstances. The result had been the opposite. The Iranians were more
                        concerned with freeing the oil from British control than they were in the
                        economic benefits which might come to them from the oil industry. This had
                        already led to economic difficulties, to very grave disintegration both
                        within the Iranian Government and within the Iranian social structure, and
                        to a political break with the British, who had been expelled from Iran.</p>
                    <p>We were informed by our Ambassador that if the Iranians managed their affairs
                        reasonably they might survive for as long as a <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26"
                            facs="0052"/>year without selling oil and without major external help.
                        However, they would not act reasonably in this situation. They would act
                        emotionally, perhaps in stages break altogether their relations with the
                        United States, discharge large numbers of public employees, who would add to
                        the unrest of that country, and in a very short time bring the country to a
                        state of chaos.</p>
                    <p>We were deeply disturbed at this prospect. The British seemed more concerned
                        about the consequences of a settlement which differed from their desires
                        because of the effects on British investments in other parts of the world.
                        This had led to a fundamental difference of view. Although we had been
                        working with the British for months, it seemed unlikely to us that
                        persuasion would result in any workable solution in time.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we were also going forward under the President’s
                        authority to consider what the United States alone might do to solve this
                        problem. It seemed unlikely to us, however, that it ever could be solved in
                        the face of determined British opposition. Without going into detail, the
                        reason for this conclusion was that Iran could only sell its oil in volume
                        in markets which would bring American distributors into violent competition
                        and conflict with British distributors. Therefore, some degree of British
                        cooperation was necessary. It seemed to him likely—although here he was
                        speculating—that this could only be done by a series of steps in which
                        American unilateral action was started and became apparent. Thereupon some
                        degree of British cooperation might be stimulated. He thought we would
                        probably have to proceed by jerks in this way, with some periods of
                        considerable bitterness.</p>
                    <p>It seemed to Secretary Acheson most important that the new Administration
                        should be closely in touch with this situation, because considerable
                        difficulties were likely to arise from it.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">European Defense.</hi> Here there were two problems of
                        immediate and critical importance to the new Administration.</p>
                    <p>The first was the meeting of the North Atlantic Council on December 15. The
                        other nations demanded it. It was not possible to make any great progress at
                        this meeting, because the material was not in usable shape. Countries had
                        submitted military programs for 1953 which far exceeded their stated
                        economic capacity. There could be only preliminary discussion of this
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>It would be necessary to have another and more definitive meeting at an early
                        date. The European countries have asked for February 15. The latest date
                        which seemed workable was March 1. Therefore, the new Administration must be
                        prepared to act promptly and with full information soon after it comes into
                        office. We had attempted to postpone the date as long as possible, but any
                            <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0053"/>substantial postponement would
                        defeat effective military progress in 1953.</p>
                    <p>The second critical matter related to the treaty with Germany and the
                        European Defense Community treaty.<note n="5" xml:id="d8fn5">For

                    <p>Until the recent outburst in France, we had hoped that these treaties would
                        be ratified toward the end of 1952 or at the latest in January or February
                        of 1953. The attack on the treaties in France had caused us worry, but we
                        still had thought that the difficulties might be surmounted with a little
                        more delay. Today, however, a most disturbing action occurred. As a result
                        of a press conference statement by Mr. Schuman, the Adenauer Government had
                        been defeated on a motion to take up the treaties on November 26. No date
                        was now set, and it was too early to estimate the full extent of this
                        action. It did seem probable, however, that we were now in a position where
                        there was jockeying between France and Germany as to who should act first,
                        with nobody being prepared to act until the new Administration came in. This
                        was not only serious in regard to the defense aspects of the situation, but
                        we might count on a very strong German reaction against continuing the
                        occupation and postponing the practical implementation of the treaty with
                        Germany. Therefore, we had a real crisis in Western European
                        collaboration.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Southeast Asia.</hi> We had been concerned for a long
                        time about the course of action in Indochina. There was a strong body of
                        opinion in France which regarded this as a lost cause that was bleeding
                        France both financially and by undermining the possibility of French-German
                        equality in European defense.</p>
                    <p>There had been a noticeable lack of French aggressive attitude from a
                        military point of view in Indochina. The central problem in Indochina was
                        the fence-sitting by the population. They would never come down on one side
                        or another until they had a reasonable assurance of who would be the victor
                        and that their interests would be served by the victor.</p>
                    <p>We were helping France to the extent of carrying between one-third and
                        one-half of the financial burden of the Indochinese war. We had had military
                        discussions between the five powers—the United States, United Kingdom,
                        France, Australia, and New Zealand—which had not been effective in devising
                        agreed military solutions against the contingency of overt Chinese
                        intervention in Indochina. The French now sought political discussions to
                        carry the matter forward.</p>
                    <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0054"/>
                    <p>This was an urgent matter upon which the new Administration must be prepared
                        to act.</p>
                    <p>All of the foregoing problems were involved in the survey which the President
                        had ordered made of the use of our resources in foreign aid. Mr. Joseph
                        Dodge indicated that he was familiar with this survey. Mr. Acheson stated
                        that it involved a study of the proper assignment of resources to foreign
                        aid as against domestic re-armament, of allocations between military and
                        economic assistance, of allocations between areas.</p>
                    <p>The growing unrest throughout North Africa and the Middle East raised
                        questions as to whether we had put proper amounts of our resources to work
                        in those areas.</p>
                    <p>We hoped this study would be pushed to conclusion before January 20. It was
                        essential for the new Administration to be familiar with it, since it
                        involved the entire foreign program.</p>
                    <p>5. The last item was the matter of United States foreign economic policy.
                        This did not relate solely to appropriations for foreign aid, but more
                        importantly to our economic and financial policy.</p>
                    <p>It seemed to us clear that the economic underpinning of the Western alliance
                        was too flimsy for safety. The slightest diminution of American aid or
                        American defense spending might produce economic consequences which might
                        seriously weaken the countries most closely associated with us. We had been
                        conducting studies in this field. A British Commonwealth Conference would
                        meet next week, which would come forward with very far-reaching proposals
                        involving American participation.</p>
                    <p>It was essential that early in 1953 the United States Government should have
                        carefully reviewed its foreign economic policy and be able to come forward
                        with one which gave some chance of stability to the Western world, and
                        particularly to our major allies. If that were not done, it seemed to Mr.
                        Acheson that a very large part of the foundations for a successful United
                        States foreign policy might be undermined.</p>
                    <p>General Eisenhower said that he would like a memorandum of what the Secretary
                        of State had said. He would give it careful study. He would also give
                        careful study to the suggested statement on Korea. He recognized the
                        seriousness and critical nature of the matters discussed.</p>
                    <p>General Eisenhower said that he was preparing immediately on the conclusion
                        of this meeting to go with Secretary Lovett to meet the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff for a military briefing. In view of this, both he and Mr. Lovett
                        thought that it was unnecessary to discuss any military matters.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Harriman said that he would not go into <gloss target="#t_MSA1"
                            >MSA</gloss> matters, because Mr. Dodge and others would be familiar
                        with them through <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0055"/>their budget work.
                        However, he strongly recommended that at an early date someone be
                        specifically designated to have liaison with <gloss target="#t_MSA1"
                            >MSA</gloss>. General Eisenhower agreed that this should be done.</p>
                    <p>General Eisenhower also said that he had an appointment to see Mr. Eden in
                        New York on Thursday and that, prior to seeing him, he would carefully
                        consider what Secretary Acheson had said regarding Korea.</p>
                    <p>The President and General Eisenhower then went over a draft joint statement
                        which had been prepared and with two changes adopted it. (Attached)<note

                        <p>In the Treasury Department there is a wide range of matters relating to
                            the financing of the Government and to the international position of the
                            United States which will confront the new Administration in the early
                            part of 1953. The matters involved include (1) the financial aspects of
                            United States transactions throughout the world, (2) the formulation of
                            a tax policy to recommend to the Congress, and (3) the management of the
                            public debt.</p>

                                field, the Treasury is responsible for the coordination of basic
                                financial policies, including those relating to the aid programs
                                administered by State, Defense, and the Mutual Security Agency. The
                                broad political and strategic aspects of foreign policy and national
                                security are to be presented by the State and Defense Departments.
                                Financial aspects of these subjects can be presented to the new
                                President’s financial advisers by the Treasury Department at a later
                                time. An important concern of the Treasury is the relationship of
                                international and domestic financial policies, including the impact
                                of the foreign aid programs on taxes and public debt management.
                                Moreover, the Treasury is responsible for the maintenance of the
                                value of the dollar abroad, the operation of our gold bullion
                                monetary standard, cooperation with other countries in foreign
                                exchange policy, and the administration of controls embargoing
                                financial transactions with Communist China. The Treasury is also

                                problem will relate to a number of defense tax increases, including
                                the excess profits tax, which are due to expire between June 30,
                                1953, and March 31, 1954. The new Administration will have to
                                formulate a tax program for recommendation to the Congress to meet
                                this situation. The importance of the problem is indicated by the
                                fact that the Government is operating at a deficit and the scheduled
                                tax expiration would reduce revenues by about $2 billion in the
                                fiscal year 1954 and by about $8 billion a year when the reductions
                                reach their full revenue effect.</item>

                                management, there is a $267 billion national debt created largely as
                                a result of World War II. Some of this debt will require refunding
                                during 1953. There will be new money to raise to finance the
                                Government deficit, if there is one in the calendar year 1953, and
                                to provide for seasonal cash requirements during periods in which
                                expenditures temporarily exceed receipts. There will also be
                                problems relating to the sales of savings bonds to individuals. It
                                is imperative that the savings bond program, which is a nation-wide
                                campaign of thrift, be continued and extended. There is also the
                                consideration of appropriate securities for various other investment

                        <p>The American people earnestly want peace in Korea. They insist, however,
                            on an honorable armistice. The armistice should be a clean and clear
                            armistice which settles all the military problems and leaves nothing to
                            chance or misconstruction.</p>
                        <p>Our prisoners of war in communist hands must be promptly returned.
                            Communist prisoners of war in our hands should be allowed to go home.
                            But it is clear to me that those who violently resist return to the
                            communists cannot be driven back. They cannot be held in indefinite
                            captivity. They must be released as free men.</p>
                        <p>I hope that the General Assembly of the United Nations will take a firm
                            stand on these matters.</p>

                        <p>President Truman and General Eisenhower met today at the White House.
                            After conferring together by themselves, they met with the Secretaries

                            General Eisenhower’s associates, Senator Lodge and Mr. Dodge.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the talks, the President and General Eisenhower issued the

                                <p>“We have discussed some of the most important problems affecting
                                    our country in the sphere of international relations.
                                    Information with respect to these problems has been made
                                    available to General Eisenhower.</p>
                                <p>“Under our Constitution the President must exercise his functions
                                    until he leaves office, and his successor cannot be asked to
                                    share or assume the responsibilities of the Presidency until he
                                    takes office.</p>
                                <p>“We have worked out a framework for liaison and exchange of
                                    information between the present Administration and the incoming
                                    Administration, but we have made no arrangements which are

                                <p>“We believe, however, that the arrangements we have made for
                                    cooperation will be of great value to the stability of our
                                    country and to the favorable progress of international
                                    affairs.</p>
                                <p>“We are confident that this meeting and that the arrangements we
                                    have made today for liaison and cooperation between the present
                                    Administration and the new Administration furnish additional

                    <p>I telephoned Mr. John Foster Dulles on the afternoon of December 19 after my
                        return from Paris,<note n="1" xml:id="d9fn1">Acheson had attended the Tenth

                        desirable for me to give him a full report of my talks in Paris with the
                        Foreign Ministers both in and out of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        meeting and of my impressions of the situations in both Germany and France
                        and of the present status of the ratification of <gloss target="#t_EDC1"
                            >EDC</gloss>. I made this call at the suggestion of Mr. Bruce, with whom
                        Mr. Dulles had discussed the proposal for the early appointment of a High
                        Commissioner to Germany. Apparently he had in mind the possibility of
                        appointing Mr. Robert Murphy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dulles mentioned to me over the telephone that he would like to hear what
                        I had to say before making an appointment and asked whether in the light of
                        my discussions in Paris I would think the man referred to above would be a
                        good appointment. I said that he was an excellent man, was doing an
                        extremely good job where he was, was badly needed there, and I thought would
                        not be so effective in Germany because of the great importance of
                        German-French relations and in view of the perhaps unfounded view in Paris
                        that Mr. Murphy was not sympathetic with the French. Mr. Dulles said that he
                        would be returning to Washington the following Wednesday; that no decision
                        was contemplated immediately; and that he would discuss the matter further
                        with me then.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dulles accordingly called upon me at the State Department on Wednesday
                        December 24. I showed him my report of my conversation with Monnet; told him
                        of the reports made to me by Reber and Debevoise and of the Chancellor’s
                        conviction that despite his <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0059"/>troubles
                        he would successfully surmount the court issue and would have the agreements
                        ratified by the Bundestag in January and by the Bundesrat in February.<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d9fn2">Reference is to the ratification by the Federal

                        my conversation with Pleven and Schuman regarding action by the French
                        Chamber following German ratification. I told him of the Chancellor’s desire
                        to have a High Commissioner appointed as soon as possible, who would be a
                        strong man with whom he could work on intimate terms. I also told him of the
                        Chancellor’s desire for some expression by the new Administration of its
                        support of <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> and that the latter should be
                        in the framework of European unity and not merely as a military matter. I
                        suggested that this might be done in a New Year’s message from General
                        Eisenhower to General Ridgway and his former comrades at <gloss
                            target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>, which need not stress the military
                        aspects, but could point out that they were part of a larger movement of
                        profound historic significance.</p>
                    <p>He said that he had been working on this and had talked with General
                        Eisenhower and Mr. McCloy. General Eisenhower’s belief was that his views
                        were so well known regarding his support for <gloss target="#t_EDC1"
                            >EDC</gloss> that it was unnecessary to repeat them. I stressed that
                        repetition was most important.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dulles then turned to the matter of the High Commissioner. He said that
                        they were now considering President Conant of Harvard and had had some talk
                        with him. He wished this to be kept very secret. I told Mr. Dulles of my
                        talks with Mr. Conant at the end of 1951 and of the difficulties which he
                        then had in leaving his present post on short notice. I did not know what
                        his present situation was. I also said that at one time Mr. Conant had had
                        grave doubts about any sort of rearmament of Germany and that this was a
                        matter which should be carefully explored, because such an attitude on the
                        part of the High Commissioner at a time when the Chancellor was in a very
                        bitter battle might be disastrous. He said that he would look into this.</p>
                    <p>I then informed Mr. Dulles of the status of the John Carter Vincent matter,
                        saying that on a review of the hearing before the Review Board, it seemed to
                        me that the Board was passing judgment, not on Mr. Vincent’s loyalty, but on
                        the question of his judgment on the controversial issues of China policy. I
                        thought that if the loyalty program got into this field, it would destroy
                        the Foreign Service, and I was, therefore, thinking of seeking a board
                        composed of an eminent judge and several people familiar with the Foreign
                        Service to consider the matter, advise me whether my fears were founded and
                        advise me further whether I should exercise the legal <pb n="34"
                            xml:id="pg_34" facs="0060"/>power in accordance with the Board’s
                        recommendation or in some other way.</p>
                    <p>I said that some members of the Board I had in mind, and mentioning them, had
                        wondered whether they could finish their work before January 20 and what Mr.
                        Dulles’s attitude toward their work would be thereafter. They did not wish
                        to start upon a task which he would want to discontinue. After some
                        discussion, in which Mr. Dulles showed an appreciation of the dangers to the
                        Foreign Service, which I had suggested, he said that I might say that he
                        would regard the work of the Board as helpful and would be glad to talk with
                        any members who might wish to talk with him. He stressed the fact that the
                        appointment of the Board and the whole procedure should be wholly my
                        responsibility, and not a joint responsibility. I said that I fully
                        appreciated this.</p>
                    <p>I then brought Mr. Dulles up to date on developments in Iran, including our
                        talks in London and Paris during the past week and with developments in
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>I mentioned to him that Senator Carl Hayden had told me that there was a
                        great deal of activity on the Hill regarding the so-called Bricker amendment
                        dealing with the treaty making power. I said that Senator Hayden had
                        suggested that I bring this to Mr. Dulles’s attention, as he might wish to
                        find out from his Republican colleagues whether amendment action was
                        contemplated, since this might be a grave embarrassment to Mr. Dulles. Mr.
                        Dulles made a note of the matter and said that he would look into it.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion he said that he would be in and out of Washington and that at
                        any time I had matters which I thought should be brought to his attention,
                        he would be glad to call upon me.</p>

                    <p>The Arab States greeted the election of General Eisenhower with enthusiasm,
                        as marking a probable turning point in U.S. policy toward the Near East.
                        They expect from the new Administration a <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35"
                            facs="0061"/>greater appreciation of the strategic importance of the
                        area and a recognition of the greater importance of the Arab countries
                        relative to Israel in the strategy of Near East defense against the USSR.
                        The question is how to deal with this Arab attitude, which presents both an
                        opportunity and a problem to basic U.S. interests in the Near East.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Background:</hi></p>
                    <p>The conviction of the Arab world that the outgoing Administration is heavily
                        biased toward Israel was reaffirmed recently by U.S. support of the
                        Eight-Power Resolution at the United Nations General Assembly, operative
                        paragraph 4 of which urged the Israelis on the one side and the Arab States
                        on the other to seek a peace settlement by entering “at an early date,
                        without prejudice to their respective rights and claims, into direct
                        negotiations for the establishment of such a settlement, bearing in mind the
                        resolutions as well as the principal objectives of the United Nations on the
                        Palestine question, including the religious interests of third parties” This
                        paragraph is regarded by the Arab States as relegating previous United
                        Nations resolutions concerning Palestine into a position where they could be
                        ignored, and as requiring negotiation to be on the basis of the <hi
                            rend="italic">de facto</hi> boundary and refugee situation in Palestine.
                        Arab bitterness on this subject during the General Assembly debate was
                        recently reflected in a violent press campaign against the West in the Arab
                        States. In addition, the Arab League is holding a threat of economic boycott
                        over the Federal Republic of Germany, effective at such time as the German
                        Parliament ratifies the Restitution Agreement which it signed in 1952 with
                        Israel, and has charged the U.S. with responsibility for this “un-neutral”
                        document, which they say, ignores the compensation rights of the Arab
                        Palestine refugees.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Discussion:</hi></p>
                    <p>The Arab attitude towards the election of General Eisenhower has been more
                        clearly indicated by press reactions in the Near East than in official
                        statements. The press was particularly vocal in Beirut and Baghdad, less so
                        in Syria and Egypt where military regimes exercise a more strict control
                        over what is printed.</p>
                    <p>The Arabs appear to hope vaguely for a new orientation of U.S. policy towards
                        the Near East which will include: (1) greater emphasis on economic and
                        military assistance to the Arab States as compared with Israel; (2) an
                        affirmation of U.S. determination to prevent aggression by Israel against
                        the Arab States; and (3) pressure on Israel to implement the obligation
                        (which she has accepted in principle) to compensate Arab refugees, to
                        repatriate to Israel a substantial proportion of the Arab refugees, and to
                        rectify her <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0062"/>boundaries with the Arab
                        States at least in rough equivalents to the allocations of territory
                        outlined in United Nations resolutions which have gone unobserved by both
                        Israel and the Arab States.</p>
                    <p>However vague and imprecise may be the feelings of the Arab States, there is
                        no doubt that their hopes are very high. This fact presents both an
                        opportunity and a risk at a time when the U.S. Government is moving to
                        effect a settlement of differences between the U.K. and Egypt and to
                        establish a Middle East Defense Organization. The alternatives are three: <list>

                                        of such a visit would recall to Near Easterners General
                                        Eisenhower’s pre-inaugural visit to Korea and would serve to
                                        emphasize an awakened U.S. understanding of the rising

                        on what has been done by the Department of State to facilitate an orderly
                        transition to the incoming Administration, I should like to report that the
                        following steps have been taken:</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">General Liaison Arrangements</hi>—Shortly after the
                        appointment of Senator Lodge as the general liaison officer for the new
                        Administration, Mr. Bruce met with Senator Lodge and informed him that the
                        Department was ready to place all necessary information at his disposal.
                        Subsequently, there have been frequent exchanges of information between
                        Senator Lodge and Departmental representatives on general liaison problems,
                        and I am confident that we have made every effort to make his liaison task
                        an easy one.</p>

                        Secretary of State in the new Administration, I wrote to Mr. Dulles assuring
                        him that all of us in the Department of State stood ready to help him in any
                        way that we could to assure the smoothest possible transition. Accordingly,
                        Mr. Dulles was provided with an office in the Department and all
                        Departmental officials were placed at his disposal for consultation and
                        assistance. I have had two meetings with the Secretary-designate at which we
                        discussed Departmental administrative questions and some of the more
                        critical foreign problems facing the country. Mr. Dulles has met Under
                        Secretary Bruce on several occasions to discuss administrative and top level
                        personnel problems and has also consulted the Director of the Executive
                        Secretariat about the organization and operation of the Office of the
                        Secretary. The two Deputy Under Secretaries, the three Assistant Secretaries
                        responsible for European, Far Eastern, and United Nations Affairs, and the
                        Director of the Bureau of German Affairs have talked with Mr. Dulles. At his
                        request, he has received the advice of these and other Departmental
                        officials on such specific questions as the loyalty of United States
                        citizens employed by the United Nations Secretariat, Stalin’s reply to the
                        Reston question, the New Year’s message from General Eisenhower to General

                        In addition, Mr. Dulles has obtained oral briefings from United States
                        Ambassadors to France, Iran, and Pakistan who were back in the Department
                        for consultation and who, therefore, were available to explain the latest
                        developments in their respective countries.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Other Appointees</hi>—In my letter to Mr. Dulles I also
                        told him that when the new top Departmental officials had been named, we
                        would be glad to have them come to the Department and sit in with
                        Departmental officials to discuss problems that would later come under their
                        jurisdiction. The personnel and facilities of the Department have been
                        placed at the disposal of the recent appointees: Messrs. Lourie, McCardle,
                        Morton, and Phleger. Each has either received or will soon receive both oral
                        and written briefing on the organization and procedures of the Department
                        and on the problems in the area for which he is to be responsible. With the
                        announcement that Senator Lodge would replace Ambassador Austin as the
                        United States Representative to the United Nations, <pb n="40"
                            xml:id="pg_40" facs="0066"/>meetings on United Nations problems were
                        arranged for the Senator with Ambassadors Austin and Gross, the Deputy Under
                        Secretary of State for Administration, and the Assistant Secretary for
                        United Nations Affairs.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Briefing Material</hi>—In order that the incoming
                        Departmental officers might be fully informed about the immediate problems,
                        as well as the longer-range problems which they would face, briefing
                        materials were prepared for their use. The Department’s Executive
                        Secretariat compiled two comprehensive briefing books for the
                        Secretary-designate and the Under Secretary-designate: one, a General
                        Briefing Book, contained information on the organization of the Department,
                        the operation of the Office of the Secretary and Under Secretary, major
                        programs, relations with other Government agencies, and legislative and
                        budgetary reviews; the other, a Policy Briefing Book, contained statements
                        of current United States policies, broken down on a geographical area,
                        functional, and organizational basis. The General Briefing Book is being
                        provided to all incoming Assistant Secretaries, and policy briefing books
                        are being prepared on an individual basis to inform new officers of the
                        current policies in their areas.<note n="3" xml:id="d12fn3">The briefing
                            books under reference have not been found.</note> At the request of
                        General Eisenhower’s representatives, briefing material on Korea was
                        prepared for General Eisenhower’s trip to Korea last month and on United

                    <p>As the Secretary of State and the President are aware, the restoration of
                        public confidence in the Department of State will depend primarily upon its
                        having the wit, the wisdom—and the luck—to be associated with policies that
                        yield readily perceptible results favorable to the national interest,
                        particularly in Korea, Western Europe, including Germany, and Iran.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, measures not directly related to substantive policies can
                        be taken that may be expected to produce a more favorable atmosphere than
                        has lately surrounded the Department. These include:</p>

                            Congress</hi></p>
                    <p>Lack of public confidence in the Department has been materially contributed
                        to by criticism originating in the Congress. As one means of forestalling
                        uninformed criticism, the Secretary might consider the desirability of
                        assuring the widest possible understanding in the Congress of the problems
                        facing the Department. He might hold regular or bi-weekly meetings with the
                        chairmen and the ranking members of the committees of the Senate and the
                        House of Representatives dealing with foreign affairs. He might instruct the
                        Assistant Secretaries and other substantive officers of the Department to
                        hold similar regular meetings with members of the committees dealing with
                        problems of mutual concern. He might further encourage officers of the
                        Department to cultivate friendly relations with the members of the Congress.
                        The end sought should be understanding of the requirements of foreign policy
                        as it develops rather than when a crisis is reached. Confidence in the
                        correctness of policy in given circumstances will breed confidence in those
                        who shape it.</p>

                            might contribute to popular confidence by appointing a body of

                            be made so, their report could serve to reassure personnel that their

                        <item>For several reasons, including the high degree of specialized training
                            normally required, the personnel of the Department has tended to be
                            somewhat less widely representative than the personnel of other
                            executive agencies. Without the sacrifice of exacting professional
                            standards, the appointment of individuals drawn from a wider circle to
                            ranking positions in the Department would tend to arouse the interest of
                            women, Negroes and others, enhance the representative character of the
                            personnel and thus develop confidence in the Department. Similar
                            considerations might continue to be taken into account in the
                            appointment of delegates and alternates to the General Assembly of the

                        <item>The Secretary of State is inescapably the living symbol of the
                            Department in the public mind. His public appearances and his public
                            statements are therefore highly important to the prestige, the
                            reputation and, hence, the effectiveness of the Department. The press is
                            the medium through which, over the long term, he will make a deep
                            impression on a great number, and the press will reflect him primarily
                            through his periodic press conferences. Although these are given over
                            primarily to an exposition of specific policy questions, the Secretary
                            might also occasionally utilize them to discuss departmental affairs.
                            The Secretary can also command space in the press by submitting signed
                            articles to newspapers and magazines; the utility of the Sunday magazine
                            sections for making an impression is not to be underestimated.</item>

                            popular impression. The Secretary may wish to consider utilizing them
                            not merely for disseminating major utterances but for giving currency to
                            excerpts from press conferences and, together with newspaper photographs
                            and newsreels, for helping to present a sympathetic image to the public

                            the support of a specific group and making a personal impact. The
                            Secretary will be called upon to make many such appearances during the
                            course of a year. By making several, notably in areas such as the Middle
                            West and the Southwest, he will contribute to the prestige of his
                            office, thus developing support for imperfectly understood policies and
                            creating confidence in the Department.</item>

                            the Secretary to restore public confidence in the Department. He can
                            further contribute to this end by timely public appearances with the
                            Secretary, thereby reaffirming his own confidence in the Department over
                            which the Secretary presides.</item>

                            effective press support for the policies that he is carrying out by a
                            series of off-the-record conferences with selected correspondents. The
                            Assistant Secretaries and other knowledgeable officers of the Department
                            should be encouraged to make themselves available to selected
                            correspondents for off-the-record discussions.</item>

                        <item>The Secretary will have relatively few opportunities for direct
                            contact with individual citizens. However, he can to some extent
                            compensate by making time for brief interviews with representatives of
                            many influential organizations of citizens whose support of foreign
                            policy is important to its success. The meetings might be attended by
                            one or another Assistant Secretary, with whom the individual or
                            organization might have subsequent business.</item>

                            Although the Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs has a broad
                            responsibility in public relations matters, his actual working
                            responsibility is in fact vague. SA/M is the point of contact for the

                            exception of the preparation of the speeches of the Secretary, most of
                            these activities proceed on a piece-meal basis in answer to some urgent
                            need and do not reflect carefully considered public relations. A
                            carefully integrated program would contribute to the improvement of the

                    <p>The actions of the Secretary will need to be reenforced by measures in which
                        he and his immediate staff are not directly involved. The Office of Public
                        Affairs is preparing a detailed outline of specific measures. Given the
                        authority to do so and the necessary budgetary support, it can introduce
                        into its publications, its conferences with non-governmental groups, its
                        radio and television activities discreet but effective material contributing
                        to the development of public understanding of and popular confidence in the
                        Department. It can, among other things, arrange for the production of a
                        documentary film demonstrating how foreign policy is made and executed. It
                        can help to develop public interest in the building in which the major
                        activities of the Department are located. It can develop exhibits that will
                        stimulate public interest in the operations and the achievements of the
                        Department. The need to avoid contra-productive propaganda is clearly
                        recognized. Equally recognized is the need to help to develop public
                        understanding of the role of the Department as a guardian of the national
                            interest.<note n="2" xml:id="d13fn2">A memorandum of a telephone

                            the Attorney General about the multiplicity of hearings and
                            investigations into the Department and said that they were calling

                            ruining the morale of the Department. He said that he thought only the
                            President could cope with this and that some thought should be given to
                            it. There are now about ten Committees investigating the Department.”

                        President Truman, assumed leadership within the Executive branch of an
                        interagency staff review of economic foreign policy. The purpose of the
                        review was in part to reexamine the validity of assumptions underlying
                        international economic policies developed during the post-World War II
                        period, and in part to enable the succeeding administration to evaluate the
                        adequacy and direction of current programs. John M. Leddy, Director of the
                        Office of Economic Defense and Trade Policy, was designated to organize the
                        preparation of studies and, together with Harlan Cleveland, Assistant

                        in the review, which was concluded in early March 1953, produced a large
                        number of staff papers, identified as EFP D–1 to EFP D–31a. A complete set

                        economic notions about the working of the international economic system. I
                        have the feeling that differences of viewpoint which have been expressed
                        with respect to the wisdom or practicality of some of the economic programs
                        we have been thinking about may be rooted in disagreements on basic
                        assumptions. I also feel that it may be these differences in fundamental
                        concepts which account for the differences in approach to the economic
                        problem represented by, say, the Rosenson paper on convertibility<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d16fn2">Not printed; a copy is in the Randall Commission
                            records.</note> and the <hi rend="italic">Economist</hi> suggestion for
                        an Atlantic Clearing Union.</p>
                    <p>The points to which I think we should address our attention are these:</p>
                    <p>1. How is it expected that a world system of trade and payments, free of
                        quantitative restrictions and exchange controls and with <pb n="47"
                            xml:id="pg_47" facs="0073"/>convertible currencies, would be kept in
                        balance? In other words, what equilibrating forces are expected to operate
                        so as to prevent persistent surpluses and deficits (not accounted for by
                        normal capital flow)? Under the gold standard the notion was that an inflow
                        of payments produced by an export surplus would tend automatically to
                        increase prices in the surplus country and reduce prices in the deficit
                        country, thus stimulating imports into the surplus country and deterring
                        imports into the deficit country. Whatever may have been the validity of
                        this notion in the past it is clear that under present and foreseeable
                        circumstances there is no direct or automatic connection between the inflow
                        and outflow of payments and internal price levels. Whatever connection may
                        exist would presumably have to be established through conscious acts of
                        internal credit and fiscal policy by the governments concerned. If this is
                        in fact the case I wonder whether it is enough to say that balance will be
                        achieved if only governments pursue “stable” internal financial policies. In
                        other words, do not internal fiscal and monetary policies need to be much
                        more closely tailored to the condition of the external balance (and to the
                        internal policies of other governments) than would be implied by a simple
                        undertaking to promote internal stability? Again, if this is true, isn’t it
                        almost a prerequisite of equilibrium through the price mechanism that
                        internal policies be brought into the international arena in a much more
                        powerful way than some of our papers seem to contemplate, and may this not
                        be an argument for some new kind of international organization?</p>
                    <p>2. It may be objected to the foregoing that in the case of a country such as
                        the United States, whose international trade is such a small portion of
                        total <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>, under no circumstances could the
                        state of the external balance be expected to have an important equilibrating
                        influence on internal price levels even if the old gold standard were in
                        operation and certainly not under present circumstances under which
                        comparable effects could be achieved only through internal policy. This is
                        probably true, but the fact that it is would seem to have little practical
                        importance so long as the United States is on a surplus basis and so long as
                        the United States, for a variety of reasons, is prepared to maintain an
                        internal policy directed at high levels of employment. However, to some
                        extent a similar problem exists elsewhere, for example France, whose
                        international trade is only about 10 percent of <gloss target="#t_GNP1"
                            >GNP</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>3. We have been assuming that it would be possible over time to bring United
                        States international accounts into balance through commercial policy
                        measures designed to increase imports, through investment flow to
                        underdeveloped areas, through special projects such as the food program to
                        remove “structural” distortions in the situation by increased output of food
                        elsewhere, and by appropriate <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0074"
                        />internal policies abroad. During the past few years, however, a number of
                        people have come to believe, without being able to prove the point, that the
                        United States has an inherent bias toward an export surplus. So far as I
                        have been able to discover, two main reasons have been put forward for this
                        belief. The first is that since the rate of increase of <hi rend="italic"
                            >over-all</hi> productivity in the United States is greater than
                        elsewhere, the United States will perpetually tend to run an export surplus.
                        If this belief is correct then it is difficult for me to see how any of the
                        things that we have been discussing (with one exception) could bring about
                        equilibrium through the price mechanism. While reductions in the United
                        States tariff and appropriate internal policies elsewhere would increase the
                        level of imports into the United States, presumably the tendency toward U.S.
                        exports would also increase. Similarly, the stimulation of food output in
                        underdeveloped areas and of capital flow to underdeveloped areas would not
                        seem to help the balance-of-payments situation under these circumstances.
                        The one exception is to be found in a change in foreign exchange rates, but
                        presumably so long as our total productivity tends to increase at a faster
                        rate than others, there would have to be a continuing depreciation of
                        foreign currencies over time. The disadvantages of continuous depreciation
                        as a solution to the problem may argue for much stronger emphasis than we
                        have been giving to measures to increase foreign productivity.</p>
                    <p>The second main explanation which has been given of the U.S. bias toward
                        export surplus lies in the structure of American imports and exports. The
                        argument here is that since the great bulk of American imports is in crude
                        materials and semi-finished manufactures, the level of total U.S. imports
                        tends to be affected primarily by the rate of industrial production and is
                        little affected by changes in price. On the contrary price declines tend to
                        reduce rather than increase the total value of imports. On the other hand
                        American exports, which are largely manufactures, are sensitive to price
                        changes, so that price declines tend to stimulate exports from the United
                        States. In other words, for the United States, price declines tend to work
                        in only one direction. They stimulate exports without stimulating imports.
                        What the policy implications of this may be I am not quite clear except to
                        confirm what we already know—that effective tariff reductions by the United
                        States very largely relate to imports of finished manufactures.<note n="*"
                            xml:id="d16fn-sym9">It should be noted that the proportion of finished
                            manufactures in total U.S. imports has increased from about 10 percent
                            of the total pre-war to about 13 percent in 1950 and to 17 or 18 percent
                            in 1951 and 1952. [Footnote in the source text.]</note></p>
                    <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0075"/>
                    <p>4. I am not sure how the foregoing ideas with respect to the persistent
                        export bias of the United States economy square with the concept of
                        comparative cost of [<hi rend="italic">as</hi>] a basis for international
                        trade. If comparative cost operates, presumably trade would take place even
                        though the United States were more productive in each item of trade than
                        other countries so long as there were disparities in productivity between
                        different industries in the United States. I hope someone will be in a
                        position to explain this at the meeting. One point I would like elucidation
                        on, incidentally, is whether the idea of comparative cost is intended to be
                        only a very long run factor, significant at points of new investment, or
                        whether it is also assumed to be a short run factor which currently
                        influences the quantities of commodities exported and imported through the
                        price mechanism.</p>
                    <p>I do not believe that the discussion on these various theoretical subjects
                        should be pushed too far but I believe that some examination of these points
                        may help to throw light on what we may expect from some of the specific
                        policies and programs we are considering.</p>

                    <p>On August 14, 1953, President Eisenhower appointed Clarence B. Randall,
                        Chairman of the Board of Inland Steel Company, as Chairman of the Commission
                        on Foreign Economic Policy. The Commission, commonly referred to as the
                        Randall Commission, was established in pursuance of Title III of the Trade
                        Agreements Extension Act of 1953 (Public Law 215), approved August 7, 1953;
                        for text, see 67 Stat. 472.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of the Commission was to conduct a thorough review of United
                        States foreign economic policy, to recommend appropriate policies and
                        practices for the future, and to report its findings to both the President
                        and Congress. The organization of the Commission was completed on September
                        22, 1953. It proceeded to take testimony from witnesses in the United States
                        and for four days in Paris; its work was completed in January 1954. The
                        Commission’s majority report was transmitted to the President and to
                        Congress on January 23, as <hi rend="italic">Report to the President and the

                        was transmitted to the President and Congress on January 30 under the

                    <p>In accordance with your request of January 27, 1954, I am transmitting a
                        memorandum which contains the Department’s comments on the recommendations
                        of the Randall Commission.</p>
                    <p>Since receipt of the Report we have given consideration to the question of
                        the Administration’s approach to the Report as a whole. It is our strong
                        view that, on balance, the wisest course for the Administration to pursue
                        would be to accept the program proposed in the Report as the new take-off
                        point for the reformulation of our foreign economic policy. Otherwise, we
                        run a substantial risk that the advantages created by the generally
                        constructive nature of the Report will be dissipated.</p>
                    <p>In recommending this course of action, we wish to note that there are many
                        individual recommendations in the Report with which the Department would
                        have disagreed if they had not formed a part of the carefully balanced
                        “package” which the Report represents. We feel, however, that these
                        differences should be submerged in the interest of achieving progress in the
                        constructive reformulation of our foreign economic policy as a whole.</p>
                    <p>The Department’s detailed comments, contained in the attached memorandum,
                        must be viewed in the light of the general position stated above. These
                        comments are made largely in order to indicate omissions and isolate
                        ambiguities. However, if the Administration <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51"
                            facs="0077"/>should decide, in the end, to reopen any of the main issues
                        covered in the Report, our comments on some points would be more extensive
                        and more critical.</p>

                            that, in practice, the recommendations with respect to economic aid will

                            themselves sustain the burden, to support military forces essential for
                            our security. Another part—moderate in amount—represents a critical
                            supplement to larger programs of development undertaken by some
                            countries with their own resources. These latter programs are believed
                            to be consistent with the Commission’s thinking that “where our security
                            is importantly involved … moderate grants in aid may serve the national
                            interest of the United States.”<note n="2" xml:id="d18fn2">Ellipses

                        <p>In many underdeveloped areas, the relationship of our security to
                            programs of development is direct and immediate. The basic maladjustment
                            of underdeveloped countries is the result of the pressure of their
                            peoples for accelerated economic development and the insufficiency of
                            their domestic resources and foreign exchange availabilities to do the
                            job which must be done. The security of the United States will be
                            greatly enhanced if these peoples are convinced that free society holds
                            more for them than does communism. The United States has, therefore,
                            regarded economic aid as a weapon in the fight against world communism
                            as well as an expression of essential United States humanitarianism.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the recommendation that economic assistance should be in
                            the form of loans rather than grants, there may be some cases where
                            substantial economic aid to a country will be warranted in the interest
                            of the United States and where any loans made would have to be in a form
                            not meeting ordinary banking standards. The problems and difficulties
                            which such loans would <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0078"/>involve,
                            however, are so serious that we consider that these need to be
                            reemphasized.</p>
                        <p>There are also a number of major problems with respect to economic grant
                            aid on which the Report does not touch. Reconstruction aid in situations
                            such as Korea represent one group of such problems. The problems
                            involved in the agricultural surplus disposal program also present
                            difficult and important issues.</p>
                        <p>Finally, when considering the foreign aid section of the Report, note
                            should be taken that the Commission did not address itself to the
                            question of extension of economic assistance in association with other
                            nations. This question is of considerable significance both because of
                            existing United Nations programs of that type and because of the
                            President’s proposal of April 16, 1953,<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">The

                            There are several additional suggestions for stimulating foreign
                            investment which the Report does not cover and which merit careful
                            examination. These include: the use of technical assistance in helping
                            countries to improve the “climate” for private investment and to provide
                            better information concerning investment conditions and opportunities;
                            improvements in the administrative and procedural aspects of the
                            guaranty program, in order to make the program more attractive both to
                            investors and to borrowing countries; greater use of bilateral tax
                            treaties, aimed at defining the particular foreign taxes that qualify as
                            a credit against United States domestic taxes and defining the treatment
                            of temporary tax concessions offered by the foreign government to new
                            investment; greater use of the authority of the Export-Import Bank to
                            guarantee loans made from private sources, on a contingent liability
                            basis; and the possibility of joint participation by the Export-Import
                            Bank with private enterprise (American or foreign) which would not

                            necessary. In implementation of the Commission’s recommendations, it
                            would be necessary to consider, for example, the standards to be applied
                            in restricting foreign imports and subsidizing exports: Should such
                            import restrictions be designed so as not to deprive imports of the
                            share of the domestic market they would have enjoyed in the absence of
                            the domestic program; should a representative base period be employed in
                            making such determinations; should we reexamine the criteria established

                            Commission concerning the measures and policies that will be most
                            conducive to reducing the excessive instability of raw material prices.
                            It assumes, however, that the Commission recognized that many of these
                            measures can be applied only gradually and will take a substantial time
                            to achieve their purpose. It assumes, also, that this fact was at least
                            one of the reasons why the Commission deliberately avoided closing the
                            door on <hi rend="italic">all</hi> international agreements to stabilize
                            prices in the following recommendation: “The Commission does not believe

                            price instability …”</p>
                        <p>In point of fact, there will probably continue to be very few commodities
                            in which the countries affected have sufficient desire for international
                            action of this kind to result in an agreement and even fewer where the
                            peculiar circumstances make an agreement both expedient and workable.
                            Nevertheless, the United States cannot afford to adopt the attitude that
                            it will not under any circumstances participate in such an agreement,

                            treating other nations “on an equal basis”. If this criterion were to
                            rule out nations which cannot accept United States bids because they
                            cannot afford to pay for the materials in dollars, the field of its
                            applicability would be narrow and the effect would be contrary to the
                            Commission’s clear intent to provide some liberalizing action in the Buy
                            American field. Moreover, consideration needs to be given to the
                            question of how to reconcile the approach implicit in the Commission’s
                            recommendation on this point with that implicit in its recommendation
                            elsewhere, that the United States continue to follow an unconditional

                        <p>The Department accordingly believes that it would be in full accord with
                            the approach and recommendations of the Commission Report for the United
                            States to proceed expeditiously to reach understandings with the other
                            principal countries concerned on: the amounts of credits which might be
                            made available from the Federal Reserve System and which the United
                            States would support for extension by the Fund, respectively, for the
                            purpose of assisting in the establishment of convertibility of sterling
                            and other major currencies; the terms and conditions which the United
                            States should impose in connection with the extension of such credits;
                            specific additional steps by other countries which would warrant
                            commitment of such support.</p>
                        <p>In view of the similarity of interests between Canada and the United
                            States in this general area, and Canada’s present relatively strong
                            financial position, this Government should explore with the Canadian
                            Government the possibility of supplemental credits from Canada for the
                            purposes here considered.</p>

                            silent, for example, on our support for the European Coal and Steel
                            Community and on the United States view with respect to the promising

                            area of foreign economic policy with which the Report does not
                            adequately deal is the problem of restrictive business practices as they
                            affect international trade; except for a brief reference in one limited
                            context—that of encouraging international investment—no recommendations
                            are made with respect to the problem. If reliance is to be placed on the
                            stimulating effects of competition in international trade, as the Report
                            appropriately envisages, more progress must be made in the
                            discouragement of cartel practices. These practices have had a
                            profoundly adverse effect on attempts of countries to raise the
                            productivity of their economies; they have constituted direct barriers
                            to the normal flow of international trade; they have added to the costs
                            of rearmament in Europe; and they have reduced our supplies of important
                            raw materials, such as industrial diamonds. A program in this field
                            needs to be developed.</p>

                        Randall Commission Report on which it is based. However, there are a few
                        visible retreats from major recommendations contained in the Report; these
                        are mentioned below and developed in more detail in the attached annexes.
                        Our best judgment is that the policies will be regarded abroad as
                        constructive but relatively cautious and lacking in boldness. The points at
                        which the statement retreats from the Report proper will be especially
                        highlighted abroad. Taken as a whole, the statement falls somewhat short of
                        establishing a strong basis for United States assumption of leadership on
                        the economic front.</p>

                            xml:id="d19fn3">Not identified.</note> of this statement, sent to Mr.
                        Randall last week, tried to retrieve some of the lost ground in the draft

                        Accordingly, our comments were heavily conditioned by what we considered to
                        be negotiable in the ordinary course with other agencies and with the White

                                States to negotiate effectively with Japan. To do this, it will be
                                necessary to go somewhat beyond the recommendations on this point in
                                the Randall Commission Report. The proposed 15 per cent authority
                                recommended in the Report and in the draft message, assuming it were
                                fully exercised, would not afford meaningful tariff reductions for
                                that country. This is particularly important because, in many cases,
                                the depth of the tariff cuts which other nations would be willing to
                                provide for Japanese products will depend on how far we can go. A
                                specific proposal to carry out this suggestion is contained in Annex

                            <item>Strengthen our policy regarding the avoidance of agricultural
                                import restrictions. The weakest point in any effort to assume
                                economic leadership is our inability to make commitments on the
                                avoidance of agricultural import restrictions. Section 22 of the
                                Agricultural Adjustment Act requires the President to impose import
                                restrictions, despite any international agreement to the contrary,
                                whenever he finds that imports are interfering with a domestic
                                price-support program. This provision has compelled us to violate
                                the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>; it will compel us, on
                                renegotiation of the instrument, substantially to weaken the
                                existing commitments contained in it. This fact is strengthening the
                                hands of agricultural protectionists throughout the world,
                                especially Western Europe. It is likely to be one added deterrent to
                                any efforts we may make toward agricultural integration in that
                                area. And in any case it is likely to damage our own agricultural
                                export markets in the long run. Annex E develops a relatively modest
                                proposal which would strengthen our hand in this general field. This
                                proposal is consistent with the general line of the Randall
                                Commission Report though it is more specific than anything contained
                                in the Report on the subject.</item>

                            <item>Strengthen our statement on minerals policy. The Randall
                                Commission had recommended that where domestic minerals production
                                must be stimulated for security purposes, it should be stimulated by
                                means other than tariff increases or other import restrictions; the
                                alternatives might be increased stockpiling, tax incentives, or
                                direct subsidies out of the defense budget. The present draft
                                conspicuously fails to endorse this principle, though it endorses
                                others which the Commission had proposed on the same subject. The
                                failure of the draft to endorse the principle is a clear
                                retrogression from existing practice; tariff increases and other

                                has been at work over the past few weeks, also has failed to endorse
                                the principle, recommending rather “the best use of all of the
                                various existing authorities of the Government”; the Cabinet
                                Committee’s recommendations are attached as Annex F. This latter
                                formulation resolves no issues; it simply leaves the Department free
                                to urge at a later date that import restrictions are not the “best”
                                of the “various existing authorities”. The point is likely to be
                                noted at once, particularly in Canada and Latin America. The draft
                                statement could be substantially strengthened by insisting upon a
                                specific endorsement of the debated principle, carried in the last
                                paragraph of page 11.</item>

                            <item>Make a more constructive statement as regards United States
                                foreign aid policy. On April 16, 1953, the President stirred the
                                world with his pledge that a portion of any savings from world
                                disarmament might be used by the United States to help
                                underdeveloped areas. This pledge, though very much in the minds of
                                some foreign countries, was disregarded in the Randall Commission
                                Report and in the draft message. The omission will be regarded as
                                significant and disillusioning in many quarters. Annex G suggests a
                                text for reaffirming the pledge.</item>

                            Event</hi></p>
                    <p>Apart from any major effort to strengthen the statement, we feel the
                        following point must be improved:</p>
                    <p>At page 5, paragraph marked “(a)”, it is recommended that the President be
                        empowered to reduce tariff rates “by not more than 5 per cent of present
                        rates in each of the three years of the new act”. This is likely to mean
                        that the 5 per cent reduction available in the first year would not be used,
                        because tariff negotiations could not be completed in time; as a result, the
                        available power would be limited to 5 per cent a year for two years. Other
                        nations, including Japan, Canada, the United Kingdom and France, already
                        have indicated their skepticism that any worthwhile tariff reductions would
                        result, even if the full 15 per cent power were available. Indeed, there is
                        a very substantial risk that if our own negotiating authority were limited
                        in effect to 10 per cent by the formula in paragraph (a), we could not even
                        persuade other nations that any tariff negotiations were worthwhile.
                        Accordingly, to assure that the full 15 per cent authority is available, the
                        words “in each of the three years of the new act” should be replaced by the
                        words “in each successive year of a three-year period”.</p>

                                    countries. I fully endorse, therefore, the conclusion of the
                                    Commission’s Report that ‘In the application of import

                                    Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1934, as
                                    amended, so as to provide that import restrictions designed to
                                    safeguard a domestic farm program shall not be established at
                                    such levels as would deprive the foreign countries affected of

                        <p>The Cabinet Mineral Policy Committee recognizes that a strong, vigorous
                            and efficient domestic mineral industry is essential to the national
                            security and to the long-term economic development of the United States.
                            The domestic mineral industry must contribute in varying degrees to the
                            mineral raw material base for any future mobilization effort.</p>
                        <p>In addition to our need for domestic mineral production, it must be
                            recognized that there are many important minerals where efficient
                            domestic production is inadequate or entirely lacking to meet industrial
                            defense needs and where, as a consequence, foreign sources and
                            stockpiling must be relied upon.</p>
                        <p>The Cabinet Mineral Policy Committee recommends that the supply-demand
                            situation for each of the metals and minerals be evaluated periodically
                            on a case-by-case basis to establish the proper level of efficient
                            domestic production required as an adequate component of the
                            mobilization base. Where it is found that the level of such production
                            in the case of any particular mineral is likely to become, or is now,
                            insufficient to serve as such an adequate component of the mobilization
                            base, then a comprehensive program involving the best use of all of the

                            Government are inadequate to accomplish the desired objective,

                        <p>The last two paragraphs of page 10 of the draft statement indicate a
                            substantial liberalization of our existing Buy American policies, that
                            is, policies which require government agencies in general to extend a 25
                            per cent price preference in favor of domestic sources of supply. Mr.
                            Weeks may argue for retaining a 10 per cent preference rather than the
                            proposed 5 per cent preference for domestic bidders. He feels that, in
                            addition to special treatment for depressed employment areas, there
                            should be special consideration for depressed industries. He may propose
                            that, following the certification by some official (e.g. Secretary of
                            Commerce) to the effect <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0089"/>that
                            certain industries are depressed, Government procurement officers would

                            certified industry.</p>

                        indicated that Mr. Randall had prepared a fine message to go to Congress on
                        this subject but that some differences of opinion still remained for
                        settlement. Mr. Randall then reviewed the coordination and stated the
                        objective of the message as an attempt by the President to keep strictly in
                        line with the report rather than take a far-advanced position which would
                        endanger support already gained from somewhat reluctant groups.</p>
                    <p>A memorandum of State Department recommendations for revision<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d20fn2">A copy of the reference memorandum, which is undated and
                            bears no drafting information, is filed with the source text. It
                            contains four recommendations, similar to those made in the memorandum
                            by Deputy Assistant Secretary Kalijarvi, <ref target="#d19"><hi
                                    rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>, concerning special treatment for
                            Japan, increased tariff reductions, elimination of 50–50 shipping
                            provisions, and the stimulation of domestic mineral production by means
                            other than tariff increases and import restrictions.</note> was
                        presented and discussed. With respect to State’s request <pb n="64"
                            xml:id="pg_64" facs="0090"/>for a sentence indicating the possible need
                        of exceptional treatment for Japan, the President commented that Congress
                        ought be given advance warning rather than have State later introduce the
                        need unexpectedly. The Vice President commented that such a reference would
                        not create problems on the Hill. Mr. Randall agreed to develop a suitable
                        reference with General Smith.</p>
                    <p>On the suggestion that the proposal for three annual 5% tariff reductions be
                        consolidated to 15% over three years so that full effect of the authorized
                        reductions would not be lost by protracted negotiations during the first
                        year, Mr. Randall stressed the prior extensive debate within the Commission
                        and the heavy opposition which would be aroused by any change from the
                        report. The President suggested that negotiations might be hastened and that
                        in any event the legislation was designed to establish a pattern for policy
                        throughout subsequent years when the State Department might make up any
                        losses. It was agreed that the message would not be changed in this
                        respect.</p>
                    <p>The third proposed change, providing for the elimination of the 50–50
                        shipping clause, was rebutted by Secretary Weeks who reviewed the pertinent
                        sections of the Commission’s report. The President suggested that individual
                        opinions might be given during testimony. Gov. Stassen recalled intense
                        Congressional interest in this subject, and predicted the impossibility of
                        change until a new subsidy plan is developed. Gen. Smith agreed.</p>
                    <p>The fourth State Department recommendation for a positive statement
                        concerning stimulation of domestic mineral production required for security
                        purposes by other means than tariff increases or through import
                        restrictions, received the President’s approval along with general Cabinet
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed also to accept Secretary Humphrey’s suggestion for eliminating
                        a sentence concerning mineral policy which appeared to be contradicted by
                        subsequent statements. Mr. Humphrey also commented on the problem of the
                        relationship between importation of minerals and domestic production. Gen.
                        Smith and Mr. Randall emphasized that the section in question pertained only
                        to stimulation of domestic production.</p>
                    <p>The Attorney General strongly recommended against the provision for reducing
                        the 5% differential connected with the Buy American Act, and he suggested
                        that in default of legislation to this effect the Buy American Act should be
                        applied on a case-by-case basis. He felt that Executive action would be
                        regarded as an invasion of Congressional prerogatives, to which Mr. Flemming
                        agreed. After Mr. Randall indicated that he had no strong feeling, the
                        President upheld the Attorney General’s view and favored substitution <pb
                            n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0091"/>of a clause calling for determination
                        on the basis of a reasonable percentage depending on the circumstances of
                        each case.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Flemming cited a possible conflict between the message and the
                        forthcoming recommendation of the Subcommittee on Minerals Policy,<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d20fn3">Apparent reference to the Cabinet Committee on
                            Minerals Policy. See also the editorial notes, <ref

                        made it clear that the report and the message did not preclude use of
                        tariffs to support domestic mineral production for reasons of the national
                        economy; rather it ruled out only use of tariffs as a means of subsidizing
                        defense industries. Mr. Randall responded to another query by Mr. Flemming
                        to the effect that the Commission had carefully considered and decided
                        against a recommendation to have the Tariff Commission in its proceedings
                        take into account broad factors of foreign policy, etc.</p>

                    <p>The basic aim of our foreign policy is to improve the security and well-being
                        of the US. This objective is generally accepted and understood. <pb n="66"
                            xml:id="pg_66" facs="0092"/>What is less widely appreciated is the fact
                        that our international economic policies are a major instrument for
                        achieving this objective. In fact, unless we can regain and step up the
                        initiative in the foreign economic field, US leadership in the free world is
                        threatened.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of this paper is threefold: (1) to indicate the role of US
                        foreign economic policy in our total foreign policy; (2) to explore the
                        general requisites of effective economic leadership; and (3) to suggest some

                    <p>There is a ready acceptance of the fact that our political and military

                        security and wellbeing. It is more difficult, however, to explain what it is
                        about the Schuman Plan<note n="3" xml:id="d22fn3">For documentation on the

                        detailed matters as a proposed increase in the US duty on lead and zinc, or
                        the imposition of quota restrictions on imports of almonds or tung oil, the
                        connection with our broad foreign policy objectives seems remote indeed.</p>
                    <p>Why should the State Department, including on many occasions its highest
                        ranking officials, become concerned with matters which are so technical or
                        seemingly so unrelated in any direct way to the effective conduct of our
                        foreign affairs?</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">General Policies</hi></p>
                    <p>The answer lies in the basic nature of our present foreign policy. That
                        policy is predicated on the idea that we strengthen US security by
                        solidifying our ties with other nations of the free world. Accordingly, we
                        have built a web of relations which, taken together, amount to an alliance
                        among virtually all free world nations—<gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                        >NATO</gloss>, ANZUS, <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>, our ties with
                        Japan, etc. But these ties are not purely military or political. An alliance
                        without economic underpinnings would be inadequate and unreliable</p>
                    <p>Success in modern warfare depends upon the basic economic strength of the
                        nations involved. A modern war cannot be fought without access to highly
                        complex and expensive material and equipment and without the means to
                        support the civilian economy at the same time. A country can maximize its
                        ability to contribute to a common military cause if it maintains a high
                        level of production <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0093"/>through the most
                        efficient use of its human and material resources. But efficiency is reduced
                        when each country tries to build on its own resources alone. To the extent
                        that a country insists on producing things which it can purchase more
                        cheaply abroad, it reduces the total quantity of goods available to it as
                        well as to its trading partners. The amazing productivity of the American
                        economy is in considerable measure a reflection of the fact that we have in
                        the US a vast common market virtually free from internal restrictions on
                        trade and the movement of capital. Our efforts in the international field to
                        promote a freer system of trade and payments and a freer flow of capital are
                        aimed fundamentally at achieving a more efficient international use of
                        resources and thereby maximizing the economic and military strength of the
                        free world.</p>
                    <p>Concerted efforts are also being made by the USSR to achieve a maximum
                        military potential by integrating the economies of the countries within the
                        Soviet bloc. A considerable measure of success has been achieved through a
                        centrally directed allocation and use of resources for this purpose. The
                        Soviet drive underlines the importance of removing those restrictions and
                        impediments which stand in the way of the most efficient use of resources in
                        the free world.</p>
                    <p>It is against this background that our support of the International Monetary
                        Fund and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade takes on added
                        significance. These are the instruments through which we try jointly with
                        other countries to establish a world trading system that will provide the
                        real basis for high standards of living and a maximum contribution to
                        military security. There may be nothing dramatic about technicians from 34
                        countries spending months of laborious work negotiating an agreement
                        involving 8, 800 tariff concessions. And it may take several years or longer
                        before the full economic effects of the action are realized. But the fact
                        that the results may be imperceptible from day to day doesn’t make them less
                        important. In setting our foreign policy goals we look beyond tomorrow, and
                        our foreign policies must therefore also be directed to building the
                        long-run strength of the free world as well as to dealing with tomorrow’s
                        crisis.</p>
                    <p>Our alliances with other countries of the free world consist of far more than
                        the provisions of formal agreements to which we may jointly be party. The
                        formal undertakings are in fact largely reflections of the sense of
                        mutuality of interest shared by the peoples of the countries involved. To
                        the extent that this feeling is shaken by economic fears or disputes, the
                        military alliance can be weakened or destroyed.</p>
                    <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0094"/>
                    <p>Many examples of such fears or disputes could be cited. Foreign governments
                        and representatives are still deeply concerned and preoccupied with the
                        damages that might be expected in their countries from a recession in the
                        US. The pressure to impose restrictions on wool imports has created
                        consternation in Australia. Congressional demands to curb imports of
                        petroleum raise doubts in the minds of Venezuelans as to whether we really
                        care about the welfare of their country which is so closely tied to oil
                        exports to the US. Relatively small actions, such as the failure of the
                        low-bid English concern to obtain the government contract for the Chief
                        Joseph Dam, have given rise to tremendous ill feeling abroad. Such actions
                        and the retaliations to which they give rise create an atmosphere inimical
                        to the building up of political and ideological loyalties among peoples. And
                        without strong loyalties political alliances remain fragile at best.</p>
                    <p>In our efforts to prevent actions harmful to the free world security system
                        we face the practical dilemma posed by the conflict between the special and
                        often short-run interest of particular domestic economic groups and the more
                        general longer-run national interest in free world strength and solidarity.
                        Much of the time and energy of the people concerned with foreign economic
                        affairs is devoted to assuring that in resolving these conflicts the
                        longer-run national interest is adequately taken into account.</p>
                    <p>In our efforts to build the strength of the free world, we have had
                        constantly to recognize risks short of outright warfare which may imperil
                        our ultimate plans. They include the transfer of political power to
                        unfriendly hands as well as the risks of internal subversion and defection
                        in strategic areas. Areas in which such risks exist are spotted around the
                        globe. In the underdeveloped areas a continuous frustration of the desire
                        for growth can bring these dangers to the surface.</p>
                    <p>Increased Soviet efforts at subversion are now directed to the people of
                        underdeveloped countries. The Communist appeal runs largely in terms of the
                        hopelessness of the present economic situation of the masses in these areas
                        and their subservience to the economic, political and strategic needs of the
                        US. Since many of these areas have never known political democracy in our
                        sense, a counterappeal in terms of the advantages of Western democracy is
                        apt to seem abstract and not too meaningful. What is needed is steady
                        economic improvement and the creation of a sense of hope for the future.</p>
                    <p>To be effective a program for the underdeveloped areas must appeal to these
                        basic aspirations. Unfortunately, the instruments available to the US are
                        not entirely adequate in relation to the job to be done. They consist of the
                        technical assistance program, a <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0095"
                        />modest amount of economic aid, mostly in Asia, the temporary availability
                        of agricultural surpluses, the lending activities of the Export-Import Bank,
                        and our participation in the International Bank. Although their importance
                        should not be minimized, these various forms of public assistance, taken
                        together, contribute only a small portion of the resources that
                        underdeveloped countries need for economic growth. An additional
                        contribution is, of course, made by US private capital but, outside of Latin
                        America and the oil countries of the Middle East, private US investment in
                        underdeveloped areas has not been substantial. Moreover, private capital can
                        be influenced by US action to only a minor extent. It has to be attracted by
                        the foreign countries themselves. And the principal deterrent—the
                        uncertainties engendered by the present tensions—are outside the control of
                        the underdeveloped countries.</p>
                    <p>A basic problem we face in underdeveloped countries is that economic
                        improvement depends in large part on policies pursued by the local
                        governments. Proper policies on their part can greatly increase the
                        effectiveness of our contribution. In fact, the direct aid programs
                        constitute to a considerable extent the means through which we attempt to
                        induce other countries to take appropriate action. It is in this sphere that
                        some of our most difficult and delicate economic activities are conducted.
                        While recognizing and respecting the diversity of values and institutions in
                        other countries, we must foster the adoption of policies conducive to local
                        investment and initiative and the establishment of a rational system of
                        priorities in development programs. We must encourage appropriate monetary,
                        fiscal, and other policies in order to help trigger off a development
                        process in economically stagnant countries and to cope with the danger of
                        run-away inflation in economies undergoing rapid development. And at the
                        same time we must avoid even the appearance of “intervention.”</p>
                    <p>We aim to improve our security not only by building the strength and
                        cohesiveness of the free world but also by retarding the build-up of Soviet
                        economic power internally and the extension of Soviet influence beyond the
                        Iron Curtain. We seek to accomplish these objectives through a cooperative
                        system of strategic trade controls and through specific efforts to prevent
                        the growth of a dangerous reliance on trade with the Soviet bloc on the part
                        of free world countries.</p>
                    <p>The ability of other countries to refrain from selling strategic goods to the
                        Soviet bloc depends in good measure upon their ability to market such goods
                        elsewhere in the free world. Similarly, the avoidance of undue general
                        reliance on Soviet sources of raw materials and on Soviet markets depends on
                        the extent to which other channels of trade remain open.</p>
                    <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0096"/>
                    <p>But the task of keeping the channels of trade open runs squarely into the
                        same conflict of interest to which we have already referred. While seeking
                        to reduce the present heavy reliance of Finnish trade on Soviet markets, the
                        US is considering the imposition of anti-dumping duties on imports of
                        Finnish hardboard. While seeking to prevent Italian dependence on Iron
                        Curtain markets for its agricultural products, the US has imposed a quota on
                        almonds and filberts and has subsidized exports that compete with such
                        traditional Italian products as oranges and lemons. Many other examples
                        could be cited. It is the task of the Department to bring into sharp focus
                        the conflict between proposals for such actions and the achievement of our
                        foreign policy objectives so that in the last analysis decisions are made in
                        terms of the totality of the US national interest.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Some Specific Area Policies</hi></p>
                    <p>The achievement of many of our specific foreign policy objectives for
                        particular areas can be advanced through programs primarily of an economic
                        nature.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">In Western Europe,</hi> for example, the US has been
                        fostering closer political and economic integration as a means of more fully
                        developing the strength of the area commensurate with the richness of its
                        human and material resources. In addition, it is realized that the most
                        practical way to permit Germany to assume her role in the common defense
                        without alienating France and Benelux is to merge Germany into a larger
                        complex of Western European nations.</p>
                    <p>The major concrete step already taken in this direction has been the
                        establishment of the Coal and Steel Community. In this organization Germany,
                        France, Italy and Benelux have each relinquished to a supra-national body
                        powers over basic industries such as have never before been yielded by
                        sovereign governments. Without affirmative US support from the beginning, it
                        is unlikely that this unprecedented step could have been taken. At the
                        present critical time when the fate of the European Defense Community hangs
                        in the balance, the US is seeking to strengthen the Community of Six by
                        providing a substantial loan to the High Authority of the <gloss
                            target="#t_CSC1">CSC</gloss> as evidence of our faith in the European
                        integration movement. The link between economic action and political
                        objective is direct and clear.</p>
                    <p>For Western Europe as a whole the US has encouraged closer economic ties
                        through the elimination of national trade and payments barriers. Under the
                            <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> trade liberalization program,
                        supported by the credit and clearing arrangements of the European Payments
                        Union, most nations of Western Europe have gone a long <pb n="71"
                            xml:id="pg_71" facs="0097"/>way toward eliminating quantitative barriers
                        against each other. But the success of further measures in the same
                        direction depends heavily on the example provided by the US. The fact that
                        the US restricts the imports of chemicals and cheese, for example, has in
                        practice armed the chemical and cheese producers of Western European
                        countries with a powerful argument for resisting their Government’s efforts
                        to reduce similar restrictions within Western Europe.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">In the Far East</hi> our security plans include the
                        development of Japan as an outpost of strength in the free world’s efforts
                        to stem Soviet aggression in that area. To achieve this objective, Japan
                        must assume the major responsibility for her own defense and become a
                        defense base for the area as a whole. These military objectives cannot be
                        achieved, however, unless the Japanese economic position markedly
                        improves.</p>
                    <p>With an arable land area less than that of California, Japan must support a
                        population of 86 million. Under these circumstances, Japan is dependent on
                        international trade. She must export in order to earn the currency she needs
                        for her vital food, raw material, and other imports. But today Japan’s trade
                        is seriously out of balance.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese trade deficit in 1953 was over a billion dollars. Much of this
                        deficit has been made up in recent years through our special expenditures in
                        Japan related to the war in Korea. With the end of the fighting in Korea,
                        the slack will have to be made up either through subsidy by the US tax-payer
                        or by developing adequate trade possibilities within the free world,
                        especially within the area of South and Southeast Asia which has many of the
                        physical resources needed by Japan. The latter solution is obviously the
                        desirable one. It is rendered especially difficult, however, because of the
                        natural attraction of trade with the China mainland and Manchuria, important
                        trading areas for Japan before the war.</p>
                    <p>Here again we have a military objective which can only be met if certain
                        basic economic adjustments take place. Through our foreign economic policy
                        we have been seeking to bring about the necessary adjustments.</p>

                        for products of the free world, including Japan. Steps are now being
                        examined to aid in the modernization of Japanese productive facilities

                    <p>Of major significance have been our efforts to influence the degree of access
                        offered to Japanese goods both in the US and in other free nations. In the
                        process we have encountered opposition <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0098"
                        />from domestic interests (e.g. the West Coast tuna industry) and a deep
                        fear of a resurgent Japan on the part of Australia and other countries in
                        the area. Nevertheless, some limited success was achieved last year under US
                        pressure when the contracting parties to the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> permitted Japan to associate with the group and allowed
                        her to acquire some of the rights of a contracting party. Major further
                        strides can be made through concrete steps on the part of the US to lower
                        its own tariffs on Japanese goods and through making concessions to third
                        countries which in turn will make it possible for them to open up their
                        markets to Japanese goods. We are now seeking the authority to take this
                        initiative.</p>

                        serves as an excellent example of this relationship between our total
                        foreign policy and our foreign economic policy. Our principal objective at
                        Caracas was to obtain the concrete expression of hemispheric solidarity that
                        was embodied in the anti-communist resolution. It was apparent, however,
                        that the willingness of some of the Latin American countries to follow our
                        lead in political matters was closely linked in their minds with the
                        expectation of some concrete evidence of US willingness to contribute more
                        fully to the solution of the major economic problems confronting the area.
                        It was in recognition of this sentiment that Secretary Dulles devoted almost

                        for the Rio Conference have provided us with the occasion for a searching
                        re-examination and reformulation of our economic policy toward Latin America
                        with a view to making it a more effective instrument for promoting our
                        general objectives in the area.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing examples illustrate the intimate link between our foreign
                        economic policy and the attainment of our broad political and military
                        objectives. It follows that the effective conduct of foreign affairs can
                        only be achieved if we adopt a bold and constructive foreign economic policy
                        designed to strengthen the economic underpinnings on which the security of
                        the free world rests.</p>

                    <p>The US occupies a position of economic leadership regardless of its wishes.
                        The question is whether it uses this position for good or for harm—that is,
                        whether it uses it to build or to undermine the strength and cohesiveness of
                        the free world. It hardly seems possible that in its present position US
                        economic policies could operate as merely a neutral force.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Sensitivity to US Economic Conditions and
                            Policy</hi></p>
                    <p>The predominance of the US in the world economy is well known. With only six
                        percent of the world’s population, we account for well over forty percent of
                        the world’s output of goods and services. We generate as much as two-thirds
                        or more of the world’s savings. Our foreign trade amounts to between fifteen
                        and twenty percent of the world total. We are the largest single supplier
                        to, and the largest single market for, a very large number of individual
                        foreign countries. Accordingly, the course of economic conditions in the US
                        and the policies we pursue in the international economic field assume
                        tremendous importance in terms of our relations with our allies.</p>
                    <p>In 1949 we had a slight recession here—a drop in our national income of 3.4
                        percent. We hardly noticed it. But during this mild adjustment Western
                        Europe’s exports to the US dropped almost 22 percent. Chile’s sales to us
                        dropped 36 percent and Australia’s 34 percent. Changes of this degree rock
                        the economies of friendly countries, directly affect the jobs and well-being
                        of their people, and often create threats to political stability.</p>
                    <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0100"/>
                    <p>It is not easy for Americans to appreciate this great sensitivity of other
                        countries to even small changes in economic activity in the US. While we
                        ourselves have suffered severe declines, they have not in our lifetime been
                        induced by economic forces stemming primarily from abroad. The US is
                        relatively invulnerable to economic shocks originating in foreign countries.
                        Our foreign trade and investments, though of major importance in certain
                        particular lines, are in the aggregate such a small portion of our
                        tremendous national income that the US is in a position to withstand
                        external shocks with only minor disturbance. This relative invulnerability
                        to changes from abroad is a reflection not only of the great size and
                        diversity of the American economy but also of the high degree of resiliency
                        with which a free enterprise and free market system reacts to those changes
                        which do occur.</p>
                    <p>In most countries other than the US, the economic well-being of the
                        population is much more heavily dependent on direct earnings from
                        international trade and is therefore affected to a much greater degree by
                        changes both in the physical volume of trade and in the prices of
                        internationally traded goods.</p>
                    <p>This dependence is dramatic in the case of many underdeveloped countries
                        whose foreign exchange earnings are highly concentrated in a few primary
                        materials. Sixty percent of Brazil’s export earnings are derived from
                        coffee; for Chile 51 percent are derived from copper; for Columbia 78
                        percent from coffee; for Cuba 82 percent from sugar; for Venezuela 97
                        percent from petroleum; for Egypt 89 percent from cotton; for Indonesia 95
                        percent from tin and rubber; for Ceylon 78 percent from tea and rubber; for
                        Iraq 80 percent from petroleum; for Pakistan 87 percent from cotton and
                        jute.</p>
                    <p>Access to foreign markets is also far more vital for other highly developed
                        countries than it is for the US. Though large in absolute terms, US exports
                        constitute only about 5 percent of the national income. For the UK exports
                        amount to 21 percent of the national income; for Canada 26 percent; for
                        Denmark 27 percent; for the Netherlands 46 percent; for New Zealand 37
                        percent; for Australia 21 percent.</p>
                    <p>In the light of the foregoing we can understand why it is that an American
                        discussion of restrictions on wool imports is front page news in Australia,
                        although it is barely known beyond wool circles in the US. A US decision to
                        subsidize the disposal of dairy products abroad is important domestically
                        primarily to our dairy interests. It becomes a matter of the greatest
                        moment, however, to the entire population of a country such as New Zealand,
                        one-quarter of whose exports consist of dairy products.</p>
                    <p>Exporting countries can contemplate subsidies by countries other than the US
                        without fear; but subsidization by the US is cause for <pb n="75"
                            xml:id="pg_75" facs="0101"/>alarm. If carried to its ultimate
                        conclusion—the disposal of our agricultural surpluses regardless of
                        international consequences—the end result could be virtually the economic
                        destruction of other countries dependent on the export of agricultural
                        products. The decision by the US to dispose of its surpluses abroad, either
                        through gifts and special aid programs or through the simple device of
                        selling at a loss, has brought a flood of inquiries and representations from
                        Canada, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Egypt, Turkey
                        and others. Promises that we would use our vast power with restraint have
                        only been partly reassuring. Our position of economic leadership requires
                        that we be certain that decisions taken for reasons that may be responsive
                        to domestic pressures do not sacrifice the solidarity of the free world.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Psychological and Propaganda
                        Factors</hi></p>
                    <p>It is not only the actual or potential consequences of US economic policies
                        which cause them to assume such magnified importance abroad in terms of our
                        political and security objectives. Certain psychological realities must also
                        be taken into account. Because the US is so big and so strong, it is
                        expected by other nations that we will act more in terms of the common
                        interest of the free world than in terms of a narrow conception of US
                        self-interest. When countries other than the US take action which in the
                        short-run furthers their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, it
                        may be quickly forgotten. The same action on our part is regarded as a
                        breach of the standards of responsibility which nations associate with our
                        position of leadership.</p>
                    <p>Because friendly countries are conscious of the tremendous power of the US
                        for economic good and economic harm, they are especially sensitive to the
                        importance of prior consultation before we take decisions that can affect
                        their welfare. One of the most impassioned speeches at Caracas was that in
                        which Chile protested the allegedly inadequate US consultation with respect
                        to the strategic embargo on copper exports to the Soviet bloc. Copper
                        exports are vital to Chile’s economic welfare and there is no question but
                        that the embargo hurts. But it was the lack of adequate consultation that
                        rankled most. The Chilean speech struck a responsive chord in many other
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Much of the harm that might have been done to our international relations by
                        our surplus disposal operations has been prevented by our promises to
                        consult affected countries before we act. But the need to act quickly may
                        tempt us to make our own appraisal of the effect on friendly countries and
                        to act without consulting them. If we yield to this temptation, our previous
                        promises to consult will be the cause for new grievances. Even very slight
                        damage to the <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0102"/>economy of a friendly
                        country may create a breach in relations that will be difficult to
                        repair.</p>
                    <p>US policies which damage the interests of our allies, or which create doubts
                        as to where their interests lie, are not only in themselves destructive of
                        free world unity. They constitute propaganda weapons in the hands of the
                        Communists in their program of dividing and conquering the world.</p>
                    <p>Stalin, before his death, sketched in rough outline the way the Communists
                        hoped that the disunity of the free world could be achieved. He saw the
                        crisis in terms of inevitable trade conflicts between the nations of the
                        free world. Stalin may be dead, and the music coming from Moscow may be soft
                        and sweet. But the recent moves of the Kremlin clearly indicate that it
                        intends to exploit to the full weaknesses and divisions in the economic
                        structure of the free world.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">The leaders of the Soviet Union are apparently proceeding on
                        the theory that economics is the Achilles heel of the West.</p>
                    <p>A few illustrations drawn from the trade policy field will show how the
                        Soviet world has sought to exploit recent US actions. When steps were
                        initiated in the US to restrict imports of Australian wool, the Soviet Union
                        for the first time in two years entered upon a program of buying wool in the
                        Australian market. When the Department of Defense turned down the low
                        British bids for the sale of generators and transformers for the Chief
                        Joseph Dam, the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Poland, and Rumania offered at the
                            <gloss target="#t_ECE1">ECE</gloss> meeting in Geneva to buy electrical
                        equipment, including transformers and generators, from the UK. When, in the
                        spring of 1953, imports into the US of dried whole milk were embargoed and a
                        comprehensive list of dairy products were placed under quota,
                        representatives of two Soviet bloc countries immediately offered to buy
                        Swedish dried whole milk. When the US imposed a quota on <pb n="77"
                            xml:id="pg_77" facs="0103"/>almonds and filberts, while at the same time
                        subsidizing exports of oranges and lemons, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria
                        offered to buy almonds, lemons and oranges in the free world. When the US,
                        as a result of an escape clause action, raised the duty on Turkish figs,
                        Czechoslovakia offered to buy figs from Turkey. When a countervailing duty
                        was imposed on Uruguayan wool tops and when pressure was exerted to curb
                        other imports from Latin America, the Soviet Union pressed for the
                        completion of a trade treaty with Argentina.</p>
                    <p>This partial list of the many opportunities seized upon by Communist
                        propaganda makes clear the Soviet intentions to use economics to divide the
                        free world and to conquer it by peaceful means if possible. Victories on the
                        battlefields would be hollow indeed if we lose the struggle in which we are
                        now engaged on the economic front. Survival of the free world may depend
                        upon the way in which we use our position of economic leadership.</p>

                    <p>It is easier to point out the pitfalls to be avoided than it is to lay out an
                        affirmative and constructive foreign economic policy commensurate with our
                        leadership in the free world. There are, however, five essential ingredients
                        in such a policy.</p>

                        <item>The US must maintain a high level of economic activity at home. This
                            is a responsibility which derives not only from considerations of
                            domestic welfare but equally because of the effects of a decline in US
                            economic activity on the well-being of friendly countries. A serious
                            depression in the US is still pathologically feared by most countries of
                            the free world. If it should ever materialize, the achievement of our
                            foreign policy objectives would literally be imperiled.</item>

                        <item>To a greater extent than heretofore, the US should discuss in advance
                            and in a spirit of genuine consultation with friendly foreign
                            governments, any contemplated US actions significantly affecting their
                            economic well-being. Part of the sting can be taken out of actions
                            adversely affecting friendly countries when advance consultation is held
                            and the necessity for the action explained.</item>
                        <label>(3)</label>
                        <item>The US should consider courses of action in terms of the common
                            interest of the free world rather than in terms of a narrow conception
                            of US self-interest. Official recognition has been given to this
                            principle in connection with tariff matters. The escape clause and peril
                            point provisions of our tariff legislation are designed to mitigate
                            injury to our domestic producers from tariff reductions. In commenting
                            on these, I shall carefully consider the findings and recommendations of
                            the Tariff Commission. My responsibilities for the welfare of the nation
                            require that I continue to base my decisions at times on broader grounds
                            than the Tariff Commission is empowered to consider.”</item>
                        <label>(4)</label>
                        <item>The US should adopt a fairly long-run view of what is in the common
                            interest, implying a willingness to take constructive economic <pb

                            imminent crises. The massive relief and economic aid programs of recent
                            years to Europe bear testimony to the ability of the US to respond
                            quickly and effectively to situations of crisis. Now that these programs
                            are tapering off, our position of leadership will be tested by our
                            initiative and steadfastness in pursuing the same goal of strengthening
                            the free world through measures which will generally be less dramatic
                            and more conventional. Our policies looking toward freer trade,
                            multilateral convertibility and economic development should be
                            strengthened even though those policies are designed for the long
                            pull.</item>

                        <item>The US should assert an affirmative interest in the economic
                            well-being of the free world as something which is good in itself and
                            not merely as a defense against Communism. This is both good policy and
                            good propaganda. As propaganda, the Communists have used it effectively
                            in constantly giving voice to a concern for the poor, the “downtrodden”
                            and “exploited”. In terms of policy, we cannot afford to be purely on
                            the defensive. Even if there were no Communist threat, it would be in
                            our interest to promote economic development in underdeveloped areas and
                            raise the general level of production and trade in the world. The worst
                            mistake we can make in this connection would be to link our constructive
                            economic programs so directly and obviously to our military objectives
                            as to raise doubts in the minds of free world countries as to whether we
                            are really interested in economic welfare as something which is good in
                            itself (e.g. recent proposals that aid to India be cut off because of
                            India’s refusal to permit the flight of troop planes over Indian
                            territory).</item>

                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">A Basic Dilemma</hi></p>
                    <p>In trying to translate these general principles into a bold and affirmative
                        program of action, the US faces a basic dilemma.</p>
                    <p>Our conception of the proper role of government in economic affairs is much
                        more narrow than that of most other countries. In peacetime we tend to think
                        primarily in terms of private action rather than in terms of governmental
                        capabilities. For us the major normal function of government in the economic
                        sphere is to provide an environment in which private enterprise can flourish
                        free from artificial restraints. This basic creed we carry over into our
                        economic relations with other countries. Our principal specific objectives
                        relate to the removal of artificial restraints on the movement of goods,
                        services and capital, whether publicly or privately imposed. We seek to
                        reduce tariffs, eliminate quotas, get rid of cartels, do away with exchange
                        restrictions, get rid of restraints on foreign investment, etc. The burden
                        of the program is that the government should interfere as little as possible
                        with the free market, but should act as the promoter and guardian of
                        conditions under which the market can operate most effectively.</p>
                    <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0105"/>
                    <p>This conception of the role of government is not shared by many other
                        countries of the free world. To these countries, therefore, there appears to
                        be a contradiction between our vast responsibilities as leader of the free
                        world and what seems like the absence of a bold, positive and constructive
                        program except in time of emergency. It is this difference in basic premises
                        as to the function of government that gives rise to a great deal of
                        misunderstanding and disappointment abroad in regard to our economic
                        policies.</p>
                    <p>Two examples will serve to illustrate the problem. Raw material producing
                        countries expect us, as the largest consumers of raw materials, to take
                        affirmative action to stabilize the markets for their products. In reply we
                        have pointed out how attempts to interfere with the free market in domestic
                        agriculture have gotten us into major difficulties, how the most
                        constructive contribution toward greater stability which we can make would
                        be to avoid procurement practices which disturb world prices and to temper
                        the fluctuations in our own economy. Similarly, some underdeveloped
                        countries expect the US itself to assume a major financial obligation for
                        economic development. Our position has been, however, that private capital
                        must provide the main source of foreign investment. Except for special
                        situations, the direct US contribution should be limited to technical
                        assistance and a limited amount of public lending. In many foreign
                        countries, particularly in the underdeveloped areas, these policies give
                        rise to a feeling that the US has not measured up to its
                        responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>A major task for US foreign economic policy is to get across to other
                        countries an understanding of our conception of the role of government in
                        economic affairs.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The President’s Program</hi></p>
                    <p>Against a background of such understanding the program which the President
                        presented on March 30 in his message on the Randall Report will be regarded
                        as a forward-looking and constructive approach to our foreign economic
                        policy. The President’s message contains recommendations on the subjects of
                        tariffs and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, customs
                        administration and procedures, US investment abroad, Buy American
                        legislation, raw materials, shipping, international travel, economic aid and
                        technical assistance, East-West trade and convertibility. A copy of the
                        President’s message and a detailed summary of the proposals contained
                        therein are attached.<note n="8" xml:id="d22fn8">Attachments are not

                    <p>The Department should take advantage of every opportunity to support the

                            facs="0106"/>placed on his statement; “If we fail in our trade policy,

                        security, and the solidarity of the free world—are all involved.”</p>
                    <p>Pending action on the President’s message, the Department should seek a
                        moratorium on actions by other agencies inconsistent with the spirit of the
                        message. Examples include Treasury’s use of anti-dumping legislation to
                        restrict imports from Finland and other sensitive areas; the sudden raising
                        of import duties by reclassifying items which have previously entered under
                        lower rates; periodic threats of countervailing duties; Agriculture’s use of

                        leadership in the economic sphere. The following are illustrative of

                            <item>Consideration should be given to the possibility of adapting our
                                stockpile policies as a specific means of contributing toward
                                greater stability in the markets for basic commodities exported by
                                underdeveloped countries. Policies have already been adopted by the
                                Office of Defense Mobilization to make certain that excess
                                commodities acquired under materials expansion program contracts do
                                not produce serious adverse market effects. These policies are
                                essentially preventive rather than affirmative stabilization
                                measures. In the new long-range “safe level” stockpile policy,
                                recently announced by the White House, the basis is laid for more
                                affirmative steps to stabilize the markets for strategic minerals
                                through the concentration of purchases in periods of distressed
                                market conditions. While the announcement emphasizes that preference
                                will be given to minerals of domestic origin, purchases abroad are
                                not precluded. Regardless of the origin of the materials purchased,
                                however, a positive contribution to international commodity
                                stabilization can be made by counter-cyclical purchases of materials
                                that are traded on world markets. Can the new policy laid down by

                                    <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0107"/>to make commitments on
                                the avoidance of such restrictions. Section 22 of the Agricultural
                                Adjustment Act requires the President to impose import restrictions,
                                despite any international agreement to the contrary, whenever he
                                finds that imports are interfering with a domestic price-support
                                program. This provision has compelled us to violate the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>; it may compel us, on
                                renegotiation of the instrument, substantially to weaken the
                                existing commitments contained in it. This fact is strengthening the
                                hands of agricultural protectionists throughout the world,
                                especially Western Europe. It is likely to be one added deterrent to
                                any efforts we may make toward agricultural integration in that
                                area. And in any case it is likely to damage our own agricultural
                                export markets in the long-run.</item>

                            <item>On April 16, 1953, the President stirred the world with his pledge
                                that a portion of any savings from world disarmament might be used
                                by the US to help underdeveloped areas. This speech was not referred
                                to in the Randall Report nor in the President’s message on the
                                Report. The omission has been widely noted. The US should carefully
                                consider whether the appeal of the President’s earlier pronouncement
                                should be allowed to lapse. If not, what actions would we be
                                prepared to take to regain and retain the initiative?</item>

                            <item>The President’s message on foreign economic policy recognized the
                                importance of encouraging an increased flow of private capital
                                abroad and proposed tax changes and enlarged guaranty coverage to
                                stimulate such a flow. These measures may be partially effective but
                                the political hazards of foreign investment will continue to be a
                                strong deterrent. If private capital could move abroad under the
                                umbrella of a combined public-private agency, the political hazards
                                would be significantly reduced. In this connection, it is well to
                                note one of the recommendations of the Report of Lewis Douglas to
                                the President: “In the immediate future, however, it may be
                                practicable to focus our ingenuity on valid devices which might
                                provide a reasonable transition from a period in which American
                                dollars, through public agencies, have been invested overseas and
                                the period when the flow of private capital becomes adequate. To
                                this end, a combination of agencies of governments working in
                                association with private management and capital might perform a
                                useful service”. Consideration of “valid devices” of this character
                                might well be undertaken.</item>

                            <item>A related problem not dealt with in the President’s message
                                concerns measures to stimulate local private investment abroad,
                                particularly in the less developed countries. While this is
                                essentially a problem for the governments and peoples concerned,
                                further study should be given to measures we can take to encourage
                                such <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0108"/>investment, as for
                                example, by supporting the establishment of domestic development

                            <item>Continued active study should be given to the peacetime uses of
                                atomic energy, particularly as they affect economic development. We
                                might also give some consideration to the feasibility of
                                establishing one or more regional nuclear research centers, as for
                                example a Latin American center, to which we would make available
                                nuclear reactors for experimental purposes. An offer of this kind
                                might be useful in itself, to the extent that there were technically
                                trained persons in the regions who could carry forward research, but
                                beyond that such an offer would have a powerful appeal. Atomic
                                energy has a “mystique” of its own. It would gratify the intense
                                desire of less developed countries to be associated in atomic
                                research.</item>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sirs</hi>: Over the past several months it has
                        become increasingly apparent that we are going to be faced with a continuing
                        series of complex problems in the foreign economic field which not only will
                        involve over-all foreign policy, but will often directly affect basic
                        domestic policy questions.</p>
                    <p>In discussions with you and others as to the manner in which the Executive
                        Branch has handled these problems over the last year, my attention has been
                        called to difficulties which may be attributed at least in part to
                        inadequacies in the organizational structure for handling the development
                        and implementation of foreign economic policy.</p>
                    <p>I am impressed with the fact that at present, the Executive Branch lacks an
                        orderly way of identifying and reconciling conflicting points of view and
                        interests in the development of long-range international economic objectives
                        in support of our foreign policy as well as in the development of policies
                        and programs to achieve those objectives. This is also true in arriving at
                        solutions to individual foreign economic problems in a way that reflects our
                        best overall national interest. Some of these problems have been handled by
                        the State Department, some by one or more of my immediate assistants, some
                        by Cabinet Committees, some by the National Advisory <pb n="83"
                            xml:id="pg_83" facs="0109"/>Council, and in a few cases by the National
                        Security Council or the Cabinet. Despite the best efforts, the handling of
                        such problems on an <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> basis has not always
                        produced the timely or decisive action required by the seriousness or
                        urgency of the problem encountered.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, I desire as a matter of high priority, that my Advisory
                        Committee on Government Organization and the Director of the Bureau of the
                        Budget collaborate in a study of the suitability of existing organizational
                        machinery for the formulation and implementation of foreign economic policy
                        within the framework of our overall foreign policy, and develop specific
                        recommendations for my consideration.</p>
                    <p>I agree with your suggestion that, in order to assure that this study has
                        full-time top-level direction, the Committee and the Bureau of the Budget
                        should secure to direct the staff work of this project a top-notch
                        individual thoroughly familiar with this problem and well versed in
                        high-level government organizational relationships.<note n="1"

                        Economic Policy” prepared following a talk between C. D. Jackson and the
                        Secretary. The report<note n="1" xml:id="d24fn1">No copy of the report was
                            found in Department of State files.</note> was prepared at Jackson’s
                        request by the Cenis Center at M.I.T. under the direction of Max Millikan
                        and Walter Rostow.</p>
                    <p>After some general comment on the proposal it was stated that the study<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d24fn2">Not identified.</note> being worked up by Charles
                        F. Baldwin is similar, except that it is limited to South and Southeast
                        Asia.</p>
                    <p>The meeting was told that the Secretary favored an economic plan with some
                        such purposes (the scope was not stated), and that (a) our own interest
                        could not let the peasant peoples stew along and (b) there should be no tie
                        in the economic plan to military pacts.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Holland spoke concerning the position he believed we should take at the
                        Rio meeting. We should urge accelerated economic development in Latin
                        America, and should make a substantial contribution in capital and technical
                        knowledge. Financing should be available through the <gloss
                            target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1"
                            >EXIM</gloss> for all sound economic development projects within their
                        borrowing capacity (where private capital is not available). We should urge
                        foreign governments to set goals.</p>
                    <p>For Latin America he favored loans not grants.</p>
                    <p>He said that estimates, duly hedged, were that not over a billion dollars
                        would be required for Latin America for the next five years.</p>
                    <p>He suggested that a group study the amount of public and private investment
                        required for Latin America.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Baldwin said free Asia presented two categories of problems: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Those of Japan, which are similar to the problems of Post-War
                                Europe.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>There are a different set of problems in the primitive economies
                                of the rest of the area.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>He believes that if conditions in the primitive places can be dealt with,
                        Japan will benefit.</p>
                    <p>If we could support a program providing $10 billion of external capital to
                        the primitive economies over the next 10 years, the resulting increased

                        undesirable as the mechanism; it is not an organization, and is closely
                        identified with the British Commonwealth, however, on reflection it may be
                        best to use it in expanded form. He suggested a Board of Governors,
                        technical committees, and operation through loans, but loans repayable in
                        local currency, rather than grants. He emphasized that the U.S. should not
                        in any way dominate the scene, and it would be essential to success that no
                        political strings such as military commitments be tied to participation.</p>
                    <p>He said that it had been estimated that $600 million a year of outside
                        capital supplied to Southern and Southeast Asia would just about keep the
                        living standards of the people from deteriorating. $1, 000 million a year is
                        required for standards to advance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Merchant said he thought we were giving mistaken priorities. Congress
                        would not go very high in its aid appropriations and other areas demanded
                        prior consideration as we must not abandon our present friends. He then

                    <p>This, it was agreed, raised fundamental issues. Mr. Bowie asked whether we
                        should always favor the countries loudest in espousing our aims, and spend
                        large sums in building armed forces that could not contain a Chinese attack,
                        while leaving vast areas with huge populations to fall to the Communists as
                        their desire for better living is not met? Is the risk of military
                        aggression so serious that the inner sociological-political danger should be
                        ignored?</p>

                    <p>The view was expressed that we should continue to support armed forces in
                        Korea, Formosa and Japan, but that it was equally important to improve
                        living conditions of the more primitive peoples. It was also pointed out
                        that building up the economies of the primitive states would improve the
                        position of the Japanese economy.</p>
                    <p>There was discussion of the unwillingness of Congress to appropriate money
                        for foreign aid, of less unwillingness to appropriate money for loans than
                        for grants, even loans repayable in the currency of the borrowers, and of
                        the necessity to make clear the urgency and the risks in the situation in
                        Southern Asia. Mr. Jernegan pointed out that the total foreign aid at
                        present plus the amount mentioned as required to carry out this proposal was
                        not as great as amounts voted a few years ago, and that if the issues were
                        understood it did not seem impossible that means would be provided.</p>
                    <p>Mr. MacArthur commented on the difference between conditions in Europe in
                        1950 and in South Asia in 1954.</p>
                    <p>In 1950 Europe had a fear psychosis that Russian Armies would roll to the
                        channel.</p>
                    <p>In 1954 Southern Asia is in real danger because of the deterioration in
                        living conditions.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Randall indicated that the purpose of the meeting was to take a long look
                        ahead and review the elements in the President’s foreign economic policy
                        program for the coming year.</p>
                    <p>He indicated that the “party line” remains the Randall Commission Report and
                        the President’s message of March 30 on foreign economic policy. He said that
                        those points of the message which were not accomplished were ones which he
                        felt should be pursued. He requested any ideas that people may have. He said
                        that the feeling he gets of opinion around the country is that the
                        President’s foreign economic program is right, that there were good reasons
                        why the Administration could not move ahead farther last year, and that it
                        should move ahead on the unfinished elements in the program this coming
                        year.</p>

                            Robert W. Kean (N.J.) on Apr. 15, 1954.</note></p>
                    <p>Mr. Randall indicated that it was his view that the Kean Bill should be
                        reintroduced. Mr. Randall reported that Congressman Kean gives every
                        indication that he is prepared to serve again as an enthusiastic spokesman
                        for the bill.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Randall noted that there were some suggestions that perhaps the bill
                        should be strengthened and requested any views on this point. The general
                        consensus of the group, as reflected in specific comments by Messrs. Marget,
                        Overby and Anderson, was that it would be better to leave what has already
                        been agreed upon alone and keep the bill as it is.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Arnow raised the question as to whether the Administration should not try
                        to determine before the next session of Congress as to how the authority in
                        the Kean Bill should be administered by the Government and be prepared to
                        envisage any changes which might be made in the existing administrative
                        arrangements for conducting the trade agreements program and other elements
                        in the Administration’s foreign economic policy program. It was felt that
                        Mr. Arnow had raised an important point which should be examined. It was
                        agreed that the Trade Agreements Committee should study the matter and
                        report back to the Randall Committee.</p>

                    <p>Mr. McNeill reported on what had been accomplished in this field and the
                        present status of various customs matters. <hi rend="italic">As regards the
                            matter of simplification of tariff classifications,</hi> Congress had
                        passed the bill requiring the Tariff Commission to study the matter and
                        report to the Congress and the President the tariff simplifications which
                        might be made.<note n="3" xml:id="d25fn3">Reference is to the Customs

                            text, see 68 Stat. 1136.</note> The question remained of getting
                        authority from the Congress to put simplified tariff classifications into
                        effect, and this in turn raised the question of getting approval from the
                        Congress of standards on the basis of which it might delegate such authority
                        to the President. Mr. McNeill indicated that the next session of Congress,
                        after the Tariff Commission had made its preliminary report, might be the
                        time to seek such standards.</p>

                        question of getting further action in this field. To this end Treasury is
                        now making a further study of the factual situation in order to provide
                        effective answers to questions which had been raised on the Jenkins Bill.
                        Mr. Randall indicated that it was important to keep working on the chemical
                        industry in order to lessen its opposition.</p>
                    <p>Mr. McNeill noted that under the legislation passed this year Treasury was
                        instructed to maintain a <hi rend="italic">continuing review of customs

                        plans to have further recommendations on this matter before the next session
                        of Congress.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Randall stressed that it would be extraordinarily helpful to our
                        relations abroad if Treasury could from time to time make some announcements
                        of things it was doing to simplify our customs <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89"

                        interest on the part of foreign countries in this matter and that any steps
                        we took to make our customs administration less complicated would have great
                        effect abroad. He urged Treasury to see what it could do in this regard.</p>

                        indicated he was discouraged about the possibility of getting Congressional

                        get such action. Mr. Randall said that he thinks the bill is a good idea and
                        that he will keep it in the program. Treasury indicated that it was working
                        with Commerce to develop statistical information on travel.</p>

                        basis for obtaining income tax exemption. Mr. Waugh indicated that he had
                        some concerns about such an approach. Mr. Overby said that Treasury had
                        looked into the matter previously and did not take a favorable view on this
                        approach. Mr. Randall stated that his Commission had studied this
                        possibility but decided against it. He suggested that Treasury study the
                        matter and that it be discussed with Mr. Whitney,<note n="6" xml:id="d25fn6"
                            >John Hay Whitney.</note> who was responsible for the investment field
                        on the Randall Commission.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing discussion led Mr. Anderson to ask whether the door was open,
                        so far as possible inclusion in the President’s program was concerned, to
                        new thinking in the field. Mr. Randall replied affirmatively. He emphasized
                        that what he had tried to indicate earlier was that the “tone, direction and
                        substance” of the President’s March 30 message was to be taken as the
                        mandate on the basis of which the Administration was to operate, but this
                        did not preclude possible changes on particular aspects.</p>

                    <p>It was agreed that it would not be desirable to seek any legislation in the
                        next session for the repeal of Buy American legislation.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the recent decision of the Cabinet on the policy to be
                        applied with regard to the Buy American Act but not to issue any formal

                        policy without any such formal order. He expressed doubt as to the
                        feasibility of operating without a formal order and pointed out that to his
                        knowledge no directive had gone out to U.S. fleet services abroad and that,
                        accordingly, their procurement operations could not have been affected by
                        the recent Cabinet decision.</p>

                            embodied in Section 3. of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951.
                            That section of the act provided for a finding by the United States
                            Tariff Commission to indicate the limit or point to which a tariff rate
                            might be reduced without causing or threatening to cause serious injury
                            to the domestic industry producing like or competitive articles. For

                    <p>Mr. Randall indicated that suggestions had been made that the peril point and
                        escape clause provisions in the Trade Agreements Act should be repealed. He
                        asked for views on this point. Mr. Waugh doubted that it would be possible
                        to get either provision repealed. This appeared to be the consensus of the
                        group.</p>
                    <p>Question was raised as to whether it might be possible to eliminate the peril
                        point while retaining the escape clause. The general view appeared that it
                        would not be possible.</p>
                    <p>It was pointed out that while it might not be possible to eliminate the
                        escape clause, it was worth considering whether something might not be done
                        so as to prevent frivolous applications and immediate resubmittal of
                        applications on which escape clause action had just been turned down. It was
                        suggested that perhaps the Act should be loosened up so as to give the
                        Tariff Commission the discretion it once had to throw out applications for
                        action when there was an <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> case against such
                        action. Mr. Randall thought this was a good idea and suggested that it be
                        discussed with Mr. Brossard.<note n="8" xml:id="d25fn8">Edgar B. Brossard,

                    <p>There was discussion as to whether an effort should be made to eliminate the
                        50–50 shipping provisions. It was suggested that perhaps the 50–50
                        requirements might be waived in cases where the President might negotiate a
                        reciprocal agreement with other countries prohibiting such preferences. Mr.
                        Hutchinson expressed doubt about the acceptability of this approach and
                        suggested that it would be wise to examine the question of direct subsidy as
                        a substitute for 50–50 requirements.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Waugh expressed doubt as to the wisdom of attempting to seek action for
                        repeal of the 50–50 shipping requirements next year. He pointed out that the
                        Administration will have enough on <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0117"
                        />its hands to get through the major elements of its program in the trade
                        field and that it should, therefore, concentrate on these elements and not
                        take on additional burdens in the shipping field.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Weiss noted that there may be a possibility that the elimination of the
                        50–50 requirements only for countries with which reciprocal agreements had
                        been concluded might be inconsistent with non-discrimination commitments the
                        United States might have under <gloss target="#t_FCN1">FCN</gloss> treaties.
                        He suggested that if this approach were to be pursued, study should be given
                        to this aspect.</p>

                        suggest an answer. Nevertheless, it seems questionable whether the U.S. can

                        align the members of the Council. Here the division is between the
                        “developed” and the “underdeveloped” countries and the words strangely
                        enough have common usage. The line is rigid between the have and the
                        have-not, the progressive and the backward, the rich and the poor. Of the
                        present eighteen members of the Council only six fall into the developed
                        category (U.S., U.K., France, Belgium, Australia and Norway) while ten
                        consider themselves underdeveloped (India, Pakistan, Argentina, Ecuador,
                        Venezuela, Cuba, China, Turkey, Yugoslavia, Egypt). The remaining two, the
                        USSR and Czechoslovakia, the Machiavellian self-styled protectors of the
                        underprivileged, almost invariably side with the underdeveloped countries.
                        The underdeveloped bloc is thus in a position to rely on a majority in a
                        straight underdeveloped vs. developed vote, even with occasional desertions
                        to the developed side. It is therefore impossible to consider an affirmative
                        U.S. policy in <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> without constantly
                        bearing this division of the Council in mind. With the precedents for
                        maintaining the present geographical and political balance in the Council,
                        the situation may be expected to continue unchanged.</p>
                    <p>It now seems to be dogma in <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> that

                        depends upon the economic development of the underdeveloped countries. Every
                        resolution adopted by the Economic Committee at the 18th Session paid
                        allegiance to this thesis,<note n="‡‡" xml:id="d26fn-sym63">Document E/2643.

                        United States, can provide adequate material assistance the underdeveloped
                        countries must resort to communism and totalitarian means in an effort to

                    <p>On the surface the underdeveloped vs. developed struggle predominates.
                        Underneath there is a strong current of the cold war which sometimes emerges
                        with considerable turbulence. But at the 18th Session the Soviets “new
                        course” was in full operation. They failed to obtain consideration at the
                        17th Session of an agenda item <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0126"
                        />entitled “Removal of obstacles to international trade and means of
                        developing international economic relations”. It was considered at the 18th
                        Session as item 2(c), a sub-item under “World Economic Situation”.</p>
                    <p>As expected, the USSR used the item as a basis for attacking non-communist
                        control of strategic materials destined to the Soviet bloc and the
                        repression of East-West trade. But they attempted more than propaganda. They
                        proposed a resolution,<note n="‡" xml:id="d26fn-sym55">Document E/L.614.
                            [Footnote in the source text.]</note> the most important part of which
                        instructed the Secretary-General of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss>
                        to convene an international conference of government experts of States both
                        members and non-members of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> for the
                        purpose of formulating recommendations for developing international trade.
                        In introducing this resolution the USSR delegate said that non-communist
                        trade controls (“discriminatory measures”), had had no effect on the USSR
                        because of her vast resources, but, on the contrary, had acted against the
                        interests of the countries applying them. This theme was echoed by the
                        Czechoslovak delegate, who added that economic realities were persuading the
                        capitalist countries to put an end to the cold war so far as trade was
                        concerned, an obvious reference to the recent revision of the <gloss
                            target="#t_CGCOCOM1">CG/CO.COM</gloss>. lists.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet position throughout was mild. In the Economic Committee they
                        sought to find common ground with a U.K. resolution which in the main merely
                        requested the Secretary-General to include in his next World Economic Report
                        an analysis of factors which limit expansion of international trade. While
                        the committee rejected the USSR resolution and adopted the U.K. resolution
                        the Soviets were able in plenary, on the plea of the need for unanimity in
                        the Council, to have the U.K. resolution interpreted to mean that when the
                        Council considers the subject further at its 20th Session the question of
                        convening an international conference of governmental experts is not
                        excluded.</p>
                    <p>The USSR was successful in further extending <gloss target="#t_ECE1"

                        action on East-West trade, the USSR by this resolution seems to have set the
                        stage for a consideration of trade with China through the medium of <gloss

                        situation but concrete proposals to call a world-wide conference to do
                        something about such trade, and probably the matter of trade with Communist
                        China as well.</p>
                    <p>Prior to the 18th Session the Department suggested that in view of agenda

                        well arrive at a common position on the East-West trade aspects of the item
                        in Paris. So far as we know the matter was not considered by that group. As
                        the subject will presumably arise in the General Assembly this fall when
                            <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>’s report is considered, in all
                        of the regional commissions, and in <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                            >ECOSOC</gloss> next summer, it would still not seem amiss to try and
                        reach at least a broad general understanding on a common position through

                    <p>For the most part, while ostensibly discussing economic matters the Council
                        was also in fact engaged in a political debate wherein diligent effort was

                        that require, if they are to survive, concerted action. Foreign trade is, of

                        that trade with the Soviet bloc was equivalent to peace and prosperity. They
                        have recently extended this concept to include its contributing to the
                        economic development of the underdeveloped countries. Recent trade
                        agreements with Argentina and India are a step in this direction. On the
                        concrete side the Soviet line has been to portray an alluring picture <pb

                    <p>The true significance of the “new course” economic policy in so far as it
                        affects international trade is yet to be seen. It depends on whether the
                        Soviet bloc seriously intends to appreciably increase its imports of
                        consumer goods and can actually deliver in quantity its new exports such as
                        manganese, chrome, oil and machinery. But at the moment the USSR seems to
                        have the cold war initiative on international trade. We need concerted
                        action stemming from <gloss target="#t_CGCOCOM1">CG/CO.COM</gloss>, if we

                    <p>While the Soviet fist was well incased in velvet throughout the session, the
                        tepidness of the cold war in <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>
                        became striking after the Indo-China settlement on July 20th. The Soviets
                        immediately adopted the thesis that agreement with the USSR had been
                        demonstrated and, while not openly said, that this had been accomplished
                        without the United States. From July 20th forward it was almost considered
                        impolite for an animadversion to involve the USSR. The Council’s temper has
                        aptly been described by its president (Cooke—Argentina): “I believe that the
                        desire for peace, which seems to be the concern of the hour, has been
                        largely responsible for the calmness of the Council’s discussions. It seems
                        that we should have some justification for the belief that there is nothing
                        to prevent the peaceful co-existence of nations with different political
                            ideologies.”<note n="¶" xml:id="d26fn-sym32"><hi rend="italic">Op.

                    <p>Soviet diplomacy was skillful in playing upon the recent tendency of the
                        U.K., and France, in particular, to pursue policies independent of the
                        United States. An outstanding example of this was the success of the USSR in
                        having the French and Belgian delegations (both of whom spoke for the new
                        Soviet concept that Council actions should be unanimous) co-sponsor with
                        Czechoslovakia the resolution on interregional trade which originated in
                            <gloss target="#t_ECE1">ECE</gloss>. If successfully pursued, the
                        unanimity concept in <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> can be
                        expected to have one of two results—(a) isolate the United States by
                        confronting us with resolutions we cannot support because of principle, or
                        (b) force the United States to support resolutions regardless of principle
                        because we cannot eternally be negative.</p>
                    <p>Another noteworthy facet of the unanimity concept was the affirmative vote of
                        the USSR on <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>, which they have
                        heretofore opposed. This obvious bid for the support of the underdeveloped
                        countries bears close watching. The USSR finally felt obliged to contribute
                        to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Expanded Program of Technical
                        Assistance presumably because the program benefited the United States. It is

                        whole idea. The wind seems blowing in the direction of Soviet plans to
                        actively participate in the industrialization of the underdeveloped
                        countries.</p>

                        done, in practice, by its technical agencies and departments and “it is

                                    desired to preserve its prestige among the underdeveloped

                    <p>On November 22, 1954, Joseph Dodge submitted his report on “The Development
                        and Coordination of Foreign Economic Policy” to President Eisenhower. The
                        report, which had the concurrence of the President’s Advisory Committee on
                        Government Organization and Director of the Bureau of the Budget Rowland R.
                        Hughes, proposed as an interim solution to the problem of coordinating
                        foreign economic policy that the President establish by Executive order a
                        new, high-level foreign economic policy board or committee, representing the
                        executive departments and chaired by a White House official, to identify and
                        to consider major foreign economic policy issues. As a long-range solution,
                        the report recommended the establishment of a statutory advisory body to the
                        President to develop foreign economic policy programs. A copy of the
                        so-called “Dodge report“ is contained in PPS files, lot 65 D 101.</p>
                    <p>On December 11, 1954, President Eisenhower appointed Dodge Special Assistant
                        to the President, and authorized him to establish and to serve as Chairman
                        of a Council on Foreign Economic Policy (<gloss target="#t_CFEP2"
                            >CFEP</gloss>) through which foreign economic policy planning could be
                        coordinated. Initially, the Council was to be comprised of the Secretaries
                        of State, Treasury, Commerce, Agriculture, and the Director of the Foreign
                        Operations Administration. In addition, the President’s Administrative
                        Assistant for Economic Affairs, Special Assistant for National Security
                        Affairs, and a member of the Council of Economic Advisers were to serve as
                        ex officio members. For additional <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0131"

                    <p>The conclusions on foreign economic policy expressed here have been formed
                        after weeks of discussion with representatives from every department and
                        with many others who have been consulted.</p>
                    <p>These conclusions are based squarely upon the Special Message of March 30,
                        1954 which was in turn based upon the conclusions of the Commission on
                        Foreign Economic Policy, but they were not arrived at by any
                        pattern-mindedness. The subject was reopened in every aspect in an endeavor
                        to find weaknesses in that program or important additions to it, but the end
                        of the process has come to substantially the same result.</p>
                    <p>That there is serious distortion in the world economy is clear, and that the
                        United States should do something about it is equally clear. We are impelled
                        to that viewpoint by the short-term consideration of security, which
                        requires economic strength among our allies, by humanitarian impulses of
                        improving the lot of the underprivileged in the world, but most especially
                        by the long-term consideration that an increasing volume of world production
                        and trade is the best possible assurance for a rising standard of living for
                        our own people.</p>
                    <p>This program seeks to mitigate the distortions in the world economy by the
                        release of normal forces within the framework of free enterprise and
                        competitive markets, and is the antithesis of global spending. We have ahead
                        of us the best opportunity that has occurred in a generation to move the
                        United States intelligently toward a more liberal trade position.</p>
                    <p>The whole approach to the subject should be non-partisan, and it is extremely
                        important that foreign economic policy be the first subject taken up in the
                        new Congress. It would seem imperative that a strong note on this subject be
                        sounded in the State of the Union Message, and that in the matter of just a
                        few days thereafter <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0132"/>a special
                        message be sent to the Congress outlining the specific legislative
                        proposals. The program recommended is now outlined step by step:</p>

                        <item>The Executive Branch should continue to insist that our diplomatic

                    <p>The Administration should continue to support the principle of technical
                        assistance to underdeveloped countries, meaning by this, “know-how” and not
                        capital. An immediate effort should be made in the new Congress to restore
                        the funds required to support the multilateral technical assistance programs
                        of the United Nations. The bilateral programs of the United States should be
                        pressed vigorously.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Travel</hi></p>
                    <p>The Frelinghuysen Bill to increase the customs exemption for the incoming
                        tourist from $500 to $1,000 should be reintroduced in the Congress. The
                        amount of money involved here is not large, but the psychological effect
                        would be important in Europe.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Subsidies</hi></p>
                    <p>The President should again restate the principle that, in his judgment, all
                        costs required for our security should be directly borne to the greatest
                        possible extent and express his disapproval for this purpose of disguised
                        subsidies to American business.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Agriculture</hi></p>
                    <p>The President should once more make it clear that the necessities of our
                        agricultural program and of our foreign economic policy must be harmonized.
                        We cannot suspend natural economic laws in the field of agriculture without
                        having that cause distortion in our foreign trade.</p>

                        >GATT</gloss></hi></p>
                    <p>A medium for multilateral negotiation with other countries in the field of
                        trade is absolutely indispensable to an intelligent foreign economic policy.
                        Without that, an extension of the Trade Agreements Act for three years with
                        an intention to reduce tariffs gradually would be meaningless. The
                        Administration should therefore give its full support in the presentation of
                        the renegotiated <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> to the Congress.<note

                        international trade and payments has been corrected. No gold reserves in
                        other countries will stand against the drain if their international payments
                        as a whole are not in balance. That is why the foreign economic program
                        proposed herein would make an important contribution to convertibility.</p>

                    <p>The economic plight of Japan is desperate. Unless she can find a way to live,

                        through multilateral agreement among the free nations, by which each will do
                        its part in opening sufficient markets to Japan to help her to earn her way.
                        The President should fully support that concept.</p>

                        Executive Order regarding the Buy American Act with a statement that the
                        formula developed at Cabinet last July had been cleared at staff level in
                        the departments and agencies. He stressed the psychological need for
                        adopting it in the very near future. The Director of the Budget called
                        attention to Section 3 (a) which had been inserted for legal reasons by the
                        Attorney General as an “escape clause”. He hoped it would be understood that
                        Cabinet members would not ride off on separate tangents under the authority
                        of this clause, but would instead discuss thoroughly with other interested
                        officials any major exceptions to policy which they proposed to make under
                        it. When asked by the President if the clause would vitiate the effect of
                        the Order, Mr. <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0136"/>Randall replied in
                        the negative. Mr. Rankin explained that the clause was deemed necessary
                        because of the existence of the basic Buy American Act and the
                        constitutional delegation to Congress of control over foreign commerce. Sec.
                        Dulles cited the opposite delegation of authority to the President over his
                        Cabinet. Mr. Randall believed the draft effected a good balance between
                        these delegations of authority.</p>
                    <p>The President suggested inserting the words “of urgent national interest”
                        after “reasons” in the escape clause. Mr. Randall and Mr. Rankin agreed that
                        such would be possible, although Mr. Randall expressed a doubt that it might
                        limit the freedom of department heads to reject a bid because of other
                        reasons such as the irresponsibility of the bidder. Mr. Rankin saw no danger
                        in this because such cases were covered elsewhere in the Order.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hughes reiterated the need for understanding that thorough discussion
                        would be arranged for any major exception proposed under Section 3 (a), a
                        matter which should appear in the Record of Action. The President stated his
                        complete agreement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Randall briefed his paper on the legislative program concerning foreign
                        economic policy as constituting those parts of the program recommended to
                        Congress last March but not yet achieved. He added his hope that emphasis
                        would be placed on this program in the State of the Union Message<note n="4"

                        indicated that Committee hearings would be top level in quality and he
                        pointed to the extensive growth in sentiment during the past year in favor
                        of these proposals. In running over allied items, he stressed the program
                        for incentives for the flow of investment in foreign lands, the reciprocal
                        5-year exemption proposal, the International Finance Corporation proposal,
                        continued technical assistance both direct and through the United Nations,

                        Conference, revision of customs procedures, and finally the Japanese
                        economic program.</p>
                    <p>The President asked as to the desirability of attempting in the State of the
                        Union Message to paint a picture of the wonderful world which could be had
                        by a free flow of capital. Mr. Randall and Sec. Dulles agreed that it would
                        be desirable.</p>

                    <p>The Vice President questioned and was reassured that this program would be on

                    <p>The President opened the meeting with a brief outline of the topics scheduled

                        other items if they wished. He was hopeful of developing a meeting of the

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Foreign Trade Program</hi>—Mr. Randall stressed the need
                        for the several items in this package (more than just tariff) in order to
                        extend trade and thus help our allies to develop “an earned strength” for
                        their economies and also to improve the long range welfare of the US economy
                        by expanding world markets. He felt it was necessary either to find the way
                        for the world to buy US products from earnings or to suffer a reduction of
                        US exports.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Randall stated that the proposal was essentially the same as that of
                        March, 1954, except for the addition of the International Finance
                        Corporation as a result of the Rio Conference. It would help the flow of
                        capital to private entrepreneurs rather than to governments.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Randall concluded his remarks by stressing the importance of Japan in the
                        US security picture and the need for solving its critical trade
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rayburn asked if it were not vital to get rid of trade barriers and Mr.
                        Randall responded affirmatively. Sen. Johnson thought that there was much
                        support for this program in the Congress and that it was high time to get
                        started on it. He asked if the Administration intended to drive forward with
                        the program this year. The President responded that there had been many
                        questions last year as to the program, so that a one-year extension had been
                        obtained while further study was accomplished. The President believed that
                        the current proposal was the best program that could possibly be devised by
                        the Administration and that it was very vital for us to do the things
                        necessary to enable our allies to develop their own economies in a way that
                        could support the military programs we urged upon them. Sen. Johnson asked
                        if the President intended to urge the Congress to act on this. The President
                        replied affirmatively.</p>
                    <p>Sen. Wiley felt that there was general agreement with the philosophy of the
                        Randall program but he wanted to point out that only 3% of US business is in
                        exports. He noted a number of other reasons for giving priority attention to
                        the continuing strength of <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0139"/>the
                        American economy. Rep. Halleck expressed his own support for the program and
                        the need for full explanation of its content so as to encourage popular and
                        Congressional support. Mr. Rayburn believed the program might be placed
                        first on the House agenda.</p>
                    <p>Rep. Taber thought the fundamental matter was to educate people to produce
                        things they could themselves use rather than having to rely on foreign
                        trade. Mr. Randall set forth some statistics on the importance of our
                        agricultural and heavy machinery exports, which must be paid for somehow by
                        the countries that purchase them. Mr. Halleck ascertained that the peril
                        point and escape clauses remained in the bill. Sen. Knowland inquired
                        whether Mr. Randall would be able to give the Congress full information
                        about the restrictive actions of other countries.</p>

                                President of the United States relative to the conclusion of trade

                            Japan</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Japan has formally notified the Contracting Parties that it wishes to accede
                        to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and in this connection to
                        enter into tariff negotiations with the United States and 27 other
                        contracting parties. Although August 19 was the final date for making a
                        reply, the Secretariat has been informed that our reply would be forthcoming
                        shortly. Under a special procedure, Japan’s application is automatically
                        accepted unless three contracting parties request that it be referred to the
                        next session of the Contracting Parties. It is likely that at least three
                        contracting parties will request referral of Japan’s application to the
                        Seventh Session which will meet on October 2, 1952.</p>
                    <p>The Interdepartmental Committee on Trade Agreements requests the President’s
                        approval of the following:</p>
                    <p>The United States should reply that it has no objection to Japan’s accession
                        to the General Agreement, that it is prepared to enter into tariff
                        negotiations with Japan subject to domestic legislative and constitutional
                        requirements, and that it has no objection to full discussion of the
                        question at the Seventh Session of the Contracting Parties. At the Seventh
                        Session the United States delegation should support favorable action by the
                        Contracting Parties on <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0142"/>Japan’s
                        application. However, the United States delegation should not press the
                        application to the point of incurring the risk of outright rejection or of
                        straining our relations with other countries so as to prejudice the
                        attainment of our broad policy objectives.</p>
                    <p>For several years it has been a basic principle of the United States to
                        further the development of a strong and stable economy in Japan and to
                        strengthen Japan’s economic ties with the free world. Repeated, although
                        unsuccessful, efforts have been made to obtain commitments from other major
                        trading countries to accord most-favored-nation treatment to Japan, and in
                        1949 an effort was made to have Japan invited to participate in tariff
                        negotiations conducted within the framework of the General Agreement.</p>
                    <p>There is bi-partisan recognition in this country that Japan must increase its
                        trade with the United States and the rest of the free world. Japan’s
                        over-all foreign trade is at present only about half of what it was before
                        the war while its population has continued to increase. Trade with China,
                        which accounted for over 15% of Japan’s foreign trade before the war, has
                        recently dropped to less than 1%. Japan has been forced to secure more of
                        its essential imports from the United States, both because of the reduction
                        in imports from China and because other Far Eastern areas have not regained
                        their pre-war importance as exporters of raw materials. This has made it
                        difficult for Japan to balance its dollar trade. Japan is presently able to
                        finance a $500,000,000 trade deficit only because of a temporary windfall
                        resulting from the hostilities in Korea and from the stationing of United
                        States troops in Japan. The Committee believes that the conclusion of trade
                        agreements, bringing Japan back into the trading community of the free
                        world, is one of the prime essentials in helping Japan in its necessary
                        efforts to achieve a self-supporting economy.</p>
                    <p>The prospects of lucrative trade with the Soviet bloc, including Communist
                        China, have a strong appeal to the Japanese trading community. The Japanese
                        Government has recognized that its trade with the Soviet bloc must for the
                        time being be strictly controlled in the interest of our mutual strength and
                        security. However, if the Japanese are blocked in their efforts to expand
                        their trade with the free world, they may think it necessary to re-orient
                        their trade toward Communist China and the Soviet bloc.</p>
                    <p>The Committee believes there is no real alternative to supporting the
                        Japanese application and agreeing to enter into tariff negotiations with
                        Japan. Such action would in fact be consistent with and give effect to
                        policy recently approved by the National Security Council. Any other course
                        would certainly be misunderstood. The Japanese could reasonably feel that
                        the United States was repudiating its former support and that actually we
                        were unwilling to <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0143"/>enter into trade
                        negotiations with Japan. Furthermore, anything less than affirmative support
                        would be taken by other countries as an abnegation of our commercial policy
                        of reducing trade barriers and as a weakening in our efforts to obtain the
                        economic objectives we desire. Elements already opposed to Japan’s accession
                        would be strengthened and our future efforts on Japan’s behalf would operate
                        under a severe handicap.</p>
                    <p>The United Kingdom, joined by Australia, is likely to continue its
                        long-standing opposition to Japan’s accession to the General Agreement. The
                        primary British concern relates to the depressed Lancashire cotton-textile
                        industry. The Committee recognizes that, because of the important
                        implications of the problem of integrating Japan into the free-world
                        community, it may be necessary to have high-level discussion of the question
                        with the British at some stage.</p>
                    <p>In making its recommendation the Committee has recognized that it will raise
                        serious domestic problems. Our efforts to obtain favorable action on Japan’s
                        application will undoubtedly be known publicly. Since most of the principal
                        commodities which the United States imports from Japan are sensitive
                        products, such as tuna fish, canned crabmeat, chinaware, cotton textiles and
                        toys, there will undoubtedly be many cries of fear at the prospect of
                        increased competition from Japan. Attempts may be made to justify these
                        fears on grounds of unfair Japanese competition due to low labor standards.
                        Such reactions to the prospect of tariff negotiations with Japan will be of
                        special significance in view of the fact that the Trade Agreements Act will
                        be up for renewal in the spring of 1953.</p>
                    <p>For the reasons outlined above the Interdepartmental Committee on Trade
                        Agreements believes that, despite the difficulties which will arise, the
                        United States should support Japan’s application and recommends that the
                        United States indicate its willingness to enter into tariff negotiations
                        with Japan in connection with Japan’s accession to the General Agreement. If
                        the President agrees with this recommendation, the Committee will at the
                        appropriate time request the President to approve a formal public notice of
                        intention to negotiate a trade agreement with Japan and a list of articles
                        on which possible concessions by the United States will be considered in the
                            negotiations.<note n="3" xml:id="d32fn3">President Truman approved the

                    <p>Believing it essential to take the step for domestic political reasons, the
                        Japanese Government in July made formal application for an invitation to
                        negotiate for accession to the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. The
                        question of Japan’s application has been placed on the agenda of the Seventh
                        Session of the Contracting Parties to the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> which convenes at Geneva on October 2.</p>
                    <p>The interdepartmental Trade Agreements Committee has recommended that the
                        United States delegation to the Seventh Session should support favorable
                        action on the Japanese application, but that it should not press the
                        application to the point of incurring the risk of outright rejection or of
                        straining our relations with other countries so as to prejudice the
                        attainment of our broad policy objectives. This restraining clause was added
                        largely because of the known opposition of the British Commonwealth
                        countries and the inadvisability of our pressing the United Kingdom on an
                        issue which poses some difficulty for us in view of the forthcoming
                        Presidential election and Congressional consideration.</p>
                    <p>Somewhat, to our surprise, it now appears that enough favorable votes may be
                        available at Geneva to obtain an invitation for Japan. This would be a
                        pyrrhic victory, however, unless the British Commonwealth countries were
                        included among those agreeing to invite Japan.</p>
                    <p>On September 22, representatives of the British Embassy presented an <hi
                            rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> to Mr. Thorp stating that the Japanese
                        application presented the “most acute difficulties” for Her Majesty’s
                        Government and suggesting that, instead of deciding the issue at the Seventh
                        Session, the Contracting Parties should adopt a resolution which would defer
                        the decision.<note n="2" xml:id="d33fn2">Copies of both the British <hi

                            (394.31/9–2552)</note> Mr. Thorp told the British representatives that
                        in his opinion it should be possible to draft a resolution, acceptable to
                        both the United States and the United Kingdom, under which an Intersessional
                        Committee would make a detailed examination of the matters involved in
                        bringing Japan into the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and report on
                        them to the Contracting Parties. Representatives <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119"

                        endeavoring to work out a mutually acceptable draft.</p>
                    <p>The broad language of the <gloss target="#t_TAC1">TAC</gloss> recommendation
                        leaves considerable leeway to the United States delegation to the Seventh
                        Session. Moreover, our commitment to the Japanese is limited to an assurance
                        that our delegation will be instructed to favor postponement of
                        consideration of the Japanese application or some other feasible alternative
                        and to oppose outright rejection.</p>
                    <p>The general view in the Department is, however, that we should endeavor to
                        achieve a result which would make it possible for tariff negotiations
                        between Japan and the Contracting Parties, including the United States, to
                        be undertaken as soon as feasible in view of our legislative and procedural
                        considerations; namely, by late 1953.</p>
                    <p>I am attaching a copy of a memorandum of Mr. Thorp’s conversation with the
                        British and a copy of the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire.</hi> You will note
                        that the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> makes clear the nature of the
                        British difficulties—the Government’s commitments to the British public that

                        Ministers, which can be expected to include commercial policy in its
                        discussions.</p>
                    <p>I anticipate that there will be interesting developments in this matter
                        within the next few weeks. I intend to keep our Embassy at Tokyo currently
                        informed for their own interest and in order that the latest information

                    <p>The Seventh Session of the Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on
                        Tariffs and Trade convened in Geneva, Switzerland, on October 2, 1952, and

                        29, 1952, Harold G. Kissick, Acting Assistant Chief of the Division of
                        International Conferences, indicated that the principal items of importance
                        on the agenda of the session were: (1) discussion among the Contracting
                        Parties of discriminatory import restrictions applied for
                        balance-of-payments reasons, (2) Japan’s application for membership in the
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, and (3) the question of granting
                        a waiver to six European governments enabling them to participate in the
                        Schuman Plan consistent with their obligations under the <gloss

                    <p>The Seventh Session of the Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on
                        Tariffs and Trade which concluded in Geneva on November 10 was marked by the
                        successful handling of a number of complaints of violation of the agreement
                        or impairment of rights under the agreement. (See page 1, September 29, 1952
                        issue.) Of particular interest to the US in this area were the provisional
                        settlement of the US complaint against restrictions imposed by Belgium on
                        dollar imports and the authorization to the Netherlands to reduce its
                        imports of wheat flour from the US in retaliation for restrictions on
                        imports of Dutch dairy products imposed by the US under Section 104 of the
                        Defense Production Act.<note n="3" xml:id="d35fn3">Reference is to the

                        the question of re-examination of the General Agreement was raised. The
                        chairman pointed out that if such a study is needed, the Contracting Parties

                        a formal complaint that these restrictions were damaging US trade and
                        constituted a departure from <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                        obligations. At the seventh session, Belgium announced its intention to
                        return to a regime free of quantitative restrictions and within the next two
                        or three months, as the first step, would liberalize significantly its
                        dollar import restrictions. The US and Canadian delegations expressed their
                        satisfaction with the Belgian proposal and agreed there was no need for
                        further consideration pending announcement of details of the Belgian
                        proposals. The discussion of this problem spread to the broader problem of
                        the conflict between <gloss target="#t_EPU1">EPU</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> objectives, with the French stating that
                        the solution proposed by Belgium might have repercussions on other countries

                        position on <gloss target="#t_EPU1">EPU</gloss>. He stressed the present
                        importance of <gloss target="#t_EPU1">EPU</gloss>, and the contribution it

                        convertibility, but pointed out that it is regarded in its present form as a
                        transitional arrangement. He also pointed out that the US recognized the
                        risk that, unless carefully managed, such an organization might lead to new
                        preferential arrangements. In summarizing the situation, the chairman stated
                        that the problem of reconciling the objectives of <gloss target="#t_GATT1"

                    <p><hi rend="italic">US Dairy Products Restrictions</hi>. At this session, a
                        number of countries exporting dairy products again claimed to be adversely
                        affected by restrictions on imports of dairy products applied by the US
                        under Section 104 of the Defense Production Act and asked that the
                        Contracting Parties recognize their right to take compensatory action. It
                        was the consensus that the US was still infringing the General Agreement and
                        that although the exporting countries could rightfully claim impairment, it
                        would be preferable for the US to lift the restrictions and thus avoid
                        compensatory measures. A resolution was adopted urging the US to continue
                        efforts to repeal Section 104. Of the countries claiming injury, only the
                        Netherlands was prepared at this session to specify items it might wish to
                        withdraw as compensation for its reduced exports of dairy products to the
                        US. The Contracting Parties authorized the Netherlands to reduce its imports
                        of wheat flour from the US by 12,000 tons in 1953 as compensation. In case
                        other countries feel it is necessary to take compensatory action it might be
                        necessary to convene a special session to deal with the specific proposals.
                        At the last moment the New Zealand delegate received authorization to
                        request approval of the withdrawal of certain specific items. It notified
                        its government that the instructions had arrived too late for implementation
                        at the regular session.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Other Complaints Against US</hi>. Turkey and Greece
                        indicated that they were seriously injured by “escape clause” action taken
                        by the US last summer which resulted in an increase in the duty on dried
                        figs above the levels incorporated in the US schedule in <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. The US delegation continued
                        consultations which had been begun in Washington with these countries. In
                        the case of Turkey, agreement was reached on a series of provisional
                        withdrawals permitting Turkey to increase duties on certain US products
                        entering Turkey. The Greek delegation felt there was no advantage to be
                        obtained in withdrawals it might make and asked the US to consider
                        additional concessions to offset the loss of the dried fig concession. A
                        study of trade between the two countries will be made before the next <gloss

                        additional items on which the US might grant concessions. Our delegation
                        stated it was the intention of the US, as expressed by the President when he

                    <p>Greece, supported by Turkey, also declared itself injured by the US export
                        subsidy on raisins. The US delegation expressed willingness to consult but
                        pointed out that the subsidy had been designed to maintain the traditional
                        US export market for the product and had not increased US trade or expanded
                        US production. Consultations were begun but, because of the limited data
                        available and the complicated nature of the problem, it was not possible to
                        conclude them.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Other Complaints.</hi> The Contracting Parties considered
                        the UK complaint concerning the increase in tariff rates imposed by the
                        Greek Government on a number of commodities through the upward revision of
                        previously agreed upon factors used in calculating import duties. It was
                        agreed this is a violation of the General Agreement and the Greeks undertook
                        to eliminate the violation by July 1. Another complaint was made against the
                        “contribution tax” imposed by Greece on imported goods. The Contracting
                        Parties were unable to determine whether this levy should be considered an
                        exchange measure, a customs duty, or an internal tax and decided to seek
                        advice from the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> on the exchange aspect
                        of the problem before making a decision.</p>
                    <p>With respect to Norway’s complaint concerning the discriminatory treatment by
                        Germany of Norwegian-type sardines, Germany was requested to consider ways
                        of removing the inequality of treatment accorded this product, to consult
                        with Norway and to report back at the eighth session. The Contracting
                        Parties again considered Norwegian and Danish claims that they are being
                        discriminated against by Belgium’s application of a tax on their products
                        imported for use by the central, provincial or municipal governments. The
                        tax is not applied to products of other Contracting Parties which have been
                        determined to have a system of welfare taxes equivalent to the Belgian
                        “allocation familiale”, a tax to provide allowances to workers families. The
                        Contracting Parties urged the Belgian Government to remove the
                        discrimination.</p>
                    <p>Another complaint which was disposed of at this meeting was the UK purchase
                        tax, long objected to because of its discriminatory effect on certain
                        imported goods as compared to domestic goods. <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124"
                            facs="0150"/>The UK delegation announced that the discriminatory aspects
                        of the tax had been eliminated. No progress was made in eliminating
                        discrimination in certain Brazilian internal taxes, but the Brazilian
                        delegate expressed the hope that the discrimination would be removed before
                        the next <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> session. India’s complaint
                        against Pakistan’s export tax on jute was discussed bilaterally.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Coal-Steel Community Waiver.</hi> The Contracting Parties
                        agreed to waive provisions of the General Agreement to the extent necessary
                        to permit France, Italy, the German Federal Republic, the Netherlands,
                        Belgium and Luxembourg to fulfill their treaty obligations as members of the
                        European Coal and Steel Community. In general, so far as coal and steel
                        products are concerned, the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> rights and

                        acting singly or as the community, are hereafter to be the same as though
                        they were a single Contracting Party whose customs territory included
                        European territories of the member states. Provisions were made for working
                        relationships between the Contracting Parties and the High Authority of the

                        be granted to the six countries, our delegation believes that the specific
                        waivers that were agreed upon will have the same result.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Balance-of-Payments Consultations.</hi> The Contracting
                        Parties conducted consultations with seven countries—Italy, the Netherlands,
                        France, Pakistan, Australia, Ceylon and the UK—on import restrictions which
                        they apply for the purpose of safeguarding their balance of payments and
                        monetary reserves. They discussed in considerable detail the financial basis
                        for and the method of administration of the consulting countries’ import
                        restrictions. The discussions covered a variety of specific commodities
                        which illustrated the problems facing countries imposing restrictions, as
                        well as the difficulties created for exporting countries. As in the case of
                        previous consultations, these were characterized by full and frank
                        discussion and free exchange of opinions. There was also full consultation
                        with representatives of the International Monetary Fund as provided for in
                        the General Agreement. Representatives of all of the consulting governments
                        indicated that the views expressed by the Contracting Parties in the
                        consultations would be conveyed to their governments for consideration.
                        Arrangements were made for the Contracting Parties to carry out similar

                        toward accession to the General Agreement. In view of the forthcoming

                        International Chamber of Commerce passed a series of resolutions urging
                        governments to enter into an agreement to reduce red tape in import and
                        export formalities. <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> action on these
                        resolutions was begun at the sixth session. Continuing their work at this
                        session, the Contracting Parties have now approved the text of an
                        international convention providing for duty-free entry of samples and of
                        certain advertising matter. The convention will be opened for signature
                        February 1, 1953 and will enter into force when 15 states have acceded. The
                        Contracting Parties have also agreed to review steps taken by governments to
                        give effect to principles of valuation contained in the General Agreement
                        and to ascertain methods of determining the nationality of goods. A code of
                        standards was adopted on documentary requirements for importation of goods,
                        and abolition of consular invoices and consular visas by the end of 1956 was
                        recommended. Pending such abolition, certain standard practices in this
                        field have been recommended to governments.</p>

                        consideration. The Council of Europe also submitted to the Contracting

                        lowering tariff barriers in Europe. This proposal was dealt with separately
                        from the French plan and a group of experts’ report, which was not
                        considered by the Contracting Parties, will be submitted to the Council of

                            from Paris reported that a French Foreign Ministry spokesman had
                            informed the Embassy that the prospect of Japanese competition in French
                            overseas territories appeared too dangerous to the French export trade
                            to permit the French Government to extend trade concessions to Japan
                            under <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. (394.31/12—1852)</note> He
                        said prime concern of French was with threat of increasing Japanese
                        competition in overseas territories and particularly in Associated States.
                        With latter French still negotiating on tariff policies and other bilateral
                        trade matters. Brunet acknowledged while some uncertainty prevailed, it was
                        likely ultimately Associated States would be accorded full autonomy in
                        tariff policies and seek entry into <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>.
                        In that event he thought it inevitable Associated States would themselves
                        desire tariff negotiations with Japan because of natural and historical
                        complementary commodity trade. In interim however French exporters desire as
                        long as possible retain their privileged positions in Associated States
                        market—a circumstance probably accounting for slow pace at which
                        negotiations proceeding. Brunet also made reference to recent statements by
                        Japan foreign trade authorities indicating their intention to intensify
                        export drives including sales in North Africa which prewar were of
                        significance.</p>
                    <p>As to direct Japanese-French trade, Brunet said French exports had never been
                        of any importance having been under two and half billion francs in 1951.
                        Japanese exports to France, primarily of raw materials, traditionally ran
                        eight to nine times this volume. Hence French do not anticipate any tariff
                        concessions by Japan would offer benefits to French exporters commensurate
                        with reciprocal benefits to Japanese traders. Brunet referred to inertia
                        French exporters <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0156"/>and their
                        propensity to confine sales promotion efforts to neighboring western
                        European countries.</p>
                    <p>Brunet said Foreign Office decision likely to be to abstain in vote on
                        Japanese accession to <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. It is not
                        presently contemplating suggesting any conditions for Japanese membership in
                        intersessional committee meeting inasmuch as it can not conceive any
                        conditions within <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> framework which
                        would eliminate basic French concern as outlined above. Thus on labor
                        practices, Brunet expressed view Indian conditions probably inferior to
                        those of Japan. No thought has been given evaluation of Japanese trade
                        practices. He anticipates despite French abstinence necessary majority will
                        be found in <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> to make Japanese accession
                        possible in event of which present French view is France would rely on
                        article 35 and refrain from entering into negotiations with Japan.</p>
                    <p>Embassy officers pointed to possible unfortunate political and economic
                        consequences this negative French position. They remarked that French
                        abstention without accompanying stipulation of any conditions under which
                        France might endorse Japanese accession would seem to accord Japan no
                        criteria for guidance as to modifications in her economic and trade policy,
                        fulfillment of which would permit her to enter western community of nations
                        and be treated on basis of equality. On contrary such negative position
                        would appear to imply that under no circumstances could France ever envisage
                        Japan as an acceptable trading partner. Such implication might well have
                        adverse effect on political relations between two countries and prejudice
                        such economic and financial negotiations including Japanese debts as are now
                        going on. Moreover to treat Japan as pariah excluding her in principle from
                        equality of opportunity to trade in western world would seem likely to
                        complicate prospects for continued Japanese adherence to <gloss

                        American selling price, the general simplification of our existing tariff
                        classifications, the elimination of discriminatory internal taxes and the
                        like?</p>

                    <p>Treasury is divided on the issue. The customs people in Treasury have been
                        pushing for a fairly limited, customs simplification bill, feeling that even
                        such a bill would be a substantial improvement over the present situation
                        and that any more ambitious bill would fail of passage completely, with a
                        resulting loss of even noncontroversial reforms. Andy Overby and the people
                        in the Office of International <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0159"
                        />Finance in Treasury favor a stronger, customs improvement bill, feeling
                        that the present difficulties in the field of customs administration require
                        such a bill and that once a customs bill has been passed, it would be very
                        difficult to come back later and obtain additional legislation even if the
                        earlier bill were not adequate.</p>
                    <p>We have also been inclined to support a stronger bill for these reasons. As
                        regards the feasibility of passage of such a bill, we have been impressed by
                        the substantial sentiment among business groups and others for customs
                        reform. We have argued that how strong a bill could be gotten through the
                        Congress depends on the extent to which the Administration is prepared to
                        support such an approach and that, therefore, the issue should be presented
                        to the President and the heads of the interested agencies (notably Treasury,
                        Commerce and State) in the form of a fairly inclusive bill. We appreciate
                        that if a strong bill is put up to the Congress, it might be harder to get
                        through than a weak bill. We have not felt, however, that if a strong bill
                        should be put up to the Congress and the latter should be unreceptive to it,
                        all would necessarily be lost as the proponents of a weak bill have tended
                        to argue. If the Congress were not prepared to accept particular
                        controversial provisions, it could always drop them and enact the rest.
                        There are risks of delay and perhaps even of complete failure but they do
                        not seem to us as great as the possible gains if the Administration were
                        prepared to press for a strong bill.</p>
                    <p>We have tried to define in the attached paper<note n="2" xml:id="d40fn2">Not
                            printed.</note> a possible minimum and maximum approach. The minimum
                        approach would start with the Customs Bill as it passed the House last year
                        and would add to it a number of noncontroversial items. The maximum approach
                        would include all of the minimum approach plus provisions for the
                        elimination of American selling price, the repeal of the three cent
                        processing tax on coconut oil, the repeal of certain discriminatory internal
                        revenue taxes, the granting of equal treatment for foreign and domestic
                        seed, the modification of present requirements for the prohibition of
                        imports from a country affected by the hoof and mouth disease and perhaps
                        one or two other items of lesser importance. Although not discussed in our
                        paper, the maximum bill would also include: (a) a provision for the repeal
                        of Section 516(b) of the Tariff Act<note n="3" xml:id="d40fn3">Reference is
                            to the Tariff Act of 1930 (Public Law 361), enacted June 17, 1930; for

                        classifications in the courts, a section which had been repealed, so far as
                        trade agreement rates were concerned, in 1934 and restored <pb n="134"
                            xml:id="pg_134" facs="0160"/>in the last extension of the Trade
                        Agreements Act<note n="4" xml:id="d40fn4">The last extension referred to
                            here was the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951.</note> and which
                        serves only protectionist purposes by stimulating further litigation and
                        thereby hindering trade; and (b) some provision for simplifying our present
                        complicated tariff structure and alleviating the problems arising from the
                        classification of commodities for the purpose of application of duties.
                        These last two matters had not been dealt with in our customs paper because
                        we had thought of handling them in connection with the renewal of the Trade
                        Agreements Act rather than in a customs improvement bill but on further
                        reflection they would probably fall more appropriately into a customs bill
                        than a trade act.</p>
                    <p>The classification problem perhaps deserves a further word. Our present
                        tariff structure is exceedingly complicated with a bias towards maximizing
                        the amount of protection accorded, and leads to delays and uncertainties and
                        endless litigation in the courts. In the fiscal year 1952 alone nearly
                        30,000 cases were received in the Customs Courts; at the end of fiscal 1952
                        approximately 146,000 cases were pending in the courts. As the Bell report
                        on trade policy now in draft will point out, “litigation may be regarded as
                        an integral part of the process of final settlement of obligations on import
                            entries”.<note n="5" xml:id="d40fn5">The report, entitled “A Trade and
                            Tariff Policy in the National Interest,” was submitted to President
                            Eisenhower in February 1953, by the Public Advisory Board for Mutual
                            Security. Daniel W. Bell, President of the American Security and Trust
                            Company and former Under Secretary of the Treasury, was the acting
                            chairman of the <gloss target="#t_PAB1">PAB</gloss>, which included
                            businessmen, labor leaders, scholars, journalists, and farm
                            spokesmen.</note> This problem was not dealt with in the Customs
                        Simplification Bill submitted to Congress by the Administration last year
                        and as a result leaves an extremely important part, perhaps even a major
                        part, of the problem of customs reform untouched. There is attached a
                            paper,<note n="6" xml:id="d40fn6">Not found with the source text.</note>
                        prepared by the Department for the <gloss target="#t_PAB1">PAB</gloss>,
                        which more fully describes the problem and contains, on pp. 6–7, a specific
                        suggestion for dealing with it. (I should warn you that the introductory
                        Summary of the paper prepared by the <gloss target="#t_PAB1">PAB</gloss>
                        Staff is inadequate.)</p>
                    <p>Since our talk with Treasury a compromise approach for new customs
                        legislation has been suggested to Mr. Overby by members of his staff. Under
                        this approach the Administration would send up to Congress a minimum bill,
                        much like the minimum bill suggested in the attached paper. At the time of
                        submission of the bill, however, the President would indicate that the
                        measure he is suggesting is strictly a customs simplification bill, that
                        more is needed in the field of customs improvement, and that he is,
                        therefore, setting up <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0161"/>an advisory
                        committee of business men to recommend to him additional measures for
                        legislative action.</p>
                    <p>While this approach has some merit in keeping the issue alive, we think it is
                        far less desirable than a strong bill. We know what additional measures are
                        needed and do not need a committee to tell us. The real issue is whether the
                        Administration wants to take on the political fight involved in getting
                        comprehensive customs improvement legislation. Only if the Administration
                        decides not to seek such comprehensive legislation, would it be worth
                        considering the compromise approach suggested to Overby.</p>

                    <p>Since Treasury is pushing ahead quickly to jell on the nature of a bill, we
                        think it would be highly desirable if you could get together at the earliest
                        possible date with Overby and Treasury’s new Assistant Secretary Rose.<note

                        based upon the result of an investigation made under Section 7 of the Trade
                        Agreements Extension Act of 1951 with respect to imported brier pipes and

                        Manufacturers Association on December 29, 1951.</p>
                    <p>The Commission found that, partly as a result of tariff reductions,
                        low-priced brier pipes and bowls are being imported into the United States
                        in such increasing quantities as to cause serious injury to the domestic
                        industry.</p>
                    <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0162"/>
                    <p>The Commission’s recommendation, which was unanimous, would increase the
                        present tariff rates from a range of 46 to 76 percent, where they now stand,
                        to a range of about 46 to 113 percent ad valorem.</p>
                    <p>The Department recommends that the President reject the Tariff Commission’s
                        proposal, for the reasons described below.</p>
                    <p>The country which would be most affected if the United States took this
                        action is Italy, and the part of Italy where pipes are made is the
                        distressed south, an area of chronic poverty already infiltrated with strong
                        domestic Communist influences and an area where active Russian propaganda
                        forces are at work. By a curious coincidence this part of Italy has already
                        suffered from nearly every one of our recently imposed import
                        restrictions—almonds, cheese and figs. This area is also the one which has
                        suffered from United States subsidization or dumping of exports of almonds,
                        oranges and raisins, thus underselling Italy’s exports in third-country
                        markets. Other parts of Italy were also hit by our import restrictions on
                        fur-felt hat bodies which have been in effect for about two years. In short,
                        certain aspects of our economic foreign policy have already created a
                        situation of weakness in our mutual security system in this area. Communist
                        agents are certain to use this example of the unwillingness of the United
                        States to make economic self-help a reality in Southern Italy to undermine
                        confidence in United States leadership.</p>
                    <p>Elections are to be held in Italy later this spring. The moderate coalition
                        government now in power was elected in 1948 by a majority of about 62
                        percent of the votes cast. Now, on the basis of the 1951–52 provincial
                        elections, the bloc of center parties is expected to receive an extremely
                        slim (51 percent) popular majority in the parliamentary elections. If this
                        group fails to win more than 50 percent of the popular vote, the results
                        will be extremely serious for the United States and a period of governmental
                        paralysis and governmental instability may be anticipated.</p>
                    <p>Whether the action proposed by the Tariff Commission is important enough to
                        warrant any additional risks in this extremely sensitive situation is
                        therefore a major consideration and one which I strongly submit should weigh
                        heavily against the proposal.</p>
                    <p>The issue is, however, broader than our relations with Italy and is even
                        broader than the direct tie-in between the proposal and the success of
                        Communist propaganda. Because this is the first case of its kind which will
                        be decided by this Administration, there has been very widespread interest
                        in its disposition; in fact, the action will inevitably be taken as
                        indicative of the meaning of the President’s statements on foreign trade in
                        the Inaugural Address and in the State of the Union message. The French (who
                        have a smaller <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0163"/>direct interest in
                        pipes), the British, the Germans, the Japanese and all others who are on the
                        lookout for signs of coming policy will be heartened or discouraged out of
                        all proportion to the real significance of the action because of its
                        possible future implications. Within the country, it would be very difficult
                        to convince anyone that expansion of trade lies ahead if a marginal industry
                        already enjoying protection far above average is able to obtain still
                        further protection in the fact of the known international political
                        importance of not taking the action.</p>
                    <p>The weaknesses of the economic case on which the proposal is based would make
                        the action even more unfortunate. The pipe industry has undoubtedly suffered
                        difficulties, but the Tariff Commission report leaves the way open to the
                        conclusion that these difficulties were mainly associated with the post-war
                        retrenchment of an industry which enjoyed a temporary boom during the war as
                        a combined result of a cigarette shortage, increased pipe-smoking by men in
                        the services, vast purchases of pipes in anticipation of Army post-exchange
                        demand, and the shutting off of normal imports. The end of the war,
                        resumption of an earlier trend away from pipe-smoking in favor of
                        cigarette-smoking, the unloading of a government surplus of pipes and
                        resulting chaotic price conditions in early postwar years did undoubtedly
                        drive a number of weaker firms and war babies out of business. The Tariff
                        Commission in its report does not seem to have considered the Government
                        surplus as significant in the retrenchment period, although the quantity
                        unloaded is estimated at upward of four million pipes, a figure equal to
                        total imports in the years 1947–50 inclusive.</p>
                    <p>Although the return of imports may have contributed to the distress of the
                        industry, it is significant that according to the Commission’s report the
                        industry seems to have been recovering from its worst troubles during the
                        last two or three years, when imports have been largest. The Commission’s
                        report states that 1949 was the worst year, but imports in that year were
                        less than in 1950, when better profits results were shown. In 1951 profits
                        were larger and were more widely experienced, though imports again were
                        larger.</p>
                    <p>In short, ample explanation for early post-war problems is to be found in
                        factors unrelated to imports, which had in fact not yet regained their old
                        importance. In the more recent period, imports have increased but the
                        industry seems to be doing better rather than worse. Quite apart, therefore,
                        from the political effects of the proposed action on our Foreign Relations,
                        this action does not appear justifiable as a necessary measure to prevent
                        serious injury <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0164"/>from imports within

                        addition there are strong foreign-policy considerations against taking the

                    <p>During the past few months there has been a considerable amount of
                        re-examination within the Department of the policy of the United States with
                        respect to foreign trade. This re-examination has been stimulated by a
                        number of factors including the expiration on June 12, 1953 of the
                        President’s authority to enter into new trade agreements under the Trade
                        Agreements Act, the study of this subject by the Public Advisory Board set
                        up by President Truman, the continuation of balance of payments difficulties
                        of the major European trading countries at a time when various types of
                        financial assistance from the United States are being, or are likely to be,
                        reduced substantially and, since last November, the forthcoming change of

                    <p>Since the original enactment of the Trade Agreements Act on June 12,
                            1934<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2">The Trade Agreements Act (Public Law
                            316), enacted June 12, 1934, was embodied in Section 350 of the revised
                            Tariff Act of 1930 and entitled “Promotion of Foreign Trade;” for text,
                            see 48 Stat. 943.</note> the policy of the United States with regard to
                        foreign trade has become largely centered around that act and the <pb
                            n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0165"/>agreements concluded pursuant to
                        it. Under the act the President is authorized to proclaim limited reductions
                        in duties, and, in very general language, other regulations as to trade, in
                        order to carry out trade agreements. The authority to conclude new
                        agreements to be carried out under this Act expires periodically and has in
                        each case been renewed following examination by the Congress of action by
                        the Executive under the statute. Agreements in effect are not directly
                        affected by the time limitation upon the President’s authority to conclude
                        new agreements, although the statute requires that, following an initial
                        period of not more than three years, agreements must be terminable on not
                        more than six months’ notice.</p>
                    <p>Pursuant to rather general language in the original statute elaborate
                        procedures were gradually developed with respect to the negotiation of trade
                        agreements. The policy-making body with respect to trade agreement matters
                        is the Interdepartmental Trade Agreements Committee, now constituted by
                        Executive Order, the chairman of which is the Chief of the Commercial Policy
                        staff in the Department of State. Its membership consists of representatives
                        from the Departments of the Treasury, Defense, Interior, Agriculture, and
                        Commerce, Labor, and from the Mutual Security Administration, and of a
                        Commissioner of the Tariff Commission (acting in an individual capacity).
                        Operating through interdepartmental subcommittees when considering matters
                        requiring a large amount of research, this committee examines in detail
                        practically all questions relating to trade-agreement matters, and, where
                        appropriate, makes recommendations to the President as to action to be
                        taken.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Tariff Rates</hi></p>
                    <p>The original Trade Agreements Act authorized the President to increase or
                        decrease rates of duty by not more than 50% of the existing rate or to
                        provide for the continuation of existing customs treatment, that is, the
                        so-called binding of rates against increase or the binding of duty-free
                        treatment. As World War II was drawing to a close, trade agreements
                        legislation in 1945, extending for three years the President’s authority to
                        conclude agreements, authorized reductions in duty of 50% of the rate in
                        effect January 1, 1945, that is reductions to 25% of the 1934 rate in cases
                        in which the latter had been reduced by the full 50% permitted in the
                        original legislation. This authority has been utilized for the major trade
                        agreement negotiations in connection with a General Agreement on Tariffs and
                        Trade, at Geneva in 1947, at Annecy, France, in 1949, and at Torquay,
                        England, in 1950–51.</p>
                    <p>A major negotiating problem which is expected to arise in the near future
                        will be our first tariff negotiation under the Trade <pb n="140"
                            xml:id="pg_140" facs="0166"/>Agreements Act with Japan, the application
                        for the accession of which to the General Agreement is now under preliminary
                        consideration by parties to that agreement These parties are also examining
                        in a preliminary manner various proposals for general schemes of tariff
                        reduction under which participating countries would make certain percentage
                        reductions in the average rates of their tariffs applicable to specified
                        categories of products. The extent of flexibility which a country would have
                        under these plans to retain high duties on particular products depends, to a
                        large extent, upon the number of products included within the various
                        categories to which the percentage of reduction would be applied.</p>
                    <p>These possible negotiations within the next few years, together with the
                        growing emphasis on the need for more exports from European countries to
                        dollar areas, particularly the United States, at a time when direct
                        financial assistance is being reduced, have led to examination of various
                        possibilities of including in the Trade Agreements Act additional authority
                        for the reduction of tariffs. Considerable authority still remains for the
                        reduction of duties on various imports of particular interest to Japan as a
                        result of the policy usually followed in the negotiation of trade agreements
                        of not granting concessions to one country covering products of which
                        another country is the principal supplier.</p>
                    <p>For example, in addition to the possibility of permitting rates to be cut by
                        50% of the rate in effect on some new base date, as January 1, 1953, thought
                        is being given to authorizing the reduction of duties between 30% ad valorem
                        and 40% ad valorem to 30% ad valorem, duties between 20% ad valorem and 30%
                        to 20% ad valorem, et cetera. Any such formula as the latter raises problems
                        as to specific duties, that is, duties imposed at so much per unit of
                        measure, and duties which are in part specific. Either the above formula
                        could be applied to the ad valorem equivalent of the specific duties on a
                        particular date, or some other formula, as that of authorizing 50%
                        reductions, would have to be applied to them.</p>
                    <p>The existing Trade Agreements Act, which was originally enacted during the
                        depression in 1934, gives as the one purpose for concluding the agreements
                        the expanding of markets for exports from the United States. In negotiating
                        trade agreements under this act an attempt has usually been made to strike a
                        fairly even balance between the concessions obtained for United States
                        exports and the concessions granted for exports from other countries. In
                        view of the particular need currently for exports to the United States from
                        other countries in balance of payments difficulties, it is believed by many
                        that this criteria of even balance and emphasizing only markets for United
                        States exports, is no longer adequate.</p>
                    <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0167"/>
                    <p>In addition to the consideration of much broader foreign policy objectives as
                        purposes for which trade agreements may be entered into under the Trade
                        Agreements Act, consideration is also being given to the possibility of
                        tariff reductions being made, either by Congress or the Executive other than
                        as a part of negotiated trade agreements. One proposal has been that
                        Congress reduce to 50% ad valorem, or the equivalent thereof, all rates in
                        excess of that rate and that the Executive be given authority thereafter to
                        reduce any tariff rate to 10% ad valorem (or to 12½ ad valorem which is
                        understood to be the approximate average level of our tariff) or to the ad
                        valorem equivalent of any such rate in the case of specific duties. At least
                        one-half of this reduction by the Executive would have to be pursuant to
                        trade agreements of the type heretofore concluded; the other half could be
                        reduced by the Executive without requiring the usual type of trade-agreement
                        commitment from the other country. Since some of the measures which the
                        United States may wish to try to persuade other countries to adopt, such as
                        reforms in their internal fiscal policies, are not the type of measures to
                        which they would be willing to bind themselves in formal agreements, it has
                        been proposed that the Executive be given this authority to make unilateral
                        reductions in particular cases, presumably where other countries adopt such
                        measures, without formal commitments on either side.</p>
                    <p>Another rather complicated proposal for unilateral action would be the
                        grouping of products into related classifications, and the determination of
                        the average rate now applicable to products in each group. Then the rate for
                        all products in the group would be fixed at 40% ad valorem if the average
                        were above 40%, at 30% ad valorem if the average were between 30% and 40%,
                        et cetera. Special treatment would be given to specific rates, to rates
                        which were wholly or partly specific, and to rates on products of particular
                        strategic significance.</p>
                    <p>In view of the talk of an early adjournment by Congress and in view of the
                        importance of some of the other trade problems which are discussed below,
                        there may, be considerable likelihood at this session of a simple extension
                        of the authority to conclude trade agreements, or at least of action without
                        increased authority to reduce tariffs. Some opportunity may be presented for
                        adding to the law in some form one or more of the following new bases for
                        tariff reduction: <list>

                    <p>Although the provisions of the Trade Agreements Act itself are directed
                        principally to authority to reduce duties, the Act also authorizes the
                        modification of import restrictions, the imposition of new restrictions and
                        the continuation of existing customs treatment. Most of the 30-odd bilateral
                        trade agreements which were concluded between 1934 and 1946 contain, in
                        addition to provisions putting into effect the reductions and bindings of
                        duties, rather extensive provisions relating to other trade controls, many
                        of them designed to protect the tariff concessions from impairment. The most
                        important of these were prohibitions, with specified exceptions, against the
                        imposition of quantitative restrictions on the importation of products on
                        which tariff concessions had been granted, most-favored-nation treatment
                        with respect to duties and restrictions on importation, and national
                        treatment as to the taxation of imported products. Occasionally various
                        provisions of this nature had been referred to with approval in the reports
                        of Congressional committees recommending extension of the President’s
                        authority to enter into new trade agreements.</p>
                    <p>During and after the second World War the United States took the leadership
                        in attempting to work out a multilateral code of international trade
                        practices to be administered by an organization. A preparatory committee, to
                        work out the charter of this organization for submission to a world
                        conference, was set up by the Economic and Social Council of the United
                        Nations in 1946. That preparatory committee decided at its first session in
                        1946 that, in addition to work on the draft charter for the International
                        Trade Organization, negotiations for reduction of tariffs should be
                        undertaken at its second session to be held at Geneva in 1947, without
                        waiting for completion of the charter. The report of a drafting committee
                        set up by this first session contained a preliminary draft of the agreement
                        which might be concluded at the end of such tariff negotiations, which would
                        provisionally contain most of the articles of the draft charter relating to
                        commercial policy. These were in general an elaboration, on a multilateral
                        basis, of the general rules and exceptions thereto contained in bilateral
                        trade agreements. The draft tariff agreement also provided for an interim
                        trade committee to carry on various administrative functions in many
                        respects parallel with the functions relating to commercial policy <pb
                            n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0169"/>which it was envisaged would
                        subsequently be carried on by the organization under the draft charter.</p>
                    <p>On the eve of the Geneva Session of the preparatory committee, the Finance
                        Committee of the Republican 80th Congress held hearings on the draft of the
                        Charter to be considered at that meeting. In the course of such hearings
                        some attention was given by the committee to the draft tariff agreement. The
                        view was expressed by Senator Milliken, then and now Chairman of the Finance
                        Committee, that although it had been stated that the Charter of the
                        International Trade Organization would be brought back to Congress, as had
                        been the charters of numerous other organizations, the tariff agreement was
                        an attempt to set up a comparable organization without obtaining
                        Congressional approval. The Finance Committee was assured that this would
                        not be done, and that no provisions of the tariff agreement would purport to
                        override existing legislation.</p>
                    <p>The tariff agreement was negotiated in 1947 under the name of the General
                        Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and came into effect in January 1948. The
                        references in the draft to action by the interim trade committee were
                        changed to action by the contracting parties to the agreement acting
                        jointly, and provision was made that most of the general rules applicable to
                        trade, as distinguished from the tariff concessions for which there was more
                        specific authority in the Trade Agreements Act, would be applicable only to
                        the extent not inconsistent with existing legislation.</p>
                    <p>It had been anticipated that upon the entry into force of the Charter for the
                        International Trade Organization most of the general rules governing trade
                        contained in the General Agreement would be superseded by the comparable
                        provisions of the Charter, and that the General Agreement would remain
                        principally as an agreement applying the tariff concessions negotiated from
                        time to time. However, the International Trade Organization was never set
                        up, and these general rules have remained in the General Agreement. The
                        contracting parties to the General Agreement have held eight sessions to
                        consider various problems under the agreement relating both to the tariff
                        concessions and the general rules as to trade. They have also held two
                        longer sets of tariff negotiations for the addition of new contracting
                        parties and new tariff concessions, and now have a number of committees to
                        work on matters pending or arising between sessions.</p>
                    <p>Due to this early situation as to the relationship between the General
                        Agreement and the International Trade Organization Charter, to the scope and
                        complexity of the general trade provisions in the multilateral general
                        agreement, and to some extent to the wide imposition by other countries of
                        restrictions on exports from the United States, which are justified on
                        balance-of-payments <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0170"/>grounds under
                        terms of the agreement, many questions have been raised both in Congress and
                        in business groups, regarding the agreement. A number have related to the
                        legal authority for some of its provisions, while others are based on policy
                        considerations. The questions usually single out the General Agreement
                        itself, as distinguished from the trade agreements program as a whole.</p>
                    <p>This feeling was reflected in the statement in the Senate report in 1949
                        recommending extension of the President’s authority to conclude new
                        agreements, following a detailed examination of the General Agreement by
                        Senator Millikin<note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3">Eugene Millikin (R.-Colo.),
                            Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.</note> and officers of this
                        Department, that the favorable report “is not intended to commit the
                        Congress on questions raised by the incorporation of general regulatory
                        provisions in the multilateral trade agreement recently concluded at Geneva
                        or on any other aspect of our foreign trade program”. This was followed by a
                        statement that full consideration of such matters would no doubt be
                        undertaken when the International Trade Organization Charter was submitted
                        to Congress.</p>
                    <p>The Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951, extending, with amendments, the
                        President’s authority to conclude new agreements, contains a separate
                        article stating that “the enactment of this Act shall not be construed to
                        determine or indicate the approval or disapproval by the Congress of the
                        Executive Agreement known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and
                        Trade”.</p>
                    <p>In addition to these general questions, a problem exists with respect to the
                        financing of participation by the United States in the activities of the
                        contracting parties. Since there has been neither express Congressional
                        approval of the agreement nor authorization for any appropriation for this
                        purpose, participation has been financed through the general international
                        contingencies appropriation of the Department of State. If questions should
                        be raised with respect to a continuation of this practice during
                        consideration of the budget of the Department of State considerable
                        embarrassment might be caused to the participation by this country in the
                        activities of the contracting parties.</p>
                    <p>From the above it seems clearly evident that a meeting of the minds with
                        respect to the General Agreement, perhaps with various amendments, should be
                        reached between the Executive and the Congress. The Executive has felt that
                        the President has had ample authority under the Trade Agreements Act and his
                        general authority with respect to the conduct of foreign relations to enter
                        into the General Agreement and to modify its provisions from time to time as
                        amendments were considered appropriate. Consequently, it would seem
                        preferable to have Congress merely authorize appropriation <pb n="145"
                            xml:id="pg_145" facs="0171"/>for participation by the United States in
                        the agreement, or to authorize participation in the contracting parties as
                        an organization. Any such authorization would of course entail a detailed
                        examination of the agreement by the Congress. It might, of course, be quite
                        difficult to obtain from the Congress approval in such a form leaving full
                        discretion with the Executive, even with more or less informal Congressional
                        proposals for amendment of the agreement.</p>
                    <p>It seems likely that, following a minute examination of the General
                        Agreement, Congress would want to express itself in a formal manner as to
                        the agreement as such, presumably approving it subject to its being amended
                        in important respects. Such action might cause considerable difficulty. In
                        the first place, very important parts of the agreement are the schedules of
                        tariff concessions, which on the part of the United States, are clearly
                        within the prior authorization given to the President in the Trade
                        Agreements Act. A basic purpose of that act has been to place tariff making
                        in the hands of the Executive rather than of Congress, and subsequently
                        approval of the whole General Agreement by the Congress would raise
                        important questions as to whether a review of Executive tariff making was
                        not being brought back into the Congress with its attendant dangers.
                        Moreover, such positive action by the Congress now approving the whole
                        agreement would appear to cast serious doubt as to the prior legality of at
                        least parts of the agreement, which has been considered by the Executive as
                        having been validly in effect since 1948.</p>
                    <p>Finally, if the exact text is approved it might be specifically required, or
                        argued by implication, that all protocols of amendment or modifications of
                        the agreement, of which there have been a considerable number (in many
                        instances the modifications have been either relatively minor or of little
                        concern to the United States), should themselves receive formal
                        Congressional approval before they could be accepted by the United States.
                        Such a procedure would greatly delay action by the United States on these
                        documents and appear to take up an unnecessary amount of the time of both
                        the Executive and the Congress.</p>
                    <p>An approach to this problem to which consideration is now being given, which
                        might be a compromise if it seems impossible to obtain simple authorization,
                        is to add to the Trade Agreements Act, either with some express reference to
                        the General Agreement or in a manner applying to all trade agreements,
                        relatively general standards covering general rules as to trade and some of
                        the more important exceptions thereto, which would have to be included in
                        the relevant agreements under that Act. At the same time authorization might
                        be obtained for an appropriation either for participation in the General
                        Agreement or, more generally, for participation <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146"
                            facs="0172"/>in continuing administrative arrangements for carrying out
                        a trade agreement. It is hoped that the formulation of such standards by
                        Congress, which might well require the amendment of the General Agreement in
                        some respects, would be considered by the Congressional critics of the
                        agreement as sufficient participation by the Congress, and that the more
                        formal submission of the agreement as such for approval could be
                        avoided.</p>
                    <p>It is felt by some that the general rules as to trade in the General
                        Agreement, as well as in the International Trade Organization, are too
                        complicated, and it has been proposed that the General Agreement be reduced
                        to an agreement putting into effect the tariff concessions. It would then be
                        supplemented by a purely consultative organization with respect to trade
                        matters which could make recommendations as to the general rules but without
                        any binding rules and exceptions such as are now in the General Agreement.
                        The general feeling within the Department seems to be that this would be a
                        most unfortunate backward step. In the first place, many of the general
                        rules in the agreement are important to prevent, or at least limit, evasion
                        of the tariff concessions through the imposition of other trade controls.
                        Moreover, most of the detailed rules and procedures, including provisions
                        for action by the contracting parties acting jointly, relate not to the
                        laying down of additional obligations but are exceptions to relatively
                        simple general rules.</p>
                    <p>There are practically no instances in which the contracting parties acting
                        jointly could tell the United States that they must take certain action; on
                        the other hand, the United States has utilized in many instances provisions
                        of the agreement permitting flexibility, notably to obtain a complete
                        release from its obligations to Czechoslovakia under the agreement, in order
                        to put into effect Congressional desires. In practice the contracting
                        parties attempt to assist individual countries in working out their
                        difficulties with each other, frequently making recommendations as well as
                        interpretations of the General Agreement. Of course, as in the case of
                        participation in almost any multilateral agreement, the United States
                        becomes only a minority of one when questions of interpretation are
                        involved.</p>
                    <p>Although the authority of the contracting parties acting jointly is generally
                        limited to the interpretation of obligations which an individual party has
                        undertaken in the agreement, rather than to placing any new requirements
                        upon a party, there are a number of instances under which sanctions may be
                        applied in the form of retaliatory action by injured contracting parties
                        which would not otherwise be permitted under the agreement. In most cases
                        the retaliation must be approved by the contracting parties acting jointly.
                            <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0173"/>These retaliatory provisions
                        have been utilized very sparingly, but it is felt that their existence gives
                        a vitality to the conduct of business by the contracting parties which would
                        be absent if their meetings should be replaced by a purely consultative
                        body.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Quantitative Restrictions</hi></p>
                    <p>In order to protect the concessions which had been granted on particular
                        products in the schedules annexed thereto, most of the bilateral trade
                        agreements contained prohibitions, subject to specified exceptions, against
                        the imposition of quantitative restrictions on the importation of such
                        products. The exceptions usually included permission to impose restrictions
                        in connection with various agricultural programs.</p>
                    <p>At the time the General Agreement was entered into Section 22 of the
                        Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended,<note n="4" xml:id="d42fn4">Section
                            22 was enacted into law on Aug. 24, 1935, as one provision of the
                            amended Agricultural Adjustment Act (Public Law 318) and was reenacted
                            on June 3, 1937, as part of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of
                            1937 (Public Law 137). For texts, see 49 Stat. 773 and 50 Stat.

                        agricultural products when he found such restrictions necessary to prevent
                        imports from materially interfering with certain agricultural programs,
                        including programs in which domestic production or marketing was restricted.
                        The General Agreement contains a broad prohibition against quantitative
                        restrictions on imports of any product, whether or not included in the
                        schedules to the agreement, but subject to various exceptions. Among these
                        is an exception for agricultural products in cases in which domestic
                        production or marketing is also restricted. However, in such cases the
                        import restrictions may not under the Agreement reduce the proportion of
                        domestic consumption that may be supplied by imports below the proportion
                        thereof during a previous representative period.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after the General Agreement went into effect Section 22 of the
                        Agricultural Adjustment Act was further amended<note n="5" xml:id="d42fn5"
                            >Section 22 of the Agricultural Act of 1948 (Public Law 897), enacted
                            July 3, 1948; for text, see 62 Stat. 1249.</note> to require the
                        imposition of quantitative restrictions if imports were likely to interfere
                        with any price support program, in many of which there are now no provisions
                        for the restriction of domestic production or marketing. At the same time a
                        new subsection was added to the effect that Section 22 should not be applied
                        in any manner which would conflict with an international obligation of the
                        United States. The latter provision, protecting international obligations,
                        has subsequently been practically reversed by Congress so that now it
                        provides, in effect, that no international obligations shall prevent the
                        application of Section 22. Although there have <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148"
                            facs="0174"/>been no proclamations issued under this new Section 22 in
                        order to prevent imports from interfering with a price support program under
                        which there is no restriction of domestic production or marketing, the
                        Tariff Commission now has under consideration a proposed application of
                        Section 22 with respect to wool which would raise problems of this nature if
                        it should lead to Presidential action putting into effect quantitative
                        restrictions on imported wool.</p>
                    <p>It is recognized that action by the Government which has the effect of
                        maintaining a relatively high price for agricultural commodities tends to
                        make this market a particularly attractive one for imports, and therefore to
                        attract imports which add to the cost to the Government of maintaining its
                        price support program. Recognizing the validity of the arguments for the
                        imposition of some quantitative restrictions in this type of situation,
                        consideration is being given to a change in our policy, which would involve
                        a change in the General Agreement, to permit restrictions in such a case
                        provided they do not reduce the proportion of the American market supplied
                        by imports below that proportion which they would normally have supplied. In
                        other words imports may not come in merely to replace domestic production,
                        but may come in to maintain their proportionate share of any increase in
                        domestic consumption. This new approach would also require a modification of
                        Section 22, which now permits the limitation of imports to 50% of the
                        quantity imported during a previous representative period rather than to
                        100% of the proportion of domestic consumption supplied by imports during
                        such a period, as would be the limit under the new proposal.</p>
                    <p>Another important exception in the General Agreement for agricultural
                        interests is that relating to commodity agreements, which covers other raw
                        materials as well. Before World War II the United States was a party to
                        commodity agreements designed to assist in maintaining fair prices for sugar
                        and coffee. Although the substantive provisions of these agreements have
                        lapsed, a conference is scheduled for next summer to consider a new sugar
                        agreement, and the wheat agreement, which has been in effect for about four
                        years, is currently under renegotiation. Some consideration has also been
                        given since the war to agreements on tin and cotton.</p>
                    <p>In 1947 the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations laid down
                        principles that should be applied in the conclusion of commodity agreements,
                        including the representation therein of both producing and consuming
                        interests. These principles, together with procedures for studies which
                        might lead to commodity agreements, were embodied in a commodity chapter of
                        the International Trade Organization Charter. The General Agreement contains
                        no express statement of the principles, but excepts from the general <pb
                            n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0175"/>prohibitions against restrictions
                        on importation and exportation, measures undertaken pursuant to an agreement
                        conforming to the principles laid down by the Economic and Social
                        Council.</p>
                    <p>The policy of the United States has been to limit commodity agreements to
                        cases in which there was an actual threat of a burdensome surplus. The
                        current thinking, however, is that such agreements may be justified for
                        commodities the general history as to the production of which shows a
                        likelihood that a burdensome surplus might develop at some time in the
                        future, even though there is no present threat of such a surplus.</p>
                    <p>The basic economic difficulty between the United States and Europe since the
                        War—the serious dollar balance-of-payments deficits of most European
                        countries—has left its mark on the General Agreement and on the operations
                        under it. The Agreement permits the imposition of quantitative restrictions
                        by a country to protect its reserve position, and, in rather vague language,
                        permits countries imposing such restrictions for balance-of-payments reasons
                        to discriminate in their application. These provisions are quite detailed,
                        more as to the procedures which they set up than as to the substantive rules
                        to be applied. They have been the subject of considerable domestic criticism
                        because of the extent to which they permit countries to impose restrictions,
                        even discriminatory restrictions, against the United States.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the European Recovery Program<note n="6" xml:id="d42fn6"

                        by European countries of their restrictions among themselves while
                        recognizing their right to retain them against the dollar area. There is no
                        doubt that the continuance in effect over a long period of restrictions for
                        balance-of-payments reasons creates a considerable amount of protection for
                        domestic industry and that there are numerous opportunities for abuse of the
                        exceptions. This and other problems relating to these restrictions have been
                        the subject of rather close examination during the more recent meetings of
                        the contracting parties, in a general exploratory fashion rather than
                        through the bringing of particular complaints.</p>
                    <p>The exceptions permitting the balance-of-payments restrictions require their
                        relaxation or removal when the reserve position has been strengthened
                        sufficiently to warrant such a removal. This provision has led to one
                        particular difficult problem with respect principally to the sterling area
                        discussion of which among the Contracting Parties has been seriously
                        avoided. This is the question whether when the trade position of a
                        particular member of the area, as <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0176"
                        />Ceylon, has improved so that when viewed alone it might be considered as
                        being in a position to relax or eliminate its restrictions on the dollar
                        area it should be required to do so without recognizing its obligations
                        under the sterling area arrangement to make available to the sterling area
                        dollar pool a substantial proportion of its dollar earnings. Although this
                        Government has attempted to reserve its rights with respect to this point,
                        its continued failures to press for relaxation or elimination of
                        restrictions in such cases because of the political implications involved
                        seem to weaken its position considerably. Operations under the European
                        Payments Union may lead to comparable conflicts of policy.</p>
                    <p>It was envisaged, at the time the General Agreement was drafted, that the
                        balance-of-payments difficulties following the War would in most cases not
                        continue beyond 1951 and many of the complicated provisions of the agreement
                        relating to the application of restrictions to protect reserves were drafted
                        with such a relatively transitional period in mind. Although this situation
                        has not been cleared up as quickly as had been anticipated, the current
                        feeling is that we should continue to consider such restrictions, and the
                        discriminations in their application, as transitional and operate under them
                        in the expectation that the time will come when they are unnecessary on the
                        return of the general convertibility of currencies. Moreover, there is
                        considerable feeling that these balance-of-payments provisions of the
                        General Agreement are unnecessarily detailed and complicated, principally as
                        to procedures for considering the balance-of-payments problems, and that
                        consequently it would be desirable to replace them by more simplified
                        provisions.</p>
                    <p>Formation of the European Coal and Steel Community, which was supported by
                        the United States for reasons of broad political and military policy,
                        presented particular problems with respect to the discriminatory application
                        of both quantitative restrictions and tariffs. The plan envisages the
                        substantial elimination of trade barriers among the six participating
                        countries with respect to the coal and steel products. Rather broad waiver
                        provisions in the General Agreement were utilized to permit the
                        participating countries to put the community into operation.</p>
                    <p>A particular problem with respect to quantitative restrictions for the United
                        States has been the conflict between the General Agreement and Section 104
                        of the Defense Production Act, first enacted in the summer of 1951. This
                        section requires the imposition of quantitative restrictions on the
                        importation of dairy products and certain other specified imports when it is
                        found that certain situations exist for which there is no exception in the
                        General Agreement. Notwithstanding the fact that Congress, in enacting the
                        legislation, stated that it was necessary for the security interest of the
                            <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0177"/>United States in language
                        following that of the security exception to the General Agreement, the
                        Executive has not considered that there is sufficient relationship between
                        the controls and our security to justify the restrictions which the
                        Secretary of Agriculture has found necessary under this legislation.</p>
                    <p>In the case of most of the restrictions which have been imposed under this
                        legislation, the more important of which have been on cheese, the United
                        States has admitted a violation of the General Agreement, and one injured
                        contracting party has been permitted by the contracting parties jointly
                        under the agreement to retaliate against United States exports of flour.</p>
                    <p>The Executive opposed an enactment of the section, which was inserted in the
                        legislation rather hurriedly at an advanced stage in consideration of the
                        bill. Promptly upon its enactment legislation for its repeal was introduced,
                        but was never passed. In extending the Defense Production Act in the summer
                        of 1952 Congress liberalized the provision somewhat, but without removing
                        the violations of the General Agreement. At that time the Executive had been
                        willing to accept as a compromise language of an earlier act which permitted
                        the imposition of restrictions under situations of surplus or short supply
                        of the products involved. This proposed language follows an exception in the
                        General Agreement applicable originally only to the transitional period
                        prior to 1951, but the application of which is being currently extended by
                        action of the contracting parties jointly.</p>

                    <p>Some of the early bilateral Trade Agreements contained variously worded
                        provisions under which concessions could be withdrawn if imports under them
                        were causing serious injuries to a domestic industry. These culminated in
                        the so-called “escape clause” in the Mexican trade agreement of 1942,<note

                        be withdrawn in case of serious injury or threat thereof to a domestic
                        industry resulting from increased imports under the concession. Moreover,
                        during various discussions regarding trade agreement legislation with
                        Congress statements had also been made that the trade agreements program
                        would not be carried out in such a manner as to cause serious injury. In
                        1945 President Truman wrote to Congress that his administration would follow
                        this policy which had been followed by the Roosevelt administration.</p>
                    <p>Early in 1947, as a result of discussions between an official of the State

                        Order was issued providing that all new trade <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152"
                            facs="0178"/>agreements should contain an escape clause along the lines
                        of that in the Mexican trade agreement. It also set up a procedure whereby
                        Tariff Commission would make investigations in cases in which it was claimed
                        that serious injury might be caused or threatened as a result of a
                        concession in an agreement having such a clause and make recommendations to
                        the President regarding the claim. An escape clause of this type is included

                            Law 792, enacted June 26, 1948; for text, see 62 Stat. 1053.</note>
                        passed by the 80th Congress, added a new phase to the no-serious injury
                        approach. In substance it provided that, before a trade agreement should be
                        entered into, the President should submit to the Tariff Commission a list of
                        the products on which tariff concessions might be granted. The Commission
                        should report the extent to which it considered a concession could be
                        granted on each product in the list without causing or threatening serious
                        injury to an American industry. If the President granted a concession on any
                        product greater than that which the Tariff Commission found could be granted
                        without such injury or threat, he should report his action to Congress and
                        the Tariff Commission should transmit its peril point finding to Congress.
                        These provisions were followed in preparation for the trade agreement
                        negotiations at Annecy in 1949, but were repealed by the Trade Agreement
                        Extension Act of 1949,<note n="10" xml:id="d42fn10">Public Law 307, enacted
                            Sept. 26, 1949; for text, see 63 Stat. 597.</note> enacted by the 81st
                        Congress before the conclusion of the agreement embodying such
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>The Trade Agreement Extension Act of 1951<note n="11" xml:id="d42fn11">Public
                            Law 50, enacted June 16, 1951; for text, see 65 Stat. 72.</note>
                        reenacted the peril point provisions with relatively little change, and also
                        added to the trade agreements legislation provisions regarding escape
                        clauses and action thereunder. In rather ambiguous language it laid down the
                        escape clause principles and required the inclusion of such escape clauses
                        in all such future trade agreements. In addition, it directed action toward
                        the inclusion of escape clauses in existing trade agreements and set up a
                        new procedure for Tariff Commission investigations and recommendations to
                        the President under escape clauses. As in the case of peril point findings,
                        the President is not required to put into effect recommendations of the
                        Tariff Commission for the withdrawal of modification of concessions but if
                        he fails to do so he is required to report his reasons to Congress.</p>
                    <p>Enactment of this legislation was followed by a flood of applications for
                        escape clause action, upon which the Tariff Commission is <pb n="153"
                            xml:id="pg_153" facs="0179"/>required to report within one year. In
                        several cases the Commission had failed to recommend action, in three cases
                        (one preceding the 1951 act) escape clause modifications have been put into
                        effect, and in two cases the President had rejected recommendations,
                        questioning and finding of serious injury or threat thereof. President
                        Eisenhower has deferred action, and requested further information from the
                        Commission, in the only case that has come to him for decision.</p>
                    <p>The reaction abroad, principally in Italy and other Western European
                        countries, to the escape clause actions that have been put into effect has
                        been quite strong. Not only has it been felt that the particular actions
                        interfere with the program for an expansion of exports to the United States
                        by countries so badly in need of dollar earnings, but it is pointed out that
                        the possibility that a future expansion of exports of any product may result
                        in escape clause action has a generally deadening effect upon attempts to
                        stimulate this much needed trade expansion.</p>
                    <p>In view of the unfortunate effect of these escape clause actions,
                        consideration has been given to various means of alleviating the situation.
                        Some would relate to detailed questions of interpreting such terms as
                        “serious injury” under certain circumstances, or to the scope of the concept
                        of an “industry” which might suffer injury. Another approach has been to
                        have a body composed differently from the Tariff Commission take into
                        consideration both the questions of injury and of the broader public
                        interest which may be involved in escape clause actions. A third approach
                        would be only to permit escape clause action when the economy of the United
                        States as a whole, rather than an individual industry, is suffering injury
                        from the imports.</p>
                    <p>Finally, some thought has been given to replacing the “no-injury” concept by
                        provision for making payments by the Government to enterprises injured by
                        tariff reductions. These might include various types of assistance to labor,
                        in the form of dismissal wages or retraining programs, and of assistance to
                        capital either through direct compensation for loss suffered by the
                        enterprise or through a low interest loan (on possibly a grant) to help
                        enterprises to readjust themselves in other lines of activity.</p>
                    <p>In view of the development of the no-injury concept, as previously embodied
                        in the escape clause provision of the 1947 Executive Order and the peril
                        point provision of the 1948 Act, it might be considered doubtful whether
                        substantial change could be gotten. However, realization of the extent to
                        which other countries, particularly in Western Europe, need to increase
                        their exports to the United States would seem to justify the continuing
                        examination of this aspect of the trade agreement program. It might be
                        possible to <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0180"/>obtain at least some
                        substantial relaxation in the criteria to be applied under the escape
                        clause.</p>

                    <p>In 1933 legislation<note n="12" xml:id="d42fn12">Title III of the
                            Appropriations Act of 1933 (Public Law 428), approved Mar. 3, 1933; for
                            text of Act, see 47 Stat. 1489.</note> was enacted requiring, in quite
                        general language, that Government purchases of goods for use in the United
                        States should be of United States products except where the public interest
                        required otherwise or the cost of such products was unreasonably high. For
                        some time the cost of American goods have been considered as unreasonably
                        high if their prices were more than 25% above the prices of available
                        foreign products.</p>
                    <p>Recently, there have been a number of requests by Western European countries,
                        notably the United Kingdom and Italy, with respect to the rejection of bids
                        by producers in those countries at a time when we have encouraged the
                        countries to increase their dollar exports. A bill was introduced during the
                        last session of Congress to repeal this buy-American legislation, and the
                        prevailing thinking in the Department is that this would be the best way of
                        taking care of the problem.</p>
                    <p>Thought is also being given to the possibility of increasing the use of
                        foreign goods through an interpretation that, under existing circumstances,
                        purchase of such foreign products is in the public interest within the
                        meaning of the statute. It has also been suggested that the percentage by
                        which the American price must exceed the foreign price before the American
                        price will be considered unreasonably high might, by interpretation, be
                        reduced below 25%.</p>
                    <p>The Defense Department Appropriation Act for the present fiscal year has a
                        particular provision which in effect requires not only that American
                        textiles be purchased but textiles manufactured from American raw
                        material.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Custom Simplification</hi></p>
                    <p>The Executive introduced into the 81st Congress a Custom Simplification Bill
                        which had been worked out on an interdepartmental basis to include
                        recommendations made by a firm of efficient experts which had investigated
                        the Customs Bureau, and modifications in customs and internal revenue
                        legislation which would be necessary to put the General Agreement into
                        effect definitively (as distinguished from the present application of some
                        ports only to the extent not inconsistent with existing legislation). No
                        action was taken on the bill in the 81st Congress, but it was re-introduced
                        in the 82nd Congress where it passed the House, with important amendments,
                        and hearings were held in the Senate.</p>
                    <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0181"/>
                    <p>It is felt both that provisions deleted by the House were of considerable
                        importance, that there are numerous other modifications which might be added
                        to the earlier bills, some of them proposed during the Senate hearings and
                        considered quite uncontroversial. Consideration is now being given in
                        consultation with the Treasury to pressing for the passage of a broad bill
                        at this session, although it is recognized that another approach would be to
                        have two bills one with the more uncontroversial provisions with a view to
                        having it passed as quickly as possible, and the other containing additional
                        more controversial provisions.</p>
                    <p>Considerable interest has been expressed by some countries, particularly
                        Canada, in these bills, but it is feared that they may overestimate the
                        effect of such a bill, especially if it should be limited to the less
                        controversial provisions.</p>

                    <p>Because of great domestic pressures, the Japanese Government has been
                        persistently seeking some way by which Japan can quickly accede to the
                        General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (<gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss>). Apparently we have finally convinced the Foreign Office
                        that the decision made by the President to request renewal of the Trade
                        Agreements Act for one year only, precludes the full-scale negotiations with
                        the United States normally to be expected before Japan could accede.
                        However, they have informally proposed the following: <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>That the U.S. support early multilateral negotiations of the
                                Annecy type. That is, the present contracting parties would
                                negotiate only with Japan and any other countries which might wish
                                to accede.</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>The United States agree to negotiate bilaterally with Japan, but
                                with the understanding that the United States would only bind some
                                existing rates of duty against increase. The Japanese believe that
                                negotiations in which no reductions in duty were made would be
                                consonant with our commitment to Congress not to enter into
                                “substantial negotiations”. The Japanese might be willing to accede
                                without any additional concessions of any kind—even new
                                bindings.</item>

                    <p>The Japanese have presented us with a thorny problem. It will be necessary to
                        examine the proposal to determine whether the advantages to be gained from
                        such action would be worth the risks incurred. It is recognized that we
                        would have to wait until after the Trade Agreements Act is renewed to commit
                        ourselves to the Japanese, and even then only after reaching agreement with
                        congressional leaders that such negotiations would be consonant with the
                        commitment not to enter into “major negotiations” in the coming year. On the
                        other hand, it is clear that if we refuse the proposal out of hand, United
                        States-Japanese relations would be seriously impaired.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, I think we should suggest to the Secretary that if he is
                        asked at the trade agreements hearing Monday whether we would negotiate with
                        Japan he avoid making a reply which would preclude our agreeing to the
                        Japanese proposal. If you agree, <gloss target="#t_NA1">NA</gloss> will work
                        out with <gloss target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss> an additional “question and
                        answer” to be added to the Secretary’s black book.</p>

                        Japan’s application for accession to <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>.
                        To the Japanese, accession to <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> even on
                        a temporary basis is of the utmost political importance. In addition the
                        Japanese look forward to significant economic benefits from <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> membership, particularly commitments for
                        most-favored-nation treatment which have so far been denied them by
                        important trading nations, for example, the United Kingdom and British
                        Commonwealth countries.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese have suggested full-scale multilateral tariff negotiations which
                        would enable them to qualify for full membership in <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss>. As alternatives they have suggested: (a) bilateral tariff
                        negotiations or (b) temporary membership pending full-scale negotiations.
                        The Japanese intend soon to put before the contracting parties to the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> proposals for either bilateral
                        negotiations or temporary membership. As a temporary member Japan would be
                        brought within the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> framework and would
                        incur both benefits <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0183"/>and
                        obligations, pending later negotiations to determine the conditions under
                        which Japan would accede to <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> as a full
                        member.</p>
                    <p>We consider that either full-scale or bilateral tariff negotiations would be
                        inconsistent with our commitment to the Congress not to use renewed
                        authority under the Trade Agreements Act<note n="1" xml:id="d44fn1">The
                            Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1953 (Public Law 215), which was
                            enacted on Aug. 7, 1953, extended the President’s powers under the Trade
                            Agreements Act for one year ending June 12, 1954; for text, see 67 Stat.

                    <p>In early 1953, largely through United States efforts, the longstanding
                        opposition of the major <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> countries was
                        sufficiently reduced so that they were willing to give serious consideration
                        to non-discriminatory terms for Japan’s accession to <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. It is doubtful, however, whether
                        temporary membership for Japan would be acceptable to those countries since
                        they have stated that, in their view, Japan should accede to <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> only as the result of multilateral tariff
                        negotiations in which the United States and other contracting parties would
                        participate fully and would make Worthwhile tariff concessions to each other
                        as well as to Japan.</p>
                    <p>Regardless of the outcome, the withdrawal of United States support for
                        Japan’s desire to accede to <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> would
                        impair our ability to obtain Japan’s cooperation in such important projects
                        as their defense measures and export security controls. We consider,
                        therefore, that the United States should not discourage Japan from proposing
                        temporary membership.</p>
                    <p>If Japan’s proposal for temporary membership is approved by the contracting
                        parties, Japan incurs both obligations and benefits under the general rules
                        embodied in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. In addition the
                        contracting parties would become obligated to extend to Japanese products,
                        subject to the various escape provisions in the General Agreement, the
                        tariff rates set forth in the schedules of concessions, in return for tariff
                        concessions by Japan. In the case of the United States, existing concessions
                        would be extended to Japan pursuant to the authority of the Trade Agreements
                        Act (See Tab B),<note n="3" xml:id="d44fn3">Not printed.</note> and at the
                        appropriate time public notice of intention to negotiate with Japan would be
                        issued as required by that Act.</p>
                    <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0184"/>
                    <p>No change would result in the present United States tariffs applicable to
                        Japanese goods. The principal effect on the United States of temporary
                        Japanese membership in <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> would be to
                        give Japan the formal right to consultation with regard to United States
                        tariff increases on commodities of interest to Japan. As a matter of policy,
                        we do, however, consult with Japan on tariff matters relating to such
                        products.</p>

                    <p>B. <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> is a multilateral agreement under
                        which the countries which are parties to the Agreement (Contracting Parties)
                        have agreed to various general rules for the conduct of international trade
                        and to specific tariff reductions. It was originally negotiated in 1947.
                        There have been three rounds of tariff reductions (Geneva, 1947–Annecy,
                        1949–Torquay, 1951) and seven business sessions of the Contracting Parties.
                        There are now 33 Contracting Parties accounting for some four-fifths of the
                        world’s trade. Although the United States is a Contracting Party to <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, Congress has made clear on numerous
                        occasions that it reserves its view on the question whether it would approve
                        United States participation.</p>
                    <p>C. <hi rend="italic">Japanese Accession:</hi> For some time Japan has been
                        anxious to accede to the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> in order to
                        obtain benefits possible only through participation in this Agreement. Prior
                        to acceding to <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> a country ordinarily
                        enters into tariff negotiations with other parties which are its major
                        partners in world trade. Under a commitment made to the United States
                        Congress this past winter by the Secretary, the United States is estopped
                        from entering into full-scale negotiations on tariff reductions until after
                        the President’s Commission on Economic Foreign Policy makes its report and
                        new legislation is submitted to the Congress. Japan therefore has requested
                        that it be permitted to accede to <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> on a
                        temporary basis. The preliminary view of the United States, pending final
                        decision after public hearings, has been one of strong support for Japanese
                        accession partly because of the importance of obtaining Japanese cooperation
                        in military security measures, and because of our concern over Japan’s
                        unhealthy dependence on United States assistance. The United States position
                        has met with opposition from other countries, particularly the British, but
                        United States-British talks over the past several months have paved the way
                        for temporary Japanese accession at the forthcoming meeting. The final
                        United States position to be taken is subject to public hearings now being
                        held in the United States. At the meeting we hope that a formula can be
                        developed to permit provisional Japanese accession to the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>D. <hi rend="italic">Extension of Firm Life of Tariff Concessions:</hi>
                        Article XXVIII of the General Agreement provides that on and after January
                        1, 1954 any Contracting Party may withdraw or modify individual tariff
                        concessions. It is feared pressures will be exerted in various countries to
                        raise tariffs and representatives of several foreign governments <pb n="160"
                            xml:id="pg_160" facs="0186"/>have indicated that unless this date is
                        extended their governments will be unable to resist pressure to use the
                        Article.</p>
                    <p>As in the case of Japan, the final United States position is subject to
                        consideration of the results of public hearings currently being held. On the
                        basis of present information, the United States delegation is being
                        instructed to advocate extension of the date from January 1, 1954 to either
                        January 1, 1955 or June 30, 1955 and that no country make changes in
                        existing concessions prior to the change in the date. We would prefer a
                        declaration signed by individual Contracting Parties binding the signers not
                        to invoke Article XXVIII for the extended period, but if this method proves
                        non-negotiable, the United States will sponsor approval of a resolution
                        recommending that each Contracting Party not invoke the Article for a period
                        of either 12 or 18 months.</p>
                    <p>It is felt that extension of the date would help stem the growing feeling of
                        a number of countries that the United States Government is moving toward
                        increased protection for domestic industries. Extension also is consistent
                        with the President’s policy of maintaining the stability of the general
                        tariff situation during this interim period of study of United States
                        foreign economic policy. Considerable international support exists for
                        extending the date. Among others, the Chairman (a Norwegian), France, Canada
                        and Cuba have indicated support for extension. Australia and New Zealand
                        have implied they would like some leeway to raise tariffs on some items.</p>
                    <p>E. <hi rend="italic">United Kingdom Preference Problem:</hi> Under the
                        General Agreement, the United Kingdom is committed not to increase any
                        tariff preference which exists in favor of Commonwealth countries. The
                        United Kingdom has been pressing for a formula under which it would be free
                        to raise its duties on certain items not now bound and imported from outside
                        the Commonwealth, principally horticultural items, without placing a duty on
                        the same class of products which enter free of duty from the Commonwealth.
                        Although consideration of such a matter would be preferable in the context
                        of a general review of the Agreement, protectionist pressures in the United
                        Kingdom have forced the British to request its consideration at this
                        meeting. The United States and the United Kingdom have explored a formula
                        which might meet both the British requirements for a waiver and the
                        limitations desired by the United States. However, the formula may not be
                        acceptable to a number of Western European countries.</p>

                    <p>On September 21, 1953, the Trade Agreements Committee made formal
                        recommendations to the President regarding the issues of Japanese accession
                        to the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and the extension of tariff
                        concessions under Article XXVIII. With regard to Japanese membership in the
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, the Committee recommended that
                        the United States seek agreement from the Contracting Parties for temporary
                        accession based on the extension of <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                        tariff concessions to Japan. In return, Japan would agree to accept the
                        general provisions of the Agreement and to make additional concessions, such
                        as promising not to increase a portion of its tariff schedule. With regard
                        to Article XXVIII, the Committee recommended that the date governing the
                        life of the existing tariff schedules in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> be extended “not less than 12 nor more than 18 months”
                        beyond the existing date of January 1, 1954. The memorandum noted that the
                        representative <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0189"/>from the Department
                        of Agriculture dissented and that the Tariff Commission member abstained
                        from the recommendation. (Memorandum by the Chairman of the Trade Agreements
                        Committee to the President, September 21, 1953, 394.31/9–2353) Both
                        recommendations were delivered to President Eisenhower under cover of
                        concurring memoranda from Under Secretary of State Smith, dated September
                        21, 1953, and received President Eisenhower’s approval on September 23,

                        following points that he might care to make in his presentation to the
                        Randall Commission at its Paris meeting on November 9.</p>
                    <p>1. To stress that extent to which movement by other countries toward
                        convertibility and multilateral trade and, particularly, the key country of
                        Britain, depends upon policy decisions by the U.S.</p>
                    <p>We hear this theme continually in London, and it has been a recurrent motif
                        throughout this entire meeting of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                        >GATT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>2. To stress the extent to which this is a problem of confidence and
                        psychology.</p>
                    <p>These countries not only want the U.S. to go forward; they want concrete
                        assurance that it will not go backward.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. customs restrictions, agricultural restrictions and Buy-American Act
                        are bad enough, but what is as bad—and in my opinion worse—as a barrier to
                        trade is the psychological attitude that has grown up around them in the
                        minds of European and other countries. There is a combination of feeling
                        that to try to get into the U.S. market is impossible and a fear that, even
                        if you succeed, further barriers will then be raised against you. There is
                        no real <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0190"/>confidence that we
                        genuinely mean to accept greater competition from imports.</p>
                    <p>This attitude of mind inhibits action even by the energetic exporters. It
                        provides a convenient alibi for those who do not particularly want to try to
                        compete.</p>
                    <p>Our need is somehow to inspire confidence and hope in the energetic, and to
                        remove the alibi of the lethargic. To my mind this is the most important
                        element in the picture, even more important probably than the actual measure
                        of tariff reductions we might make or restrictive laws that we might modify
                        or abolish.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, now is the time, the opportunity par excellence, for us to do what
                        is necessary in this respect, for we are now at the beginning of the first
                        Republican Administration in twenty years. If a broadly based,
                        forward-looking program could be adopted by a large majority in a Republican
                        Congress, it would go far toward meeting the need.</p>
                    <p>3. Two or three things would be indispensable to create this impression. The
                        first would be that we should abandon the emphasis we have hitherto placed
                        upon strict reciprocity in tariff bargaining. If we could, for example,
                        announce that except for a few specified cases, dictated perhaps by needs of
                        national security, there would be no tariff in the U.S. over 50%, that would
                        make a drastic impression and would be something that I would think would be
                        supported by most intelligent people in the U.S. We could then bargain our
                        moderate and low rates against other countries’ moderate and low rates in
                        the normal way.</p>
                    <p>Tariff negotiation on the basis of straight reciprocity is outmoded in other
                        countries as well as with us. That is the basis of the whole long discussion
                        which has gone on between the high and low tariff countries in Europe and
                        which has culminated in the so-called “French Plan” for tariff reduction
                        which has been worked out by experts in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss>, a copy of which is enclosed. The essence of this plan is
                        that the bargain would be that each country would agree to reduce its
                        tariffs by a certain percentage over a period of time. The percentage would
                        be allocated by groups of imports in order to give flexibility for
                        protection in necessary cases. Countries with tariffs below a certain level
                        would have to do no more than agree not to raise their present rates. The
                        reciprocity would come not in the action on individual items, but on the
                        overall action by each country in return for comparable overall action by
                        the others.</p>
                    <p>I do not think it is feasible to eliminate the “escape clause”,<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d48fn3">For background on the “escape clause” in U.S. trade
                            agreements legislation, see the appropriate section of the Metzger

                            151</ref>.</note> but I do think it would be feasible and consistent
                        with the spirit of the <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0191"/>“escape
                        clause” to say that if action under it has not been taken within a limit of
                        say three years, the rate must thereafter remain fixed. This would give
                        plenty of time for industries to adjust to reduced rates and to see what the
                        effect of the adjustments would mean. It would also give confidence to
                        exporters that after a certain period at least they could proceed with
                        confidence.</p>
                    <p>A beginning should be made on a complete review of our tariff
                        classifications. These are the real source of customs delay because of the
                        litigation to which they lead.</p>
                    <p>The Buy-American Act should be repealed.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> should be approved by the
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>And finally, some formula should be found whereby the operation of U.S. price
                        support programs for agricultural commodities would not result in total
                        exclusion of imports.</p>
                    <p>This would not mean drastic reduction of our tariff except in a few cases. It
                        would not wholly abandon our traditional manner of tariff negotiation. It
                        would not abandon our “escape clause”.</p>
                    <p>Doubtless the program should also include contribution, through the Fund or
                        otherwise, to a stabilization fund.</p>
                    <p>To sum up, there seem to me to be two essential elements that will have to be
                        included in any U.S. program which will meet the need. The first is that it
                        have an element of unilateral contribution by the U.S. to the solution of
                        the great world trade imbalance. The second is that it be so drawn and so
                        adopted that it convinces other nations that our intention to accept more
                        imports is real and that whatever steps we do take will be lasting. It would
                        to my mind be better to take modest steps in such an atmosphere than to take
                        bigger steps which have a larger element of doubt as to their duration.</p>
                    <p>The unilateral element is very important because all these countries look at
                        the comparative size and power of the U.S. and at the tremendous imbalance
                        which has existed in dollar trade for so many years, and in the light of
                        this state of affairs the current approach of precisely balanced quid pro
                        quos seems to them futile.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Waugh</hi>: The conference is scheduled to end
                        today unless something unforeseen happens. I think it is fair to say we can
                        report “mission accomplished”.</p>
                    <p>It has been agreed that the life of the schedules will be prolonged for
                        another eighteen months. As far as we know New Zealand is the only country
                        whose signature to this declaration is doubtful. Thus the objective of
                        continued tariff stability during the period of review will have been
                        achieved.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese have been invited to participate in the work of the Contracting
                        Parties by the affirmative vote of 26 contracting parties. The abstentions
                        were the five Commonwealth countries, Czechoslovakia and Burma. After the
                        vote the Chairman asked the Japanese representative to take his seat at the
                        table, and it was quite a dramatic moment when Ambassador Matsumoto<note

                        middle of the room and walked, to a place which was then prepared for him at
                        the regular conference table. There was a sense that this small action
                        symbolized an event in history.</p>
                    <p>The signing of the Declaration committing governments to govern their
                        commercial relations with Japan by the provisions of the <gloss

                        will be more signatures to the Declaration because of the fact that we
                        persisted so long in holding to the one stage. This forced a number who were
                        waivering to take the decision to sign the Declaration which they might not
                        have made had they had the easier path open to them from the beginning.</p>
                    <p>The British application for a waiver under Article I reached a complete
                        deadlock until Wyndham White<note n="4" xml:id="d49fn4">Eric Wyndham White,
                            Executive Secretary of the General Agreement on Tariffs and

                        reached is to my mind far more satisfactory from our point of view than the
                        original proposal to which we were prepared to agree. It makes crystal clear
                        that the only thing the waiver does is to permit widening of preference
                        margins <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0193"/>where no diversion of trade
                        is likely to take place, and requires that the action taken be reversed if
                        it does in fact take place. It also gives the Contracting Parties a veto in
                        cases where they think that diversion will result.</p>
                    <p>This whole episode was very healthy because as it finally came out it
                        demonstrated that there is real opposition to increase of preference as a
                        matter of principle, and secondly because it showed that the smaller
                        countries are not just a rubber stamp for the actions of large ones in these
                        meetings, and given a good case about which they care they can exercise a
                        great influence.</p>
                    <p>On dairy products we achieved our main objectives of avoiding the issue of
                        the legality of our restrictions, avoiding general discussion of our
                        agricultural policy, and of minimizing retaliation against us. I am
                        convinced that the course we followed was right, and I hope that the
                        decisions taken here did not cause too much trouble for the Department with
                        Agriculture.</p>
                    <p>We were also able to exercise considerable influence in making the
                        consultations with the Schuman Plan<note n="5" xml:id="d49fn5">French
                            Foreign Minister Robert Schuman on May 9, 1950, proposed the placing of
                            French and German coal and steel under a common high authority. After
                            many weeks of negotiations which included other European nations, the
                            Schuman Plan evolved into the European Coal and Steel Community. For

                        into a real and substantive operation rather than a very formal and
                        legalistic discussion limited to the question of strict compliance with the
                        literal terms of the waiver. The Schuman Plan countries and the High
                        Authority, particularly the latter, had a very stand-offish attitude at
                        first, and even after the consultations were well under way and going
                        satisfactorily, it was only at the last moment that we persuaded them not to
                        request a paragraph in the Working Party report to the effect that next
                        year’s discussion on their report would be limited strictly to the terms of
                        the waiver. As it was, however, the whole thing went off very well, and I
                        think both sides are pleased.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the whole meeting ran the undercurrent of feeling which you
                        mentioned in your letter to the Secretary<note n="6" xml:id="d49fn6">Not
                            identified.</note> that the future of this and other efforts to
                        liberalize world trade depended essentially on the decisions of the United
                        States. After five weeks of working here, I am more impressed than ever by
                        the weight of the responsibility which rests upon us in making the decisions
                        as to our future foreign economic policy and the magnitude of the
                        opportunity which we have to influence the course of what actually happens.
                        Because, leaving aside the under-developed countries, whose role in the
                        matter is not as yet relatively very important, the <pb n="168"
                            xml:id="pg_168" facs="0194"/>others will come along with us if we
                        produce anything reasonably sensible.</p>
                    <p>In this connection you may be interested in copies of two letters I wrote
                        Linc Gordon in connection with the visit of the Randall Commission to
                            Paris.<note n="7" xml:id="d49fn7">One of the letters, dated Oct. 20,

                    <p>The Delegation performed with its customary competence. Two members, however,
                        need special mention. The first is Walter Hollis<note n="8" xml:id="d49fn8"
                            >Assistant to the Legal Adviser, Department of State.</note> who worked
                        indefatigably throughout the whole conference and was consulted by every
                        member of the Delegation on almost every issue which came up. His knowledge
                        and good judgment were completely invaluable. Moreover, he not only acted as
                        counsel to our Delegation but in effect as counsel to the Secretariat, and
                        spent a great deal of time with Wyndham White and Royer working out the
                        basic documents which the conference considered. I have had the most
                        appreciative comments from them about his work.</p>
                    <p>The other is Norwood.<note n="9" xml:id="d49fn9">Bernard Norwood, Office of
                            Economic Defense and Trade Policy, Department of State.</note> Not only
                        did he handle a working party which turned out to be much more difficult
                        than we expected it would be very competently, but he contributed sound good
                        judgment in the Delegation discussions on most other issues. Moreover, he
                        performed the indispensable function of keeping track of everything
                        substantive that was going on and seeing that we all did our work when it
                        had to be done. Finally, he has handled the whole matter of the records and
                        report, a job which it is so distasteful to do at the time and so invaluable
                        to have had well done when the next conference rolls around.</p>
                    <p>I would also like to express my appreciation for the complete support and
                        very prompt service which we received from the Department and the help that
                        other Embassies around the world gave us on the Japanese issue. It is very
                        good for a Delegation’s morale to have their telegrams promptly answered and
                        their judgment normally respected.</p>
                    <p>Peggy and I very much appreciated the note you wrote us from Beyrouth.
                        Getting to know you and Mrs. Waugh was one of the nicest things about what
                        has been for me a very worthwhile and rewarding five weeks. I am very
                        grateful to you for the opportunity to do this job.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Davis conducted the meeting and began by outlining once more
                        Agriculture’s program to offer surplus dairy products for export at world
                        market prices.<note n="3" xml:id="d51fn3">Representatives from the
                            Departments of State and Agriculture had met previously on Dec. 22, 1953
                            to discuss the surplus disposal issue. Several of the points listed in
                            this memorandum had been brought up at the earlier meeting (memorandum
                            of conversation, Dec. 22, 1953, 811.312/12–2253). Study of the problem
                            of agricultural surpluses was simultaneously undertaken in late 1953 and
                            early 1954 by the Cabinet Committee on Agricultural Surpluses created by
                            President Eisenhower to investigate the subject. This interdepartmental
                            group was headed by the Secretary of Agriculture and included
                            representatives from the State and Treasury Departments, the Bureau of
                            the Budget, the Foreign Operations Administration, and the White House.

                            <item>The fact that no offerings have been made for the past year is the
                                best evidence foreign countries could have of our consideration for
                                their welfare.</item>

                            <item>Agriculture must have some program to avoid Congressional
                                criticism. There was also the danger that Congress might seize the
                                initiative and pass mandatory legislation which would have serious
                                effects on other countries.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>There was really nothing new about this proposal, they merely
                                wanted to add dairy products to the present list of commodities
                                available for export.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Mr. Waugh said he did not see why the program was so urgent that a decision
                        had to be made almost immediately. He asked what advantage there would be in
                        view of the contention that the program would not move any substantial
                        quantities of the surplus. Mr. Gordon said any delay would render the
                        program futile. This was the low point in the production cycle in Western
                        Europe, and markets might be available now which would be unavailable later.
                        Some of the stocks on hand were a year old now and a year and a half was as
                        long as they could be held without serious deterioration. It was difficult
                        to rotate stocks as they were marked with brand names.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Raynor pointed out that a great deal of harm could be done to our
                        relationships with countries in Western Europe by any disposal program which
                        injured their trade. He stressed the importance of trade in dairy products
                        to the economies of these countries and the fact that the United States was
                        pressing for larger defense commitments and limitations on trade in
                        strategic items with the Soviet Bloc. The continued cooperation of these
                        countries was essential to the success of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>, and other
                        international undertakings important to the United States. He also mentioned
                        that Vice President Nixon on his return from the Far East had stressed the
                        serious political repercussions of what the United States did in the
                        economic field and urged that this be constantly kept in mind when we
                        considered specific actions affecting other countries.</p>

                    <p>Other representatives from State commented on various aspects of the proposed
                        program. The following were the principal points made: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The United States was not a significant exporter of butter and
                                cheese in the pre-war period, and it could not be claimed that we
                                were only trying to maintain our position in the markets. By
                                subsidizing sales of dairy products we would displace others from
                                their normal markets and face friendly countries with new
                                competition.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Markets for dairy products in Europe were limited and demand
                                already appeared satisfied. The market was so “thin” that the mere
                                announcement of the program might be enough to depress prices, as
                                buyers would be wary of any forward commitments.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>There is the danger, noted by all the affected countries as their
                                major concern, that if the surplus dairy products do not move at the
                                original offering prices, terrific pressure to lower the prices will
                                develop and may prove to be irresistible.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>In the discussion of sales prices, Mr. Davis several times said that the
                        offering prices would be at the median of the range. In previous meetings
                        Agriculture representatives including Mr. Davis had said they would be at or
                        near the top of the range.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Waugh suggested that all present “sleep” on the proposal over night, and
                        that if it could not be resolved between the two agencies that it be sent to
                        the White House for decision. Mr. Gordon pleaded for a prompt decision and
                        the meeting adjourned.</p>

                        I should like, however, to touch briefly on certain aspects of the session
                        which may be of special interest to you.</p>
                    <p>The session was one of a series of meetings which started in 1948 and which
                        now take place about once a year. The thirty-odd contracting parties met to
                        deal with trade matters arising out of the operation of the multilateral
                        trade agreement. General tariff negotiations were not a part of the business
                        of this session. The principal agenda subjects were: (a) the application of
                        Japan for provisional <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0198"/>accession to
                        the agreement, (b) the extension of the period during which the existing
                        tariff bindings would remain valid, that is, during which they would not be
                        subject to possible renegotiation under special procedures which were
                        scheduled to become operative at the beginning of this year, (c) a request
                        by the United Kingdom for a waiver from the agreement rule binding margins
                        of tariff preference in order to increase certain unbound tariff rates
                        against other parties without also raising the rates against Commonwealth
                        suppliers, and (d) the arrangements for a review of the agreement in 1954
                        for the purpose of seeing whether, and if so how, it might be revised,
                        including consideration of possible future tariff negotiations.</p>
                    <p>The main tasks of the United States Delegation were to prevent an unwinding
                        of trade commitments or impairment of the gains already achieved under the
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, to maintain a sense of momentum
                        and progress in the international work in the trade field, and at the same
                        time to avoid any action which would prejudice the examination of foreign
                        economic policy by the Randall Commission.</p>
                    <p>I believe that the Delegation was successful in these efforts. Other
                        countries were aware that the United States was re-examining its foreign
                        economic policy and were prepared to maintain the <hi rend="italic">status
                            quo</hi> until that examination was completed. As I wrote you from
                        Geneva, I and all the members of the Delegation were impressed by the
                        anxiety with which the other countries around the conference table were
                        awaiting the results of the Randall Commission study and the action which
                        the United States may take as a result, and the extent to which they were
                        withholding decisions as to what their own individual policies would be
                        until they knew these results.</p>
                    <p>The matter of Japanese accession, first requested by Japan in July, 1952, was
                        settled very satisfactorily from the United States point of view. As you
                        know, we have consistently and strongly supported this application. Most of
                        the other countries had been reluctant to have Japan come in except through
                        the normal process of a general tariff negotiation, which of course was out
                        of the question for the time being. It became apparent that although a
                        majority of the Contracting Parties now favored temporary Japanese
                        accession, even without tariff negotiations, we could not get the two-thirds
                        vote in favor of such accession which we believed was politically and
                        psychologically desirable. Therefore, with Japanese concurrence, we
                        developed and supported a two-stage proposal under which Japan would be
                        invited to participate without formal voting in the work of the Contracting
                        Parties until June 30, 1955, and Japan and individual Contracting Parties
                        could agree to apply the rules of the General Agreement to their trade
                        during this period of <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0199"/>temporary
                        participation. This two-stage arrangement was carried by a vote of 27 to
                        none, with the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Southern Rhodesia,
                        New Zealand, and Czechoslovakia abstaining. By the end of the year, 18
                        countries, including the United States, had signed the agreement to apply
                        the terms of the General Agreement to their trade with Japan.</p>
                    <p>The attitude of the United States Delegation caused great satisfaction to the
                        Japanese. In contrast, the British position vis-à-vis Japan was
                        significantly damaged, not only because of the substance of the position
                        they took, but because of the rather tactless way in which they handled it.
                        I believe that the British position resulted largely from pressure put on
                        the Government by the Lancashire textile industry which is fearful of
                        Japanese competition in third countries and from a general public
                        apprehension in the United Kingdom of cut-throat Japanese competition, of
                        which there has been some experience in the past.</p>
                    <p>Australia’s objections were principally political. There is great public
                        feeling against Japan in Australia. The Government felt that it had made a
                        number of moves recently toward improving its relations with Japan and did
                        not believe that public opinion would sustain it in taking this additional
                        step so soon.</p>
                    <p>It was a matter of satisfaction to the United States Delegation that the
                        meeting agreed to extension of the firm validity of the tariff concessions
                        under the agreement for a further period of 18 months, that is, until June
                        30, 1955, and that this was accomplished without any reservations. We were
                        anxious to have this period extended in order to prevent a possible
                        substantial unwinding of tariff concessions negotiated under the
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>One of the most important decisions of the meeting was that in which the
                        Contracting Parties granted a limited waiver to the United Kingdom from the
                        rule which prevents the increase of margins of tariff preference from the
                        level existing in 1947. This was perhaps the most controversial issue in the
                        meeting and was not settled until the very last moment. The outcome was
                        satisfactory to the United States. A solution was found to a very real and
                        extremely difficult problem without doing violence to the principle that
                        tariff preferences should not be increased. Furthermore, a solution was
                        found despite the opposition by the Continental countries as a bloc to the
                        British request. This opposition was significant in demonstrating that
                        opposition to tariff preferences was not an aberration peculiar to the
                        United States, a view heretofore held by the British. The effective
                        resistance of the Continental countries, led by Denmark, also demonstrated
                        the value of the agreement to relatively small countries which have occasion
                        to defend their trade interests from the action of stronger powers.</p>
                    <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0200"/>
                    <p>During the course of the meeting a series of specific trade disputes brought
                        before the Contracting Parties were either settled or moved forward on the
                        road to settlement. The meeting thus again demonstrated the value of the
                        agreement as a means of orderly settlement of international trade disputes
                        and as a forum for discussing problems which might otherwise create
                        difficulties between the Contracting Parties.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the meeting set the stage for potentially important action in the
                        field of international trade in the near future. This arises from the fact
                        that arrangements were made for reviewing the General Agreement in October
                        1954.</p>
                    <p>It became evident at the beginning of the session that there was practically
                        unanimous sentiment that, although the agreement had been generally useful
                        and effective, it had been in effect for six years in a changing world and
                        the time had come to take a hard look at operations under the agreement and
                        also at the terms of the agreement itself to see what revisions and
                        improvements were desirable and necessary.</p>
                    <p>Since the General Agreement is the only international agreement in the trade
                        field, this means that next October or a few months thereafter there will be
                        a large scale international review of international trade policy rules and
                        practices. The task in that review will be to preserve and strengthen the
                        progress already made and to see what improvements can be introduced. United
                        States policies resulting from the Randall Commission report will be a major
                        factor determining the results of this review.</p>
                    <p>To confine this review to what will be feasible and profitable will not be
                        easy. There will be many efforts, particularly on the part of underdeveloped
                        countries, for the loosening of some of the basic rules to which the United
                        States attaches importance and for the expansion of the coverage of the
                        agreement, not only into fairly closely related fields such as commodity
                        agreements and restrictive business practices, but into more unrelated areas
                        of full employment and economic development. The main task of the United
                        States in preparing for this review is going to be to see that we have
                        positive and constructive proposals to make, around which support can be
                        mobilized, not only because of their essential desirability but in order to
                        counteract more extreme ideas.</p>

                        <p>2. The U.S. Government, under its price-support programs for agricultural
                            products, has accumulated burdensome surpluses of certain farm products.
                            The present disposal program offers little prospect for reducing
                            substantially the size of these stocks either by disposals in the United
                            States or by exports to free world countries. In view of prospective
                            losses from deterioration, and confronted with recent export license
                            applications to ship some of these Government-owned surplus stocks to
                            the Soviet Bloc, it becomes important to examine whether such exports
                            present problems from the viewpoint of our economic defense policy and
                            other interests.</p>
                        <p>3. The problem posed by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning
                            Board requires consideration of the following major questions: (a) What
                            are the “perishable” Government-owned surplus agricultural products and
                            the problems presented by their disposal to the Soviet Bloc? (b) What
                            are the “non-perishable” materials which are probably obtainable from
                            the Soviet Bloc and are needed by the United States? and (c) What are
                            the advantages and disadvantages of resort to barter as a means of
                            disposal of these surpluses?</p>
                        <p>4. In order to place the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> problem in
                            proper perspective, it is necessary to examine the problems involved in
                            export sales to the Soviet Bloc of such surpluses for dollars or
                            gold.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">iii. summary of principal
                                findings</hi></p>
                        <p>5. Dairy products (butter, dried milk and cheese) are the principal
                            “perishables” among the Government-owned surplus stocks of farm
                            products. On February 24 these dairy stocks were valued at $393 million,
                            with butter representing $191 million or 284 million <pb n="178"
                                xml:id="pg_178" facs="0204"/>pounds. However, not all these stocks
                            require urgent disposal at this time.</p>
                        <p>6. Exports to the Soviet Bloc may enable the avoidance of some loss which
                            would arise from deterioration of Government-owned perishables which do
                            not appear to be disposable in a better way under the current
                            program.</p>
                        <p>7. Opportunities for disposal by way of barter in exchange for Bloc
                            non-perishables are quite limited since (a) the U.S. need for any
                            materials is not great enough to justify special concessions to get them
                            from the Soviet Bloc; (b) the list of durable materials from the Bloc
                            which the U.S. could use advantageously is extremely limited, and of
                            these only platinum is believed to be available for export from the
                            Bloc; (c) the acquisition of materials other than those on this list,
                            such as manganese, is not considered feasible at this time.</p>
                        <p>8. Barter, especially between Governments, is contrary to U.S. commercial
                            policy interest generally, and should not be encouraged except in
                            unusual circumstances.</p>
                        <p>9. Disposal of perishable surpluses to the Soviet Bloc for dollars or
                            gold should be given serious consideration because: (a) More perishables
                            may be disposed of in this manner than where durable goods are required
                            in exchange; and (b) cash transactions through private trade channels
                            are the most effective methods of carrying on international trade and
                            are consistent with U.S. policy and practice.</p>
                        <p>10. The main difficulties involved in proposed exports of
                            Government-owned perishable surplus stocks of farm products to the
                            Soviet Bloc, whether for dollars, gold, or durable goods, are: (a)
                            Subsidization in terms of the relationship of the export price to
                            Government support level and world price, (b) adverse public reaction,
                            and (c) possible adverse effects on friendly countries which rely on
                            trade in such commodities with the Bloc.</p>
                        <p>11. The most troublesome of these is adverse public reaction which is
                            related to the subsidization aspect. This problem is particularly
                            difficult in the case of butter because of the public consciousness of
                            the problem. Nevertheless, barter would not avoid the necessity of
                            facing up to these problems, nor would it successfully mask the true
                            prices for the commodities involved.</p>
                        <p>12. The sale of perishables to the Soviet Bloc would dispose of only a
                            small part of the U.S. Government-owned surplus and a number of
                            difficulties are involved in such transactions. If, in spite of these
                            considerations, disposal of some of the agricultural surplus commodities
                            is deemed of sufficient importance, it is concluded that:</p>
                        <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0205"/>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">iv. conclusions</hi></p>
                        <p>13. The Government should be prepared to consider proposals received
                            directly from the Soviets, through private trade channels or through
                            other governments, which would result in the disposal of surplus farm
                            perishables to the Soviet Bloc in return for dollars, gold, or the
                            commodities on the list of acceptable materials.</p>
                        <p>14. The desirability of any particular transaction can only be determined
                            after a careful study of the pertinent facts.</p>

                        <p>16. Since 1938 U.S. exports to the Soviet Bloc, except under lend-lease
                            during the war and as a result of the current embargo on strategic
                            goods, have consisted predominantly of machinery and vehicles.
                            Perishable commodities have never figured significantly in U.S.
                            commercial exports to the U.S.S.R., but Poland and some of the Eastern
                            European countries have, from time to time, been fairly significant
                            importers from the U.S. of cheaper grades of edible fats, such as
                            lard.</p>
                        <p>17. As shown by attached Table III for the years 1938 and 1947, the only
                            non-perishable items generally entering into U.S. imports from the
                            U.S.S.R. are chrome and manganese ore and platinum-type metals. No
                            non-perishable materials of significance have been imported into the
                            U.S. in the past from Soviet Bloc countries other than the U.S.S.R. Furs
                            have generally accounted for about 50% by value of U.S. imports from the
                            U.S.S.R.</p>
                        <p>18. During 1953 principal U.S. exports to the Bloc comprised tobacco,
                            cigarettes, wool rags, and hops. Principal U.S. imports from the Bloc
                            were hams and bacon, furs, fertilizer, crude feathers, photographic
                            goods, bristles, and palladium.</p>
                        <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0206"/>
                        <p>19. In general, U.S. policy permits the approval of exports to the Soviet
                            Bloc in Europe of commodities which are not strategic and not in
                            domestic short supply. The perishable agricultural products dealt with
                            in this paper fall in this category.</p>
                        <p>20. In general, U.S. import policy does not impose any special
                            restrictions on imports from the Soviet Bloc other than Communist China,
                            except for certain goods produced by slave labor.</p>
                        <p>21. Dairy products (butter, dried milk and cheese) are the principal
                            perishable items, i.e., would suffer comparatively rapid deterioration.
                            As of February 24, the total cost to the Government of these dairy
                            products held by CCC was $393,127,000. Butter represented $190,589,000
                            or 283,699,000 pounds. Not all dairy products’ stocks represent an
                            urgent disposal problem at this time since only a portion is in danger
                            of early deterioration. There may be, from time to time, marginal
                            quantities of other agricultural products held by the Government which
                            are in danger of spoilage and, therefore, should be considered
                            perishable. Practically all the stocks held by CCC, now inventoried at

                            rotation, scarcity of adequate storage facilities, cost of upkeep,
                            emergencies, etc. It is not possible at this time to estimate accurately
                            the size of the “disposal” problem arising from prospective economic
                            loss through deterioration, but it involves many millions of
                            dollars.</p>
                        <p>22. Of the Government-owned farm products, the Bloc countries have shown
                            the greatest interest in butter and cottonseed oil. They also appear
                            interested in linseed oil, tallow, wheat, tobacco, lard, grease and pure
                            cellulose.</p>
                        <p>23. The extent of the Bloc’s real need for or intent to purchase these
                            materials is not known. However, it is generally accepted that per
                            capita consumption of fats and oils in the Soviet Bloc is low and the
                            Bloc could absorb large quantities of these commodities.</p>
                        <p>24. In 1953, the Soviet Union bought more than its customary quantities
                            of edible fats from other countries. Exports of dairy products by free
                            world countries (Denmark, Netherlands and Sweden) totalled 32.1 million
                            pounds worth $15 million in 1952, and 13.8 million pounds worth $7
                            million in the first half of 1953. Recent Bloc contracts for butter from
                            free world sources involved 91.3 million pounds. (See attached Tables I
                            and II.) It is not known whether the Soviet Union would continue this
                            scale of procurement and buy from the United States in addition thereto
                            or whether the U.S.S.R. would take American perishables in lieu of
                            customary purchases from other sources.</p>
                        <p>25. U.S. exports of certain of these farm products might have adverse
                            economic and political impact on those countries which carried <pb
                                n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0207"/>on export trade in such
                            commodities. From the viewpoint of impact on friendly countries and
                            consistency with U.S. commercial trade policy, such exports would be
                            desirable if they did not contain elements of subsidy or, if they were
                            subsidized, provided they did not impinge on normal commercial markets.
                            These problems would arise particularly if the export price is less than
                            the support level or the world price. Where such problems exist, prior
                            consultation with the friendly governments concerned would be
                            desirable.</p>
                        <p>26. From the viewpoint of adverse public reactions, at home and abroad,
                            which might arise from such exports, extremely difficult estimates are
                            required, which, in the ultimate analysis, can properly be made only at
                            the Cabinet level.</p>
                        <p>27. From the viewpoint of national security, approval of some exports to
                            the Soviet Bloc of Government-owned perishable surplus farm products
                            would not raise any significant security problems. The proposed export
                            of 5000 long tons of tallow worth $784,000 to Poland, which was approved
                            in September 1953 by the Department of Commerce, is illustrative of the
                            general line of approved exports to the Soviet Bloc involving open
                            market items which are not strategic and not in short supply. Other
                            security considerations are: <list>

                                    of fats and oils in the West have probably drained off most of

                        <p>30. Of the above materials, only platinum is known to be available from
                            the Bloc. The U.S. stockpile is now 200,000 ounces (valued at about $18.
                            million) short of its goal for platinum, much of which might be procured
                            from the Bloc without adverse effect on free-world producers. It is not
                            known whether the Bloc would be willing to supply any of the other
                            materials listed above.</p>
                        <p>31. Manganese and chrome are not on the above list despite the fact that
                            they are known to be available from the Bloc. The U.S. stockpile goals
                            for these materials are now within reach of full achievement through
                            supplies under contract with non-Soviet sources. Some of these sources
                            were developed to replace Soviet Bloc supplies.</p>
                        <p>32. Other materials, including manganese and chrome ore, are currently
                            being offered by the Bloc in trade agreements with Western countries.
                            However, their acquisition by the U.S. Government at this time is not
                            considered feasible. U.S. and free world markets cannot now absorb these
                            materials without probable serious harm to producers in the U.S. and in
                            friendly countries, and therefore such acquisition should be
                            contemplated only if an adequate means for holding such materials off
                            the market under appropriate safeguards is available. The strategic
                            stockpile cannot be considered for this purpose unless the procurement
                            program is expanded, which requires the establishment of new goals and
                            securing additional appropriatons for procurement of any magnitude.
                            Insulation of these acquisitions under authority other than the
                            stockpile involves complex problems of policy. Moreover, the potentially
                            depressing effect of such acquisitions on future production in the free
                            world cannot be dismissed, even if such problems are solved.</p>

                                <item>Barter would not successfully mask the true prices of the
                                    surplus commodities and the durable materials involved. If the
                                    transaction in effect involved a subsidized price for the
                                    perishables, whether in terms of the quantity of perishables
                                    given for the durables received or in the price at which these
                                    durables were subsequently disposed, the subsidy would be just
                                    as apparent to critics of such a transaction as would a straight
                                    sale at reduced prices.</item>

                        <p>36. From a practical viewpoint, barter would make only a minor
                            contribution to the solution of the problem of disposing of U.S.
                            Government surpluses.</p>
                        <p>37. The desirability of any particular transaction can only be determined
                            after a careful study of the facts pertinent to each case.</p>
                        <p>38. Substitution of non-perishable for perishable commodities may, in
                            many instances, merely change the complexion of our problems. Unless the
                            durables are readily consumed in the open market or retained in
                            Government stocks under appropriate safeguards, the adverse economic
                            impact would be transferred from agriculture to another segment of the
                            business community. Examples of possible economic impact are:
                            Competition with production in the U.S. or free world, depressing effect
                            on prices, and interference with private trade.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">viii. evaluation of sales to soviet
                                bloc for dollars or gold</hi></p>
                        <p>39. Early in February, the Government announced that “it had been decided
                            as a matter of policy to deny commercial export license applications for
                            the export for cash of United States Government-owned surplus
                            agricultural or vegetable fiber products to Russia or her satellites.”
                            It was further stated that “this ban does not preclude study of export
                            license applications for these non-strategic products to the Soviet Bloc
                            if acquired by exporters in the open market and not from the Commodity
                            Credit Corporation surplus stocks.”</p>
                        <p>40. Nevertheless and inasmuch as barter appears to afford only minor
                            benefits within a limited scope of trade opportunities and has other
                            peculiar limitations, it is deemed appropriate to re-examine the problem
                            of such exports for dollars or gold.</p>
                        <p>41. Cash transactions through private trade channels are traditional,
                            normal and consistent with U.S. international trade policy and
                            practice.</p>
                        <p>42. Our receipt of some dollars and gold from the Soviets might be
                            considered tantamount to a reduction of a strategic resource to the
                            Soviet Bloc, and would enable us to know the use to which the Soviets
                            have put these dollars and gold.</p>
                        <p>43. From a practical business viewpoint, exports of such surplus products
                            for cash would enable the Government to get rid of some products which
                            might otherwise deteriorate. Some of the taxpayers’ money could be
                            saved. The dollars or gold received in payment might be used, directly
                            or indirectly, to purchase needed materials from friendly countries, or
                            to purchase on a selective basis from the Soviet Bloc such
                            non-perishables as we may desire, without the necessity of developing
                            involved barter transactions and in a manner more consistent with U.S.
                            commercial policy and practice.</p>
                        <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0211"/>
                        <p>44. Cash transactions are not limited in scope and flexibility as are
                            barter transactions, and may enable the disposal of the Soviet Bloc of
                            greater quantities of perishable surpluses.</p>
                        <p>45. The element of subsidization which gives rise to adverse public
                            reaction is more apparent in a cash transaction.</p>
                        <p>46. There may be other pertinent aspects of receipts of cash or gold of
                            particular concern to the Treasury Department, which are not considered
                            in this paper.</p>
                        <p>47. On balance, and depending on the circumstances and facts relevant to
                            each particular transaction which must be reviewed on their merits, some
                            exports for dollars or gold of some Government-owned surplus perishable
                            agricultural products to the Soviet Bloc might be defensible.</p>

                                        commodities, that this trade will help in some degree to
                                        alleviate the hard lot of the masses of the people under the
                                        Soviet yoke. This is the first occasion on which the
                                        Communist rulers have shown any willingness to engage in
                                        such trade, and they are evidently forced to do so now
                                        because of the increasing restiveness of the peoples under
                                        Communist oppression and the obvious failure of their own
                                        collectivized agriculture. The willingness of the U.S. to
                                        engage in this trade does not affect the U.S. determination
                                        not to engage in trade in such materials as would add to the
                                        military power of the Communist regime and thus further
                                        their aggressive aims.</item>

                            <item>U.S. propaganda would be under some handicaps in asserting that
                                the U.S. action had been mainly inspired by humanitarian concern for
                                the welfare of the people in Communist countries. That fact that the
                                U.S. is plagued by a problem of chronic agricultural surplus must be
                                assumed to be fairly widely known. Moreover, the humanitarian motive
                                would be discredited by statements made in this country that the
                                transactions had been undertaken because <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189"

                                concerned, no clear and decisive advantage. We believe that the
                                propaganda battle would produce mixed reactions among the Satellite
                                and Soviet peoples and would be at best a stand-off.</item>

                                acceptance of the Communist regimes. Nor do we believe it would be
                                so substantial as to sharpen discontent, on the theory that
                                improvements in desperate material conditions would lead to
                                aggressive demands for additional gains.</item>

                            <item>It is possible that such a departure in U.S. trade policy might be
                                regarded by some among the Satellite peoples as a step toward
                                normalizing relations between the U.S. and the USSR. A normalization
                                of relations might carry the implication that there had been an
                                acceptance by the U.S. of the status quo in Eastern Europe. The
                                result might therefore be to discourage hopes for early liberation
                                from Communist control and consequently to weaken the will to
                                resistance.</item>

                                discussion of the consequences of the proposed barter transactions
                                has assumed that these would be negotiated secretly and announced
                                publicly only when agreement had been reached. In a public
                                negotiation, the U.S. could probably gain some net propaganda
                                advantage by initiating proposals for such transactions. On the
                                other hand, if the USSR initiated the proposals, we believe that the
                                U.S. would not derive much advantage from accepting them, and would
                                probably suffer some disadvantage from refusing them.</item>

                            >CIA</gloss> had a number of amendments to propose. The first one, in
                        paragraph 2, was designed to correct the impression given by the existing
                        paragraph that the draft report had not considered political and domestic
                        issues but had confined itself to the national security interest involved in
                        the disposal abroad of Government-owned agricultural surpluses. In point of
                        fact, the economic and political considerations had been considered, and
                        this fact should therefore be stated.</p>
                    <p>After discussion of this and other amendments proposed by <gloss
                            target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, Secretary Humphrey expressed the belief
                        that it would be desirable to trade our surplus butter for almost anything
                        we could get in return from the Soviet bloc. He did not agree that we should
                        confine our trade of butter only to the receipt of urgently needed
                        materials. The President endorsed Secretary Humphrey’s point of view by
                        stating that it would be advantageous to the United States at all times to
                        get non-perishable materials in exchange for surplus perishables. The
                        President went on to state that this would apply to materials in the
                        stockpile even in the event that stockpile objectives had already been
                        reached. Secretary Dulles and Dr. Flemming also expressed agreement with
                        Secretary Humphrey’s view.</p>
                    <p>It was accordingly suggested that paragraph 5-a-(1) should be amended to
                        indicate that we would dispose of Government-owned <pb n="191"
                            xml:id="pg_191" facs="0217"/>surpluses to the USSR in return for any
                        strategic materials and not only for those most urgently needed.</p>
                    <p>The President then expressed the view that, since the present paper at its
                        outset stated the general rule that disposal abroad of Government-owned
                        agricultural surpluses should be decided on a case-by-case basis, he thought
                        it foolish to vitiate this general rule by a series of specific guidelines
                        set forth in the subsequent paragraphs of the paper.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cutler explained to the President that it was essential, before bartering
                        agricultural surpluses with the Soviet bloc, to make sure that such barter
                        did not seriously injure the trade of friendly countries. The President
                        replied that since the materials we received from the Soviet Union would go
                        into our stockpiles, they would be insulated and would consequently do no
                        harm to the trade of our allies. Mr. Cutler then pointed out to the
                        President that the damage might work the other way round, and that if we
                        dumped agricultural surpluses on the Soviet bloc this would deprive some of
                        our allies of their market for these products in the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Dulles, using manganese as an illustration, stated that he had
                        assumed that if the United States got non-perishable materials from the
                        Soviet bloc they would promptly be placed in the stockpile. Accordingly, the
                        exchange would not interfere with normal U.S. purchases of manganese from
                        friendly countries.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that the sensible thing to do was to raise stockpile
                        objectives. We would lose our friends and allies damned fast if we took our
                        butter out into the Atlantic and sank it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Francis suggested that the Council not concern itself unduly about
                        surplus butter, since he believed that he had devised a program which would
                        ensure getting rid of the butter without resort to barter proceedings with
                        foreign countries.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Burns stated his belief that the Planning Board paper had made a valid,
                        if somewhat subtle, distinction between urgently needed strategic materials
                        and other materials which it would be merely desirable for the United States
                        to obtain in exchange for perishables. He likewise endorsed the caution
                        contained in the paper with respect to possible damage to the trade of
                        friendly countries.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Humphrey, however, reiterated his earlier opinion that he would
                        take anything, even including soft currencies, if we could get rid of
                        perishable agricultural surpluses in the United States. The President
                        likewise emphasized his conviction that the United States could not afford
                        to destroy food under any circumstances.</p>
                    <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0218"/>
                    <p>Secretary Humphrey said that he could not imagine the United States selling
                        butter to the Soviet Union at any price lower than American housewives were
                        obliged to pay for this commodity.</p>
                    <p>After further discussion, Mr. Francis said that he very much wished to “get
                        into the act”. He pointed out that it was possible to distinguish between
                        various types of perishable agricultural surpluses. Butter was in a rather
                        special category, and he hoped that a plan to sell our surplus butter back
                        to the U.S. people would be successful. He did not believe that if
                        cottonseed oil, for example, were bartered or sold to the Soviet bloc at
                        less than the domestic price, it would cause any great difficulty. The real
                        trouble, said Mr. Francis, was that we were not in a position to sell any of
                        these surplus commodities at the world price, although the law permitted
                        such a sale even though the world price was lower than the domestic price.
                        In point of fact, barriers to such transactions existed among the
                        departments and agencies, chiefly on the ground of the injury such
                        transactions might do to the economies of our allies.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired who was preventing Mr. Francis from making these sales
                        of surplus agricultural products, and Mr. Francis replied that it was
                        primarily the State Department.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cutler pointed out that the Planning Board paper had advised against the
                        sale of these products at less than world prices since we were anxious not
                        to depress the world market for these surplus products.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Dulles, in turn, defended the State Department point of view by
                        indicating that it was impossible for the United States to hold its
                        coalition together if all our specific actions tended to disrupt the
                        alliance. Nothing that the United States could do to finish off the alliance
                        would be more effective than if it proceeded to indiscriminate dumping of
                        its surplus agricultural commodities. Obviously, therefore, the Planning
                        Board had been right to draw attention to the importance of avoiding damage
                        to the trade of our allies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Francis stated his agreement with the point of view expressed by
                        Secretary Dulles and by the Planning Board draft, but indicated his
                        conviction that officials of the several Government departments were not
                        following the general guidance suggested by Secretary Dulles, and had been
                        too cautious in reaching decisons regarding disposal of agricultural
                        surpluses.</p>
                    <p>Governor Stassen said that the Commodity Credit Corporation was more
                        responsible than the State Department for the failure to move any
                        significant amounts of surplus agricultural commodities, because the CCC
                        insisted on getting what they had paid from all those to whom they proposed
                        to sell the commodities. Governor Stassen also endorsed Secretary Dulles’
                        position that such transactions <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0219"
                        />should not be permitted to disturb normal market price. While, he said, we
                        should exchange these commodities at the world price to friendly countries,
                        even though the world price were lower than the U.S. domestic price, we
                        should not do this in the case of sales to the Soviet bloc. Sales to the
                        bloc should be no lower than the domestic price.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Humphrey agreed with Governor Stassen that the sale of surplus
                        agricultural commodities to the Soviets at a lower than U.S. domestic price
                        would create an impossible situation with public opinion.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Morse stated that he thought that the “case-by-case” basis offered
                        a sufficient guide in the disposal of agricultural surpluses. While he
                        agreed with Secretary Humphrey that we could not exchange butter with the
                        Russians at a lower price than the U.S. domestic price, he saw no reason why
                        we could not sell them cottonseed oil at less than the domestic price.</p>
                    <p>After further discussion of desirable revision of paragraph 5-a, Mr. Cutler
                        suggested that the problem be left to the individual who had to administer
                        the program for disposing of perishable agricultural commodities, with
                        discretion to make a decision on a case-by-case basis. Secretary Wilson
                        endorsed this view, and stated that he would be perfectly willing to see the
                        administrator make a few mistakes if he could actually get rid of some of
                        these surplus materials. The President was sure that Secretary Wilson had
                        made a good point.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cutler then invited the Council’s attention to a proposed revision by
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> of paragraph 5-b, which stated that
                        “The receipt by the Soviet and European satellite peoples of U.S.
                        agricultural surpluses in amounts which are small compared to Soviet bloc
                        production would, in itself, involve no clear security advantage or
                        disadvantage to the United States.” General Cabell explained that while
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> agreed to the general reasoning
                        behind this paragraph, he did not agree that there would be no security
                        disadvantage if the United States bartered even small amounts of certain
                        agricultural commodities which have been publicized by the Soviets in recent
                        weeks as in seriously short supply in the Soviet Union. The President said
                        that as he understood General Cabell, the latter did not wish us to assist
                        the Soviet Union to achieve the success of a Five-Year Plan to overcome
                        deficits in the food supply.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cutler explained why the Planning Board had taken its position, and added
                        that if the Council adopted General Cabell’s suggested amendment the result
                        in all probability would be that no agricultural surpluses could be
                        exchanged by the United States with Soviet bloc countries.</p>
                    <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0220"/>
                    <p>Secretary Dulles expressed the opinion that the proposed <gloss
                            target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> revision raised a very basic policy issue.
                        The economic plight of the consumer in the Soviet bloc countries was
                        obviously very bad, and there was widespread distress which posed serious
                        problems for the governments, especially in the satellite states. Two
                        different theories were current in the free world with regard to the free
                        world reaction to this situation. One view, endorsed by Sir Winston
                        Churchill, insisted that the interests of peace would be advanced if the
                        free world shipped commodities to the Soviet bloc which would ease the
                        distress of the consumer and make him more content with his fate. The other
                        view held that the interests of peace were more likely to be advanced if the
                        Soviet rulers were increasingly forced to concern themselves with internal
                        problems; they would be so preoccupied with such problems that they would
                        have no time for external adventures. The Planning Board paper, said
                        Secretary Dulles, looking at this issue, had reached the opinion that the
                        amounts of agricultural commodities which we could send to the Soviet Union
                        were so small as to have no effect one way or the other on the main
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>It was pointed out that even if we disposed of all our surplus butter to the
                        Soviet Union this would only mean one and a half pounds for each Soviet
                        citizen—not enough either to cause a revolution or to make the Soviet
                        citizen more content with his lot.</p>
                    <p>The President disagreed, and expressed the belief that a pound and a half of
                        butter to each Soviet citizen could have a significant effect. History
                        indicated that revolutions rarely arose in societies which were completely
                        ground down by poverty and hunger. It was when they got a taste of the
                        better things of life that their discontent with their lot flamed into
                        revolt.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Wilson said that he still did not understand paragraph 5-b, and
                        wished that it be deleted.</p>
                    <p>The discussion then shifted to paragraph 5-a-(3), which stated that there
                        would be a security advantage to the United States in receiving dollars from
                        the Soviet bloc in exchange for agricultural surpluses so long as such
                        exchange did not result in material injury to the trade of friendly
                        countries. Secretary Humphrey expressed his disapproval of this paragraph,
                        and suggested that exchanges with the Soviet Union should be by barter only
                        and not in terms of dollars.</p>
                    <p>After further discussion, Mr. Cutler said that as he understood it, the
                        Council desired to revise this paragraph to indicate that if the United
                        States engaged in anything other than barter transactions with the Soviet
                        Union, there must be a very clear and definite advantage to the United
                        States.</p>
                    <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0221"/>
                    <p>The President predicted that we would have to shut our eyes to a lot of leaks
                        of materials from our allies to the Soviet bloc if we were to keep most of
                        these nations as allies. This applied to all phases of East-West trade. He
                        accordingly again recommended the case-by-case basis for decision, and
                        pointed out the futility of insisting to our allies that they decline to
                        trade with the Soviet Union and at the same time insisting that they cannot
                        trade with the United States.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Flemming inquired whether the President desired him to formulate a new
                        policy statement which would raise stockpile requirements to enable us to
                        take more non-perishable materials in return for perishables. He pointed out
                        that the use of stockpile funds would ease the financial problem of the
                        Commodity Credit Corporation, and that the insulation of the commodities in
                        the stockpile would cause no undue repercussions on world prices. The
                        President replied that of course this was the common sense thing to do.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Dulles then raised the specific problem of a Brazilian request for
                        U.S. wheat. Since Brazil had played a key role in helping the United States
                        at Caracas, should we not give the Brazilians the wheat they needed in
                        exchange for materials which we might not need very much? At least this
                        would get rid of our wheat and help a good friend. The President replied
                        that if the transaction did not place obstacles in Canada’s path it should
                        be done by all means.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Francis stated that he was very encouraged at the direction which the
                        Council discussion of the problem had taken, but he hoped that the members
                        of the Council would explain to the officials of their departments the views
                        which they had supported at the meeting. Mr. Francis also endorsed General
                        Cabell’s suggested revision of paragraph 5-b so as to avoid any substantial
                        contribution by the United States to fulfillment of Soviet bloc food
                        programs. It was accordingly agreed to accept General Cabell’s revision of
                        paragraph 5-b.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Francis then raised the question of what purpose was served by paragraph
                        3 of the report, which pointed out that “trading on a
                        government-to-government basis is a departure from private enterprise
                        theory, is inconsistent with U.S. commercial policy and practice, and is
                        warranted only where there are overriding advantages.” Mr. Francis
                        questioned whether the issues raised by this paragraph bore any relation to
                        national security considerations, and he felt that it was better for the
                        paper to confine itself to these considerations. Although Mr. Cutler
                        explained why the Planning Board had felt it important to include this
                        paragraph, it was the general view of the Council that it should be
                        stricken.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Your Department has invited
                        comments from this Department regarding your plan to sell feed grains for
                        export at world market prices. This plan, we are told, would provide for a
                        new policy of export subsidies for feed grains and weekly readjustments of
                        the prices at which these grains would be offered for export sale.</p>
                    <p>The State Department fears that an export program of this type would force
                        world prices down unduly and would have serious harmful effects on the
                        economies of other countries. Weekly readjustments in offering prices and in
                        subsidies, which would be expected and awaited by buyers, would have a
                        depressing effect upon prices and would result in the United States
                        following prices progressively downward. Prices could not rise at any time
                        since the United States would stand ready to sell large quantities at
                        prevailing prices. Except in so far as other governments took steps to
                        withhold supplies from the market, the ultimate effect of this policy would
                        be to force prices down to very low levels.</p>
                    <p>I am aware that support prices in the United States resulted in the loss of
                        export markets for a number of our agricultural products. I do not wish to
                        object to the sale of these products at prices below domestic price levels.
                        The point I wish to stress, however, with respect to the feed grain plan is
                        that an announcement of a continuing policy to make periodic readjustments
                        of prices, and without an evaluation of the effects of the initial downward
                        adjustment, would doubtless create a grave and justified concern among other
                        friendly countries.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, I believe it is important to bear in mind that the question of
                        disposing abroad of government-owned agricultural surpluses was considered
                        of sufficient consequence to be considered by the National Security Council
                        early in April. In this consideration of the security aspects of disposing
                        of agricultural supplies, you will recall that a general caveat was entered
                        to the effect that disposal operations should be carried on in such a manner
                        that “no material injury is done to the trade of friendly countries”. This
                        in effect reaffirmed Administration policy on this matter, enunciated, for
                        instance, in the communiqué issued after the first meeting of the <pb
                            n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0224"/>Joint United States-Canadian
                        Committee on Trade and Economic Affairs. Beyond that, the same concept has
                        been affirmed by the Congress in the safeguards contained in the authority
                        given the Executive in Section 550 of the mutual security legislation.<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d55fn2">Section 550 of the Mutual Security Act of 1953
                            (Public Law 116), enacted July 16, 1953, provided that not less than
                            $100 million nor more than $250 million of the funds appropriated under
                            the Act were to be used to finance the purchase of surplus agricultural
                            commodities by friendly countries; for text, see 67 Stat.
                        1520.</note></p>
                    <p>Extraordinary care must be taken to minimize the ill effects of our special
                        measures on world prices and the usual marketings of other countries. Damage
                        to the economies of these countries must be avoided when this would be
                        contrary to the security interest of the United States. In analyzing the
                        effects of our actions on the economies of other countries consultation is
                        essential. This takes a certain amount of time, and so I hope the Department
                        of State will be notified well in advance concerning any special disposal
                        measures which your Department is contemplating. In the case of reduced
                        prices on cheese and dried milk which were announced recently, the
                        Department requested advance notification of only four working days in order
                        that it might advise other countries of the proposed export price
                        announcement. This short advance notice was adequate in this case only
                        because discussions with interested governments regarding these products had
                        occurred at an earlier date. Ordinarily, however, a substantially longer
                        period of time than four days is essential if consultation is to be
                        meaningful.</p>
                    <p>I realize that it is difficult for your Department to devise export programs
                        which are effective and which will not, at the same time, have serious
                        effects on our foreign relations. Members of the Department of State will be
                        glad to discuss promptly with representatives of your Department the feed
                        grains problem which I have mentioned and any other special disposal
                        measures which your Department may devise, in an effort to reach an agreed
                        solution of these important problems.</p>
                    <p>I am sending copies of this letter to Mr. Francis and Dr. Hauge.<note n="3"

                            apparent that the President has asked you to see Mr. Reed in order that
                            you can emphasize the political and security consequences of a failure
                            to get an extension with authority. There should be no reason to be
                            drawn, therefore, into a discussion of the economic details of the trade
                            program.</item>

                        before you as forcefully as I can.</p>
                    <p>The Department does not contest the basic finding of the Commission that
                        there is serious distress among marginal lead and zinc mines as a result of
                        the sharp decline in prices since the peak reached during the Korean war. We
                        do not agree however that any substantial part of that distress can be
                        attributed to the reductions that have been made in the tariffs on lead and
                        zinc under the Trade Agreements program nor that the increase in duties
                        recommended by the Commission would serve to solve the problem of the
                        industry. Even if an increase in tariffs were an adequate solution, however,
                        there are most compelling reasons for avoiding tariff increases so long as
                        any other remedy is available. Briefly, these reasons are: <list>

                            <item>The leadership of the United States in international affairs has
                                already been seriously damaged by a series of recent actions that
                                other countries are interpreting as a retreat to economic
                                isolationism. Among such actions are the imposition of import quotas
                                on a number of agricultural products, the rigid application of the
                                “Buy American” principle, the withholding of appraisement on imports
                                in “anti-dumping” cases, a rapid series of escape clause
                                recommendations by the Tariff Commission, the subsidization of
                                agricultural exports in competition with the commercial exports of
                                other countries, and, most recently, the abandonment of the
                                Administration plan for expanded trade agreement authority at this
                                session of Congress.</item>

                            <item>Canada, our natural ally in foreign policy, would be particularly
                                hard hit. The Canadian Government and people are deeply worried
                                about our recent restrictions on agricultural imports from Canada
                                and our export subsidies on some important Canadian export crops.

                            <item>Our present tariff rates on lead and zinc are bound by
                                international agreement to 11 producing countries: Canada,
                                Australia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands,
                                Norway, Italy, France, Germany, and Peru. In addition, Mexico and
                                Bolivia would be hard hit. These include many of the most important
                                countries on whom we depend to support our political policies in
                                Europe, the Far East and in Latin America. Yugoslavia, which is in a
                                difficult situation, counts heavily on sales of lead to the United
                                States to earn dollars. In the few days since the Commission’s
                                recommendation has been available we have received sharp protests
                                from most of these countries. A summary of other governments’ views
                                and the texts of their notes are attached.<note n="3"

                                to this memorandum. I might say here though that we are planning two
                                important inter-American meetings during the next few months, one to
                                eliminate the communist problem in Guatemala, and the other to
                                review the entire field of our economic relations with Latin
                                America. The interest of every Latin American government is
                                concentrated on the question of whether this Administration will
                                take measures which would have the effect of reducing present levels
                                of their exports to the United States. An increase in tariffs on
                                lead and zinc at this time would have serious repercussions
                                throughout Latin America and would weaken our position at both
                                inter-American conferences mentioned.</item>

                            <item>The United States is not, and cannot be, independent of lead and
                                zinc imports even in peacetime. In time of emergency we desperately
                                need these metals. During the period of shortage from 1950–1952 we
                                urged other producing countries to sell to us within our price
                                ceilings and not to take advantage of higher world prices. Canada
                                and Mexico, who are high-cost producers—and particularly Canada
                                whose labor costs are comparable with our own—would be the most
                                seriously affected by increased tariffs. These are the two countries
                                on whose production we should be able to depend in case of
                                war.</item>

                        recommended, and you approved, a policy of expanded stockpile objectives.
                        This policy was designed to provide the United States with full security in
                        case of emergency and incidentally to prevent the kind of hardship now being
                        suffered by the domestic lead and zinc mining industry. A program of
                        stockpile purchases for lead and zinc within the expanded <pb n="203"
                            xml:id="pg_203" facs="0229"/>objective should be instituted without
                        delay. If it should prove that the quantities that can be bought under such
                        a program are not sufficient to meet the problem, a subsidy or other direct
                        support other than tariffs should be considered. This would be consistent
                        with your message to the Congress transmitting the report of the Commission
                        on Foreign Economic Policy.</p>
                    <p>The Department urges therefore that you reject the recommendations of the
                        Commission and use the authority available to you to meet the problem in a
                        way that would both be much more effective and would avoid the serious
                        international consequences that are certain to result from the erection of
                        additional barriers against imports from friendly countries.<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d57fn5">Secretary Dulles, in a meeting with President Eisenhower
                            on June 14, 1954, expressed the opinion that an increased tariff on lead
                            and zinc would have very serious repercussions on U.S. hemispheric
                            relations, particularly in Latin America where the United States was
                            trying to organize political support against the Communists in
                            Guatemala. The President replied that he would be inclined to reject the
                            increased tariff if some alternative such as a subsidy could be found.
                            He requested the Secretary to initiate an effort to find such an
                            alternative. (Memorandum by the Secretary of State’s Special Assistant

                    <p>British felt proposal was logically consistent with US ideas on methods of

                        Article 35 to terminate certain obligations. British also stressed their
                        proposal was maximum politically acceptable in UK.</p>
                    <p>After stressing political problems faced by US in connection Japanese
                        negotiations, Waugh said first reaction to UK proposal was that it would
                        weaken <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, especially if others would
                        want similar bilaterals. British agreed this was danger but suggested
                        bilaterals could be limited to <gloss target="#t_CP2">CP</gloss>s which had
                        invoked Article 35 in past or had to do so this occasion. Possible time
                        limit on bilateral discussed—best thought could be provision for review and
                        possible termination if no longer needed, say after five years.</p>
                    <p>British stressed their intention of limiting scope of bilateral, probably to
                        cover only (a) non-automatic removal of discrimination and (b) more flexible
                        emergency action of kind not now possible under <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss>. Probably Anglo-Japanese tariff concessions would be in
                        regular <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> schedules, not in
                        bilateral.</p>
                    <p>British will not be ready to discuss this proposal in intersessional and
                        still want to avoid defining their position at that meeting. Proposed

                    <p>I discussed thoroughly with the Mexican Ambassador and his Economic Counselor
                        the relative effect upon Mexico of a tariff of approximately 1½ cents per
                        pound on lead and zinc and a subsidy of 4 cents per pound on the first 200
                        tons of lead and zinc produced in this country.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador was not at all concerned about a subsidy but urged that a
                        tariff would very adversely affect Mexico.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador and his Counselor regarded as entirely fallacious the argument
                        that a tariff would increase the demand for imported lead and zinc because
                        United States marginal producers would close down, thus reducing domestic
                        United States production. His reasons were: <list>

                            <item>The tonnage by which elimination of United States marginal mines
                                would reduce domestic production is negligible in terms of Mexico’s
                                exports to the United States. In any event, that tonnage would
                                immediately be made up by increased production from mines remaining
                                in operation.</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>The real injury which a tariff increase does to Mexico is its
                                effect on her ability to compete with United States producers who
                                remain in production. Her competitive position would be seriously
                                impaired. Any increase in the United States price that a tariff
                                increase might cause would be more than offset by the increase in
                                the tariff barrier that Mexico would have to overcome to reach that
                                market. For example, if, as is expected, a tariff increase of 1½
                                cents per pound should raise the United States domestic price by ½
                                cent per pound, the net result would be: <list>

                        convince us of the undesirability of a tariff increase. He offered to have

                            <item>The present administration began with a marked leftist trend which
                                gave Communists greater influence than they have exerted in years.
                                That trend accelerated during 1953. In the past six months it has
                                been arrested and in recent weeks it has begun to move strongly in
                                the opposite direction. There is reason to hope that some Communist
                                sympathizers may be eliminated from some important government posts.
                                This is an occurrence of crucial importance to the United States.
                                Therefore, we should weigh carefully the effect on Mexico of our
                                moves during the next few months.<note n="3" xml:id="d59fn3"
                                    >Telegram 312 to Mexico City, Sept. 10, 1954, reported that
                                    President Eisenhower had declined to accept the Tariff
                                    Commission’s recommendations to raise the duty on lead and zinc
                                    and had announced an alternative program of stepped-up U.S.
                                    Government purchases from domestic lead and zinc producers to
                                    increase the U.S. stockpile of these materials. The telegram
                                    continued that the President’s decision was difficult in view of
                                    the unemployment in small U.S. mines and the strong domestic
                                    pressure generated by the unanimous recommendation of the Tariff
                                    Commission. It therefore urged the Embassy to point out to the
                                    Mexican Government that increased Mexican exports of lead and
                                    zinc to the United States could frustrate the President’s
                                    program and make an eventual tariff increase inevitable.

                        the inability of the United States to accept any further limitation on the
                        use of quotas on agricultural imports will block our joint efforts to
                        achieve a successful renegotiation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
                        Trade. In particular, it might make impossible the acceptance by other
                        countries of more stringent rules on the use of balance-of-payment
                        restrictions, which have served importantly to hinder the export of American
                        agricultural commodities. The note also points out that failure of the
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> negotiations would have serious
                        economic and, hence, political consequences.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Makins told me that this note should be regarded as a message from
                        Foreign Secretary Eden, with the full support of the British Cabinet. He
                        said that the note also reflects the views held by the Commonwealth
                        countries generally.</p>
                    <p>I understand that our two Departments have spent many hours in arriving at an
                        agreed position on Section 22 for use by our <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> Delegation at Geneva. That position, in essence, is that
                        we cannot undertake any commitment that would involve an amendment of
                        Section 22. We are prepared fully to support this presently agreed position.
                        We strongly doubt, however, that our Delegation at Geneva will be able to
                        persuade the other <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> countries to agree
                        to abolish balance-of-payment quotas when at the same time we refuse to
                        accept any significant limitation on our use of agricultural import quotas.
                        It is quite clear, therefore, that our position on <pb n="208"
                            xml:id="pg_208" facs="0234"/>the use of agricultural quotas will be the
                        greatest obstacle to reaching international agreement on a revised <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>As you know, the President attaches great importance to the successful
                        conclusion of these negotiations. I should appreciate your giving the
                        problem of Section 22 your personal attention to see if anything might be
                        done to strengthen the position of our Delegation at Geneva if the fears
                        described above are realized. A renegotiated <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> will be of direct benefit to American agriculture and to
                        our foreign relations generally. I am sure you will agree that we should
                        give the Delegation every possible assistance we can on this problem.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>At our Delegation meeting this morning we were asked to consider how, given
                        that we do not modify Section 22 in any way, we should meet this problem in
                        the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. I would like to raise again a
                        more fundamental question of whether we should not seek to modify our
                        substantive position on Section 22 and try to reach agreement with the
                        countries here on a reasonable agricultural <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209"
                            facs="0235"/>provision even if it should require our going to the
                        Congress to seek an amendment of Section 22.</p>
                    <p>I think I am fully appreciative of all the difficulties that following the
                        latter course would entail for us domestically and with the Congress. I
                        wonder, however, for reasons suggested below, whether it would not be
                        possible for us to follow such a course and still attain our objectives in
                        the Congress—and on a more satisfactory basis than if we adhered to our
                        present position.</p>
                    <p>Before going into the details of what I would like to propose, I should like
                        to emphasize that my concern about our present position on Section 22 is not
                        so much as to our ability to get other countries to accept it, as it is with
                        respect to the great cost that we are likely to have to pay to achieve our
                        position. Our position on Section 22 weakens our entire posture in the
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. In particular, it is going to
                        make it exceedingly difficult, if indeed it will be possible at all, to get
                        in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> the kind of balance-of-payments
                        provisions we would like to see. It is affording the basis on which other
                        countries, for example the Germans, are seeking broad exemptions to apply
                        restrictions to protect their farmers—restrictions which will materially
                        impair the opportunities for American agricultural exports abroad.</p>
                    <p>In any case, aside from these substantive aspects, it would seem unlikely on
                        the basis of our present position on Section 22 that we shall come out of
                        these negotiations with a result which will be palatable to the Congress.
                        The other countries here are not likely to accept the technique of giving us
                        an exemption for Section 22 in the form of changing the date in the Protocol
                        of Provisional Application. But even if they were, the advantage
                        domestically for us in getting such an exemption must be offset by the
                        political disadvantage at home in coming back to the Congress with an
                        agreement which fails to do much, if anything, to get rid of
                        balance-of-payments restrictions against American exports and which further
                        opens the way for other countries to apply restrictions on US exports of
                        agricultural commodities.</p>
                    <p>Are there other techniques for meeting this problem in the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> in a way which would not require a change
                        in Section 22 and in a way which avoids the political difficulties we fear
                        if we should seek an amendment to Section 22?</p>
                    <p>I am inclined to doubt it. Some countries have suggested that we ought to
                        seek a waiver under Article XXV<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2">Under Article
                            XXV, two-thirds of the Contracting Parties to the <gloss

                            upon a Contracting Party but would have the right to prescribe whatever
                            conditions or criteria they desired for the execution of the

                        granted, I would think that it would be limited in some way, either
                        time-wise or on the basis of some general standards, so that we would not in
                        fact be able to go back to the Congress and say that we have a completely
                        free hand as regards Section 22. Walter Hollis<note n="3" xml:id="d62fn3">A
                            member of the U.S. Delegation.</note> has made a suggestion for a
                        provision in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> which would allow us
                        to go as far as the letter of Section 22 might permit but which, if we went
                        that far, would authorize retaliatory action against us. I doubt that the
                        Congress would be happy with any such provision explicitly sanctioning
                        retaliatory action against us if we apply Section 22 up to the maximum it
                        might allow or require.</p>
                    <p>Since we would seem to face all these political difficulties with the
                        Congress in trying to maintain Section 22 under the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss>, I wonder if it would not be better for us to take all
                        these political difficulties in fighting for a provision we believe is
                        reasonable and defensible, one which enables us to obtain a more
                        satisfactory result generally in our negotiations in the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, and one which leaves us with a result
                        more fully in accord with our national interest.</p>
                    <p>What I would like to suggest for consideration, therefore, is that we return
                        to our proposal to allow import restrictions in order to safeguard domestic
                        agricultural programs, provided, however, that such restrictions are not
                        applied to cut off normal imports, that is, imports which would have come in
                        even if we had not had any domestic program. I think any reasonable person
                        would agree that such a provision would be fair, to us as well as to
                        foreigners. Its inherent equity would, it seems to me, provide an extremely
                        powerful argument to persuade the Congress to accept it. Indeed, it can be
                        argued with some force that the purpose of Section 22 even as it is now
                        written is not to curtail normal imports but only those imports which have
                        been attracted by our domestic support programs.</p>
                    <p>If in addition to the essential reasonableness of this proposal, we could
                        also show the Congress that we have got in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> tighter balance-of-payments provisions and other
                        limitations which will promote American exports generally and agricultural
                        exports in particular, we would have a very strong basis for persuading the
                        Congress to accept the change in Section 22 involved. With the “normal
                        imports” approach suggested above, we would have a very good chance of
                        getting in our negotiations here the kind of balance-of-payments provisions
                        the Congress would like to see and of avoiding any general opening up of the
                        door to other countries to impose restrictions on agricultural imports from
                        us and others.</p>
                    <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0237"/>
                    <p>Let us assume, however, that despite the reasonableness of this proposal and
                        despite the fact that it enabled us to get a <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> otherwise highly satisfactory to the Congress, the latter
                        refused to accept any provision in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                        involving a modification of Section 22. It would seem to me that in such
                        circumstances, we, at worst, might still get our Organization Agreement
                        through the Congress, with some sort of reservation to the effect that
                        acceptance of the Agreement by the Congress is subject to our further
                        renegotiating the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> so as to give us a
                        free hand with regard to Section 22.</p>
                    <p>If we did wind up with such a reservation, we could then go back to the
                        Contracting Parties and seek such a provision as we are now attempting to
                        get—and, in my judgment, we could seek such a provision with much better
                        results and under circumstances much more propitious to the achievement of
                        our objectives. If we had such a reservation, we would be coming back to the
                        Contracting Parties <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> had already been tightened up in the

                        reservation.</p>
                    <p>If you feel there is some merit in the above line of argument, I wonder if it
                        would not be useful for us to discuss the matter with Congressman Cooper and
                        with Senator Gore when he arrives to get their reaction.<note n="4"

                        a few days ago by Ambassador Makins relative to the desire to impose some
                        limitations on our use of Section 22 in the forthcoming <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> negotiations in Geneva.</p>
                    <p>I agree with you that this issue is a tough one. Our two Departments spent
                        considerable time together on this question before the United States
                        delegation left for the Geneva meetings. I understand that our Departments
                        reached an agreement. We note that <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0238"
                        />your Department is fully prepared to support the presently agreed
                        position. We appreciate this, especially because we realize the very
                        difficult situation in which it places your negotiators in their attempts to
                        obtain concessions from foreign countries with respect to balance of payment
                        quotas and the like.</p>
                    <p>I don’t see how we can change the position we are taking in Geneva. Section
                        22 is an Act of Congress. It would be quite presumptuous on the part of the
                        Executive Branch of Government to attempt to negotiate away this feature of
                        our legislation in an international session such as the one currently
                        meeting in Geneva. The Department of Agriculture can determine
                        administratively to use authorities under Section 22 more or less
                        frequently, but legally the Department cannot negotiate away its right to
                        make such administrative determination. To do so would obviously circumvent
                        the directive from Congress, and would surely invite severe criticism of the
                        Department in Congress.</p>
                    <p>The United States delegation is not without bargaining power in the Geneva
                        sessions, even though not yielding on the Section 22 issue. We are moving in
                        the direction of less dependence on Section 22 in the following way: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The flexible farm price support provision in the Agricultural Act
                                of 1954 provides for gradually lowered levels of price support for
                                farm products. This will reduce the necessity for such large CCC
                                purchases of farm products, and will consequently reduce or even
                                eliminate the need for imposition of import quotas under Section 22.
                                Flexible farm price supports will also tend to narrow the wide
                                disparity which has existed between domestic price levels and
                                foreign price levels for selected farm products. This will further
                                reduce the need for import quotas.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The Eisenhower Administration is definitely dedicated to a general
                                restoration of foreign trade on a multilateral basis. The Department
                                of Agriculture subscribes to this point of view. It is therefore the
                                administrative philosophy in Agriculture to institute the
                                authorities under Section 22 with considerable restraint.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>We are working vigorously to reduce Government-owned stocks of
                                food and fiber. We are making substantial progress. As these stocks
                                are reduced the necessity to impose import restrictions is
                                lessened.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>It also should be pointed out by the U.S. delegation that domestic price
                        supports in the United States, together with large CCC purchases of surplus
                        farm products, have provided a “price umbrella” for producers in many other
                        countries, under which their own markets flourished and production expanded.
                        Many foreign producer groups have therefore gained indirectly from the U.S.
                        price support operations, even though not participating directly in the
                        artificially supported U.S. market.</p>
                    <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0239"/>
                    <p>We believe that if the United States delegation at Geneva can strongly
                        advance the arguments listed above, their bargaining position will be far
                        from hopeless.</p>
                    <p>Please be assured that the Department of Agriculture is anxious to cooperate
                        in every way possible to reduce international barriers to a freer flow of
                        goods and services.</p>

                        important national interest considerations involved in the tariff
                        negotiations to expand Japan’s trade. Following are the points we believe
                        should be emphasized: <list>

                            <item>As the President and the cabinet have previously concluded, an
                                expansion of Japan’s trading opportunities with free-world countries
                                is essential to our basic security interests, and is the only
                                alternative to continuing economic aid at the expense of U.S.

                                the negotiations, all within the framework of the General Agreement

                            <item>The strengthening of the Japanese economy is not only imperative
                                for our national security but is also consistent with our best
                                economic interests. The recent publication of items proposed for
                                tariff negotiations will undoubtedly result in strong protests from
                                various groups. These protests, however, must be balanced against

                    <p>Tagg 100. Pass White House for Randall and Hauge. It is becoming increasingly
                        apparent that one of the main factors bearing upon the success or failure of
                        this conference from the US point of view is the extent to which we can
                        agree to consultation with respect to subsidies, section 22 and disposal of
                        non-commercial stocks.</p>
                    <p>We are seeking (a) rules which will not unduly limit our use of subsidies,
                        (b) to preserve our right to use section 22 under as open-ended a waiver as
                        possible, and (c) to prevent the new agreement from dealing with commodity
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>Some countries want to prohibit subsidies; most want to see them strictly
                        limited, but want a tighter rule than the necessarily vague concept of
                        equitable share. They can probably be persuaded to accept this concept if
                        assured of a right to consultation. Delegation would argue that adequate
                        opportunity for discussion is assured by present article XVI amended to
                        require prompt consultation on request country claiming adverse effect.
                        Delegation requests authority agree such amendment.</p>
                    <p>Most countries realize that we must have a waiver for section 22. The
                        question will be upon what terms. The terms can be made far more liberal and
                        open-ended if countries affected have the assurance that they will be
                        consulted as Canada has been consulted. <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215"
                            facs="0241"/>Canada will testify to the generally satisfactory results
                        of such consultation for them.</p>
                    <p>Large majority of countries want <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> to
                        deal with commodity policy as way of minimizing fluctuation in commodity
                        prices. One important unsettling factor which concerns them is possibility
                        sudden large liquidation US strategic stocks. Will greatly help defeating
                        inclusion commodity policy provisions if their advocates can point to legal
                        commitment for prior notice and consultation on liquidation of such stocks.
                        Requirement such consultation would be wholly consistent with conclusions

                        outside present provisions <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and invoke
                        such unusual factors affecting normal competition as sales for local

                    <p>Worry about these programs is one of their greatest concerns and degree
                        reassurance this point they can take home will bear heavily on extent they
                        can agree other provisions we want. Delegation believes this need could be
                        met and undue tying of US hands could be avoided if Delegation were
                        authorized to make formal statement that it would be US policy in
                        administering <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 and 665 to consult with
                        countries whose interests might be adversely affected with view minimizing
                        or avoiding such effects.</p>
                    <p>Foregoing well illustrated by case of Australia, which is one of most
                        troublesome situations in conference.</p>
                    <p>Australia appears to be genuinely considering whether it will remain in or
                        leave <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> with slight preference for
                        remaining if possible. This important because of Australia’s key position as
                        industrialized country in Southeast Asia and member of British Commonwealth
                        with contractual obligations to other Commonwealth countries under Ottawa
                        Agreements. Australian Delegation is making difficulties on whole series of
                        points, e.g., <gloss target="#t_CP2">CP</gloss> approval of balance of past
                        payments <gloss target="#t_QR1">QR</gloss>, role of <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                            >IMF</gloss>, inclusion of commodity provisions, change in no new

                        22.</p>
                    <p>Delegation has reviewed entire field exhaustively with Australians.
                        Conclusion is that their major difficulties could be met if US could give
                        assurances on consultation suggested above. By consultation <pb n="216"
                            xml:id="pg_216" facs="0242"/>we do not mean agreement, but simply
                        sufficient opportunity to make their views known and suggest result that
                        would avoid undue damage their interests. Hard bargaining will be necessary
                        with Australia on many points they have raised, but convinced agreement can
                        be reached if this central point of consultation established. Australians
                        advise they prepared station and maintain man permanently in Washington
                        fully qualified conduct consultations their behalf.</p>
                    <p>Randall Commission report page 32 advocates “continue policy and extend
                        practice of consulting” on export subsidies and import quotas.</p>
                    <p>Refusal US accept principle consultation implies insincerity in professions
                        we do not intend injure trade of others and puts US in position of reserving
                        right to use vast financial resources to possible serious detriment of
                        others without giving them chance to be heard.</p>
                    <p>Such refusal would be doubly harmful our negotiating position and general
                        standing conference in view fact that US has in fact consulted with Canada
                        on section 22 quotas with generally satisfactory results, has already
                        accepted obligation of prior consultation under article XX, part II, (c)
                        with respect to liquidation of temporary surpluses of stocks owned by
                        government, has general obligation to consult under article XXII, accepted
                        resolution on consultation with respect to liquidation of stockpiles at last
                        Latin American Ministers conference, states in September 9 policy statement
                        that it does not desire injure other friendly countries in its disposal
                        operations, and that Randall Commission advocated consultation.</p>
                    <p>Delegation fully appreciates that consultation will involve many practical
                        difficulties and that some countries may endeavor abuse this right. But
                        convinced these will be minority and that beneficial results will far
                        outweigh disadvantages not only with respect success this conference, but
                        with respect general long-run interests US and actual effectiveness our
                        disposal programs.</p>
                    <p>Delegation therefore requests authorization (a) agree in principle commitment
                        consult on liquidation of strategic stocks, specific proposals to be
                        submitted to Washington for approval, (b) consider if necessary consultation

                    <p>The President opened the meeting by noting that the past year had left much
                        unfinished business, which would constitute a large <pb n="218"
                            xml:id="pg_218" facs="0244"/>part of the program for the coming year,
                        and that there would not be a great deal of material new to the Leaders. He
                        felt the task of getting a program through would be more difficult because
                        of Democratic control of the Congress, that there would have to be some
                        experimentation on procedures in dealing with this new situation, but that
                        it was helpful to have already developed pretty well procedures for doing
                        business among Republicans.</p>
                    <p>[Here follow the President’s comments relating to the topics to be covered,
                        followed by discussion of various budgetary, foreign policy, defense, and
                        mutual security issues. For text of the section on mutual security, see <ref
                            target="#pg_810">page 810</ref>.]</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Trade Program</hi>—Mr. Randall stated that the 1954
                        proposal for extending the Reciprocal Trade Act and related items would be
                        resubmitted with a few minor revisions. He quickly reviewed some of the
                        items in the program, stressing the problem of Japanese trade. In this
                        connection, he noted some peril point hearings currently underway, and how
                        sensitive the Japanese are to every single one of these proceedings. Mr.
                        Millikin asked whether the action re Japan would be by quotas or by
                        revisions of rates. Mr. Randall said it was undecided, and the President
                        stressed the need for doing something.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Millikin then opened a lengthy discussion over <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss>. He thought it very important to iron out the status of
                        that organization prior to action on Reciprocal Trade. Also, he suggested an
                        alternative of “trading out” rather than providing a particular authority to
                        the President. When Mr. Randall suggested it might be best to keep details
                        of the bill “off the floor” Sen. Knowland asserted that inclusion of such a
                        provision was not the way to keep details off the floor. Mr. Randall then
                        agreed it might have to be cleaned up a bit, and he appreciated Sen.
                        Millikin’s strong convictions. He pointed out, however, that the President
                        instructs the State Department on what lines to carry on negotiations and he
                        felt the President had to have that power.</p>
                    <p>(The President departed for lunch with the Shah.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. Halleck stated how difficult it would be to enlist Republican support for
                        this bill, and he inquired whether the bill could be made “any easier to
                        love” or was it already set at an irreducible minimum. Randall replied that
                        the whole program had been reviewed after Congress adjourned, and that this
                        now was at the minimum. Sen. Knowland thereupon spoke of how the great value
                        of these leadership meetings lay in their use for reconciling divergent
                        views, how foreign trade was essentially a Congressional matter although
                        some of its authority had been delegated to the Executive, and how the
                        required votes were to be found in the Congress rather than in the
                        Commission which had advanced this program. <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219"
                            facs="0245"/>He thought that the proposal ought to be adjusted somewhat
                        along the lines suggested by Millikin if there was any value in having the
                        advice of the leaders, and he thought that Mr. Randall ought to keep his own
                        mind flexible for these discussions as well. Mr. Randall replied that his
                        task was to present the recommendations in which he believed, and that it
                        was a different matter as to what the President and the leaders concluded
                        after that presentation was once made. Mr. Knowland repeated that he and his
                        associates were trying to get to a meeting of the minds so that the
                        Executive and the Party majority would not be taking opposite positions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Halleck thought perhaps it would be best to eliminate this item from the
                        agenda for the next day. Gov. Adams suggested that further discussion be
                        postponed until the afternoon session when the President would again be at
                        hand. The discussion was then concluded as Mr. Morgan repeated that the bill
                        was the same as in the preceding session, and as Mr. Randall assured Sen.
                        Millikin that the Congress would not be approving <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> by its action on this proposal. Mr. Halleck said he would
                        go along as necessary now that he understood it was the same bill as last
                        year.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of several miscellaneous issues, after which the
                        meeting adjourned for lunch. It reconvened at 2:55 p.m. with President
                        Eisenhower present.]</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Reciprocal Trade</hi>—The President said he had been
                        informed of the discussion that followed his departure prior to lunch. As
                        for <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, he understood that our
                        negotiating group had been given clear instructions that everything new
                        would have to be submitted to the Congress before taking effect. He recalled
                        that the Randall program had been thrashed out last year. Even while he
                        recognized that many differences of opinion existed, he wanted to emphasize
                        that this was very much a part of the program in which he believed and which
                        he represented. Noting that the United States spends billions in arms, he
                        asserted that all such money would be inadequate to what we need unless we
                        do something to enable some of our allies to make a living; and we could do
                        that without ruining our own country. He concluded by describing the Randall
                        proposal as essentially a middle of the road approach.</p>
                    <p>Sen. Millikin explained that he did not object to the advisory and
                        consultative functions of <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, but he
                        wanted no part of regulation by a supra-national authority to which the
                        Senate had repeatedly objected. The power belonged to the Congress, not to a
                        supra-national body. The President said this was the first time he had ever
                        heard the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> procedures being challenged,
                        and if there was something wrong with them, they ought to be re-examined.
                            <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0246"/>Millikin repeated that <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> had never been submitted to Congress,
                        that the Senate caveats had always been ignored.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Randall assured the group that the Attorney General was keeping in close
                        touch with the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> negotiations and would
                        be able to insure protection against any improper supra-national
                        arrangement. Mr. Randall received approval for limiting his presentation to
                        the bipartisan, group the next day to a simple statement of the proposal
                        being resubmitted. The President thought Randall ought add a short statement
                        about the Japanese trade problem. The discussion concluded as Millikin
                        joshingly urged Randall to leave the Congress some elbow-room, and Randall
                        replied in kind about the big elbows of the Congress!</p>

                    <p>Opportunities continue for disposing of substantial quantities of surplus,
                        mainly butter, with final destination the Soviet Bloc. These are proposals
                        by friendly countries to buy for dollars at market prices. Some are offers
                        of brokerage for shipment to the Soviet or Satellites; some to take
                        commodities for reworking and transshipment; some to consume totally within
                        the friendly country, releasing local produce for shipment behind the
                        Curtain.</p>
                    <p>A previous concensus of the Cabinet (January 15, 1954) was to deny a license
                        to export butter to the U.S.S.R. The reasons, appearing in the <hi
                            rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>, were: (a) we should not sell this
                        commodity at a loss; (b) there might be adverse public reaction if the U.S.
                            <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0248"/>sold butter to Russia at a
                        price below that paid by American housewives.</p>
                    <p>If reason (a) is controlling, this avenue of possible disposal is blocked,
                        inasmuch as the cost price to the CCC tends to be above world market prices
                        for the same commodity, because of the operation of domestic price
                        supports.</p>
                    <p>If, however, reason (a) alone would not preclude such sales in the absence of
                        other reasons, it may be that the introduction into the transaction of a
                        friendly third country (which stands to benefit by it) could have an effect
                        on reason (b).</p>
                    <p>The Department of Agriculture has been unable to devise a politically
                        feasible plan or one not involving risk of ruinous cost for domestic
                        disposal of butter surpluses.</p>
                    <p>The Interagency Committee on Agricultural Surplus Disposal (ICASD) feels that
                        the policy on this question should be reviewed. It is the Committee’s
                        opinion, in respect of reason (b) above, that the judgment of the American
                        people can be relied on if a full and honest disclosure of the situation is
                        made.</p>

                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>(a) That the President approve in principle the sale for dollars at
                            competitive prices of surplus agricultural commodities to friendly
                            countries, even though such commodities may ultimately go to the Soviet
                            bloc or be available to it;</item>
                        <label/>
                        <item>(b) that the President authorize the agencies concerned to proceed to
                            negotiate such transactions as presently offer or as may offer and can
                            be negotiated within 90 days from this date and authorize the Secretary
                            of Commerce to issue export licenses therefor; and</item>
                        <label/>
                        <item>(c) that the Chairman of the Interagency Committee on Agricultural
                            Surplus Disposal be directed to report to the Cabinet at the end of that
                            period the nature of such transactions, together with an estimate of
                            their effects at home and abroad.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>If the first recommendation is accepted, the Committee proposes that
                            the idea of direct sales to the Soviet Bloc for dollars (but not for
                            gold) be entertained and recommends that the President approve such
                            sales on the same basis as described in the first recommendation. The
                            Treasury Department and the Bureau of the Budget reserve their positions
                            on this recommendation.</item>

                    <p>The President opened the meeting with a reference to the traditional
                        practices of wedge-driving which he believed would undoubtedly be
                        intensified in the months ahead. He stated his desire to avoid anything that
                        would serve to gag Cabinet members. He hoped, however, that Cabinet members
                        would merely laugh at any wedge-driving efforts. He also recalled the
                        success the Cabinet had had thus far in resolving differences of opinion by
                        discussion in a friendly fashion.</p>

                                <ref target="#pg_220">p. 220</ref>.</note>—Mr. Francis summarized
                        the material in <gloss target="#t_CP2">CP</gloss>–8 and set the question as
                        one of whether the program was overly cautious or overly liberal.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired as to how much money would be returned to the United
                        States through these operations. Mr. Francis believed only about 10 percent
                        would come back in dollars. Mr. Francis then pointed out, and Mr. Hoover
                        noted agreement, that this program had not been set up as a means of saving
                        money on other programs. Mr. Hoover commented at length on the many
                        difficulties with which this program is fraught and he illustrated with
                        details from the wheat-for-Brazil program and the added involvements caused
                        by the negotiations between Argentina and Brazil.</p>
                    <p>Sec. Benson questioned whether the program as set up really carried out the
                        intent of Congress, particularly in regard to improvement of trade. Mr.
                        Francis believed it did.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Flemming asked about the extent to which Title I had been used for
                        supplementary stockpiling of critical materials. The President commented on
                        his desire to see the United States exchange perishables for durables. Mr.
                        Francis said much more could be acquired for the stockpiling if the door
                        were to be opened in his other paper. Mr. Benson produced some figures
                        concerning stockpile acquisitions but it developed that this involved Title
                        III and that <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> paid for the material in
                        dollars.</p>

                        Department’s objection to the proposal for offering some 20 million pounds
                        of butter on the world market on a bid basis. He recalled the protests made
                        a year ago in regard to the similar program for cottonseed and linseed oil,
                        and he emphasized that a favorable result had been obtained despite the
                        pessimistic predictions, and that the market price was now rising without
                        the threat of an overhanging surplus.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Benson believed this program would enable a testing of the world market
                        price and that it was to be done in such a small quantity that there would
                        be no danger of serious repercussions. In reply to the President, Mr. Butz
                        pointed out that the effect of offering butter on a bid basis would probably
                        result in a price offering of 38¢.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that the expected income from the sale of this amount
                        was too small to risk the loss of good will on <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225"
                            facs="0251"/>the part of our friends to whom the sale of their butter
                        was a life and death matter. On the other hand, he believed that there must
                        be some place in the world where our butter could be used without
                        endangering our friends. In this connection, Mr. Hoover had no objection to
                        the use of the <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 program. Mr. Benson
                        emphasized that the current world price of 41¢ was undoubtedly too high
                        because of governmental operations in the market, including our own
                        government. Mr. Hoover requested time for the State Department to explore
                        the matter with our allies involved. The President so directed, adding a
                        comment that State should emphasize to our allies that the proposal was for
                        experimental purposes and on a very limited basis.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Francis questioned how his Committee could dispose of surpluses except
                        through programs such as this. The President emphasized the importance of
                        other problems, such as world affairs, and commented that other members of
                        our “family of nations” should not be compelled to pay for the domestic
                        blunder of the United States when it got into the business of accumulating
                        these surpluses.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Francis then presented <gloss target="#t_CP2">CP</gloss>–9. The President
                        repeatedly emphasized his desire to exchange perishables for durables. Mr.
                        Wilson wished to conduct barter operations, as did Mr. Weeks. Mr. Benson
                        pointed out that the previous determination not to sell butter to Russia at
                        a price lower than that paid by American housewives was obsolete now that
                        our domestic price was much lower.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hobby emphasized the desirability of having any sales go to our friends
                        rather than directly to Russia.</p>
                    <p>The discussion then turned to the phrasing of any announcements. When it
                        appeared that publicity was not to be given to this decision, Mr. Francis
                        emphasized that he could not keep the transaction secret and that the
                        decision would have to be made in the knowledge that it would be public in
                        the near future.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President commented that the whole problem of trade with the Iron
                        Curtain countries was being increasingly recognized as one on which some
                        progress had to be made. He recognized that the public relations problem
                        would always exist but he felt that if the decision were to be in favor of a
                        revised approach, the present was exactly the right time to begin making a
                        little progress. He felt that controversy would surround the first step to
                        be taken but that once the barrier had been broken further progress could be
                        made without so great difficulty.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wilson believed the action would be consistent with other more important
                        decisions made as to the imminence of war.</p>
                    <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0252"/>
                    <p>The President noted that the United States undertakes spiritual, military,
                        and material programs in foreign affairs. He believed that the standard of
                        judgment in regard to such material programs as are undertaken should be
                        essentially that of “net advantage”.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hoover felt it necessary to note that this action by the United States
                        would run in the opposite direction to the things we have been encouraging
                        on other countries in the question of trade with Communist countries.<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d69fn3">In a memorandum dated Dec. 16, 1954, Deputy
                            Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs Kalijarvi recommended to Acting
                            Secretary of State Hoover that at the Dec. 17 Cabinet meeting “you
                            reiterate the Department’s position with respect to this question [sale
                            of agricultural surplus to the Soviet Union], namely, that there is no
                            foreign policy obstacle to transactions in surplus commodities with
                            Curtain countries; and that the public relations aspects of the problem
                            in the U.S. are the primary concern of other agencies.”
                            (411.0031/12–1654)</note> Mr. Allen Dulles spoke to the same effect with
                        regard to sales of rice to Communist China by Far Eastern countries.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that all facts in the matter did not seem to have
                        been available for discussion, and he directed that the State Department
                        examine the question more closely before any action was taken.</p>
                    <p>Sec. Benson questioned whether this outcome affected existing policy for
                        selling soy beans for dollars to satellites of Russia. The President
                        believed they should be sold to any country in the world for dollars or on a
                        barter basis.</p>

                            implication that the U.S. would support the establishment of a grant
                            fund if his advice were followed.</item>

                    <p>In view of the controversial character of the subject and the widespread
                        interest in it, you may wish to inform the President of the proposed
                        position, provided, of course, you agree with it. The Treasury and certain
                        other agencies probably feel that the U.S. should have nothing whatsoever to
                        do with preparing a blueprint on the ground that participation cannot help
                        but compromise our ultimate stand. From a foreign policy viewpoint, however,
                        we simply are not free to remain aloof. We have tried persistently to
                        strengthen the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and have castigated the

                    <p>About two weeks ago I mentioned to you the General Assembly resolution on an
                        international grant fund for economic development. <pb n="230"
                            xml:id="pg_230" facs="0256"/>You said at that time that you would be
                        interested in getting more information on this problem and that you felt it
                        would be particularly useful to have the matter brought to the attention of
                        the Secretary. The attached draft position paper, which will guide our
                        representative in the <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>, outlines
                        the problem and suggests courses of action the United States should take to
                        meet it. This position paper as it now stands has the approval of the
                        interested offices, namely, <gloss target="#t_UNA1">UNA</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_E1">E</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>What I would like to suggest is that, after you and the Secretary have had a
                        chance to go over this paper, it be placed before the Secretary’s Tuesday or
                        Thursday 9:30 meeting for discussion. This is going to be a lively problem
                        for a number of years and it will certainly be useful if the principal
                        officers in the Department are informed regarding the line that will be
                        taken on the problem at <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> and the
                        subsequent <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> meetings.</p>

                            impetus by the Marshall Plan, by the low rate of <gloss

                            to complement loan aid; and, in particular, by the United States
                            Government bilateral program of grant aid to accelerate economic
                            development in selected countries.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government tried to deflect the pressure as it came. It
                            differentiated reconstruction aid with its established time limit from
                            capital for long-run economic development. It pointed to <pb n="232"
                                xml:id="pg_232" facs="0258"/>the available unused resources of the
                                <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, as well as the large volume of
                            development financing actually taking place. It urged the <gloss
                                target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> to take a more aggressive interest in
                            economic development and it offered technical assistance to help
                            countries plan projects suitable for bank lending. It undertook measures
                            to stimulate private capital flow and urged underdeveloped countries to
                            do likewise.</p>
                        <p>Over the last two years, however, the ground has shifted. In <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> debates, it was agreed that loan funds
                            may be adequate for “bankable” projects but it was argued by proponents
                            of an international grant agency that there is need for external grant
                            aid to finance the ‘low-yielding, slow-yielding, social and economic
                            overhead projects“ basic to economic development which cannot be
                            financed by bank loans in the volume needed because they are
                            “non-self-liquidating”. At the same time, given its own grant aid
                            programs, the United States Government acknowledged in public forums
                            that for certain countries and under certain circumstances, grant aid
                            may be necessary to give initial impetus to the development process. The
                            case for grant aid for economic development having been made in theory
                            by the representatives of the developed as well as the underdeveloped
                            countries, and being supported in fact by the action of the United
                            States Government itself, pressure to establish an international grant
                            agency as the more appropriate medium for making such aid available
                            became almost irresistible and culminated in the passage of the General
                            Assembly resolution, by a vote of 30–16, instructing <gloss
                                target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> to prepare a blueprint of an
                            international fund so that such a fund could come into being as soon as
                            circumstances permit.</p>
                        <p>The underdeveloped countries want an international grant agency for many
                            reasons. Not all who voted for the blueprint want it for the same
                            reasons. Some want easy money easily; some want it without offense to
                            their national sensibilities; and some are actually fearful of
                            entanglement through bilateral aid. In the main, the reasons are as
                            follows: (1) They believe the total volume of grant aid would be
                            substantially greater if there were an international grant agency and
                            the process of economic development accelerated thereby; (2) They want a
                            voice in setting the terms and conditions of aid and in the distribution
                            of the funds; (3) They want international recognition of the principle
                            that the developed countries have an obligation under the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter to provide grant aid for economic
                            development, and they want to embody this principle in an institution;
                            (4) They want a “neutral” intermediary between the donors and themselves
                            so as to avoid political entanglements (This is particularly important
                            to those who fear that bilateral aid may diminish their sovereignty or
                            line them up in the cold war. The <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233"

                                Oct. 26, 1951. It provided for the suspension of U.S. economic aid

                            recipients); (5) They want to strengthen the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> by giving it a more active and positive role in
                            promoting economic development.</p>
                        <p>The United States has resisted an international grant agency because: (1)
                            We doubt that there would be substantial and effective contributions
                            from other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members with the result
                            that the United States would have to put up virtually all the funds; (2)
                            We believe an international grant agency would not be an effective
                            instrument to promote economic development. It could well turn into a
                            log-rolling operation with everyone sharing in the pie regardless of
                            need, domestic effort, or capacity to use aid effectively (These are not
                            necessary attributes of an international grant agency but they are the
                            probable outcome); (3) We do not want to provide grant aid as a matter
                            of obligation. We are prepared to do it as a matter of national
                            self-interest; (4) We want to use grant funds selectively. Some
                            countries are more important to us than others; (5) In the present
                            climate, the United States Congress would be unlikely to vote funds for
                            an internationally administered grant fund.</p>
                        <p>In public forums we have emphasized the first and last of these
                            arguments. We have stated that (a) no organization can be truly
                            international unless many countries make substantial and effective
                            contributions, and (b) given the defense effort, the United States is
                            not prepared to increase the scale of its aid at this time. Since all
                            major potential contributors have declared themselves unable or
                            unprepared to contribute at this time because of other commitments, we
                            have argued that this is not the time to set up a fund or the blueprint
                            of a fund. We have never stated that under no circumstances would we
                            support the establishment of an international grant agency.</p>
                        <p>The effect of our resistance has been to widen the rift in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> between developed and underdeveloped
                            countries and further to solidify the so-called Asian-Arab bloc on an
                            issue in which there is growing popular interest. This rift exists even
                            though these same countries are receiving direct bilateral assistance
                            from us. We have, however, not regarded these political effects as
                            critical enough to warrant a reversal of our position. We are presumably
                            prepared to continue our opposition to the establishment of an
                            international <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0260"/>grant agency, and
                            to seek by other means, including bilateral aid, to induce support for

                                        <item>Grants are a form of extraordinary or emergency aid

                                            An international agency to distribute grants for
                                            economic development would normalize and
                                            institutionalize such aid and tend to make it a
                                            permanent feature of international cooperation. Grant
                                            aid would be regarded as a continuing obligation on the

                                        <item>Grants are gifts and not a normal medium of commerce
                                            among nations. Governments that dispose of public funds
                                            in the form of gifts abroad should retain the right to
                                            select the recipients, and control the distribution, of
                                            these public funds. The United States Government, for
                                            example, cannot be expected to ask its taxpayers to make
                                            gifts to governments whose major preoccupation is to
                                            undermine the United States.</item>

                                        <item>There are very few satisfactory objective criteria for
                                            allocating a limited volume of grant funds among
                                            claimant countries. How determine that a hospital in
                                            country X is more important than a road in country Y?
                                            Because judgments in this field must, at certain
                                            critical points, be fairly arbitrary, there is some
                                            danger that an international grant agency would follow
                                            the simple path of log-rolling.</item>

                        <p>With regard to the preparation of the blueprint, <gloss

                            Economic Committee, which is a Committee of the Whole on which all
                                <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> members are represented.
                            Such an assignment would avoid the necessity of the United States <pb
                                n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0261"/>taking a position on

                            solution would be preferable.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, there is strong feeling among other delegations
                            (particularly the UK and Canada) that a working party would be better.
                            In such a smaller committee the discussion could be better kept under
                            control. Consequently, an effort will be made to promote a small working
                            party.</p>
                        <p>The United States should not take a stand on this issue. In the unlikely
                            event that <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> assigns the task to
                            a working party of government representatives, the United States should
                            be prepared to serve if it is asked to do so.</p>
                        <p>Whatever happens, the United States representative will have the
                            difficult job of presenting our views on the structure and functions of
                            an international organization that we are not prepared to support.
                            Nevertheless, we do have views in this matter which should be stated
                            because they may mean the difference between a potentially effective and
                            responsible institution that is truly international (even without our
                            participation) and a wasteful operation. The United States
                            representative should give his best technical advice, therefore, but
                            should not press his views and should avoid as best he can the
                            implication that the United States would support the establishment of a
                            grant fund if his advice were followed.</p>
                        <p>A separate position paper will be needed to give more specific guide
                            lines to the United States representative on the Economic Committee or
                            working party on such matters as the nature of the contributions, the
                            relations of grants to loans, of management to members, the extent of
                            local participation, etc.</p>

                        <item>Mr. Linder reviewed the background of the General Assembly Resolution
                            to establish a grant fund for economic development. He indicated how
                            this Resolution was passed over our opposition in the General Assembly.
                            The question now is the degree to which we should participate on work of
                            the Economic Committee or a working party which might be charged with
                            developing a blueprint for such a fund. He pointed out that the
                            Resolution probably would go to the Economic Committee, which is a
                            Committee-of-the-Whole, and, if it goes there, there probably would be
                            no question than that we would participate unless we walked out of the
                            session. If the matter is referred to a special committee, the question
                            is whether we should participate. Mr. Linder reviewed the arguments on
                            both sides of this question. He emphasized that if we refuse to
                            participate, this will provide enrollment propaganda for those who
                            oppose the U.S. In any event, we would make our position clear that even
                            if we do participate in the drafting of a blueprint, we could not
                            contribute money for the establishment of this special fund. <gloss
                                target="#t_E1">E</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UNA1">UNA</gloss>
                            have agreed that this should be our position. If the Secretary agrees,
                            it is planned that the Department would consult with Senators Sparkman
                            and Lodge, and Congressmen Vorys and Mansfield. Mr. Linder also
                            recommended that this problem be mentioned to the President and the
                            reasons given for our decision. It is likely that the Treasury
                            Department will resist any participation on our part. Mr. Linder
                            reviewed the main arguments for the Secretary in favor of participation:
                            propaganda value for our opponents, holding the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> together, and preventing a division between developed
                            and underdeveloped countries.</item>
                        <label>12.</label>
                        <item>The Secretary asked what would happen after such a blueprint was drawn
                            up and reported by the committee. Mr. Linder stated that we would make
                            it clear throughout the development of this plan that, if and when it is
                            reported to <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>, we would not
                            provide money for such a fund.</item>
                        <label>13.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Miller suggested that we, in effect, have made a basic Government
                            decision that we should participate in grant aid programs. If this is
                            the case, would it not be wise to regularize such programs through the
                            establishment of such a fund? Mr. Miller also noted that Mr.
                            Rockefeller’s report, “Partners in Progress”, proposed such a fund and
                            this proposal has been picked up recently by Congressman Javits. Mr.
                            Miller felt that there was danger in our position if we participated in
                            the development of a blueprint when, at the same time, we deny that we
                            are going to support the <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0263"
                            />establishment of such a fund. Mr. Linder stated that we can always
                            change our mind on the establishment of such a fund. He felt that we
                            could not get agreement in the Government or get the money granted from
                            the Congress to assist in establishing this fund. Mr. Miller felt that
                            if this were true, we should not participate in any way in the
                            establishment of a blueprint. He asked for a report on the status of the
                            Rockefeller Report. Mr. Linder stated that recommendations in the report
                            have apparently died, and Mr. Johnston’s approach now is that he wants
                            demonstration programs in two “typical countries”.<note n="3"

                        <item>Mr. McFall stated that it is extremely important to have consultations
                            with appropriate Senators and Congressmen on this question. He felt that
                            it might be possible at some stage to have a small program along the
                            lines suggested for such a grant fund.</item>
                        <label>15.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Linder gave further arguments in opposition to the establishment
                            of a grant fund for economic development. He pointed out that grant aid
                            should be given bilaterally and should not be given on the basis of
                            equal shares for all. It is only natural to assume that we would want to
                            control the granting of money to individual countries and the other
                            developed countries would want the same. The Secretary felt that if our
                            basic position is not to participate in the establishment of a fund, we
                            should make every effort to prevent the establishment of this fund. It
                            was pointed out that we made such efforts in the General Assembly and we
                            were defeated. We have made our position clear and would continue to do
                            so when this proposed fund is under consideration by the committee. In
                            response to a question by the Secretary, Mr. Linder stated that Mr.
                            Lubin could continue to advise the committee of our hopes for a sensible
                            plan. Mr. Hickerson restated the problem. He pointed out that the basic
                            question is whether we should decline if asked to serve on a committee
                            for the drafting of a blueprint for a grant fund. If we served, Mr.
                            Lubin would have a very minor role. It is assumed that the committee
                            would find that the establishment of a fund without US participation
                            would be unrealistic.</item>

                        <item>Dr. Compton reviewed some of his background on this problem. He
                            pointed out that Santa Cruz<note n="4" xml:id="d72fn4">Dr. Hernán Santa
                                Cruz (Chile), President of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss>

                            wanted to establish a technical assistance program coupled with a
                            capital fund. He reviewed our position in connection with this proposal.
                            With respect to the <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0264"/>problem at
                            hand, Dr. Compton felt that it would be very difficult for Mr. Lubin to
                            participate in the drafting of the blueprint if we oppose the
                            establishment of a fund. He pointed out that at one time, Mr. Vorys was
                            sympathetic to a one-third contribution for such a fund probably
                            realizing that such a fund could not be established if the US only
                            contributed one-third. In conclusion, Dr. Compton felt that if we
                            participate in the drafting of a plan, it would take on the color of a
                            “U.S. plan”.</item>
                        <label>17.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Andrews suggested that we might switch the attack toward the
                            establishment of an International Bank and Development Fund. He felt
                            that if we are going to give away money through grant aid programs, we
                            should do it ourselves. He believed that we were in an impossible
                            position on this problem. He had some question on whether we should
                            participate in the blueprinting of a fund when we were in opposition to
                            the establishment of such a fund. Mr. Linder commented on Mr. Andrews’
                            statement on the International Bank and Development Fund. He pointed out
                            that the Bank was asked by <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> for
                            its comments on a sister institution which would make loans with no
                            guarantee. The Bank has prepared a report, and it is possible that
                            Mutual Security money will be available for a contribution to the Bank
                            for such purposes. However, before this is done, we will ask the Bank to
                            draw up specific plans for such an institution. He felt that the
                            problems between the General Assembly Resolution for a grant fund and
                            the sister institution referred to by Mr. Andrews were different and
                            should be handled separately.</item>
                        <label>18.</label>
                        <item>In response to a comment by the Secretary, Mr. Linder pointed out that
                            we would make clear at every step that we would not contribute money to
                            such a fund. He stated that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> may
                            never get to the point of asking for contributions since the proposal
                            may die in committee or in <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>.
                            Mr. Andrews felt that if we are going to drag our feet on the
                            establishment of a fund, we might just as well do so at this time. The
                            Secretary was not prepared to make a decision as the result of this
                            discussion, especially in view of some differences of opinion. Mr. Bruce
                            felt that we could probably get by with the position recommended by
                                <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UNA1"
                                >UNA</gloss>. The Secretary believed that we should have free
                            consultation with the Hill before any decision is made. Mr. Nitze stated
                            that this is only a tactical question, and we are not asking Congress
                            for money. He felt that if we go to Congress for consultation, we should
                            have a definite opinion on what we believe we should do.</item>

                        <item>The Secretary concluded that our representatives should discuss the
                            problem with appropriate Senators and Congressmen, and tell them of the

                    <p>Mr. Glendinning stated that the management of the International Bank has
                        recently completed its report to <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>
                        on the proposal for an International Finance Corporation, and that the
                        report is to be considered at the coming session of <gloss
                            target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>. The Bank’s report,<note n="2"

                                <hi rend="italic">Report on the Proposal for an International

                            as <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Document E/2215, May 1,
                            1952.</note> which is framed in general terms, concludes that there is
                        an “important gap in the existing international financial machinery for
                        financing economic development” in that there is no provision in the
                        existing machinery for equity financing. The report proposes that an
                        International Finance Corporation would make equity investments and loans
                        not guaranteed by governments, and suggest that the financing techniques
                        might cover the entire range of securities, including straight bonds and
                        preferred shares of stock. The report indicates that the extent to which
                        such a Corporation would succeed in generating a flow of private equity
                        capital can be determined only by experience. The Bank’s management feels,
                        however, that an International Finance Corporation would probably be able to
                        stimulate the growth of private enterprise.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Glendinning observed that the United States Government will be expected
                        to take a position on the Bank’s report in the <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                            >ECOSOC</gloss> meetings, and that the paper under consideration (<gloss

                        summary, the draft position paper recommends that the United States delegate
                        should welcome the report of the Bank and that the delegate should state
                        that the U.S. welcomes a full discussion of the proposal. The Staff
                        Committee felt that there will be pressure in <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                            >ECOSOC</gloss> for further development of the proposal, and wanted to
                        make sure that such further study would be done in the International Bank
                        rather than in <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>. The recommended
                        position would instruct the U.S. delegate to take a position along these
                        lines.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Glendinning called attention to the alternative language in the position
                        paper, requesting the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> either to “draft

                        recommended the adoption of the following language:</p>
                    <p>“The United States Delegate should: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <list>

                                    Bank are also interested, so as to assure that there would be an
                                    adequate initial capital and a reasonably extended area of
                                    operations to warrant further exploration of the proposal,
                                    and</item>
                                <item>“2) Recommend that if these conditions are met, <gloss

                            </list></quote></p>
                    <p>Mr. Glendinning continued that the representative of the Securities and
                        Exchange Commission on the Staff Committee had submitted this language with
                        the approval of the Commission. The two alternatives in the position paper
                        were submitted by the rest of the members of the Staff Committee. Thus, the
                        question is whether to adopt the <gloss target="#t_SEC1">SEC</gloss>
                        language or one of the two alternatives in the draft paper.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Thorp remarked that State Department’s primary concern is in getting this
                        proposal into the International Bank, on the ostensible grounds that in the
                        field of finance the Bank’s Board is much more competent than the political
                        representatives in <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> and the General
                        Assembly. In adopting such a position in <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                            >ECOSOC</gloss>, the U.S. delegate should not refer to the differences
                        in voting arrangements as between the Bank and <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                            >ECOSOC</gloss>, but should argue that because this is a technical
                        problem the Bank is the proper place to consider it.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the <gloss target="#t_SEC1">SEC</gloss> proposal, Mr. Thorp
                        commented that he didn’t disagree with the first paragraph. However, he was
                        concerned by the specific instruction that the <gloss target="#t_IFC1"
                            >IFC</gloss> charter should come before the Board of Governors of the
                        Bank in September. He questioned the desirability of saying that the Board
                        of Governors should discuss the matter in September. The language in the
                        position paper, “at an early date,” appeared to be preferable.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman agreed it would be expecting too much to require a charter to be
                        completed by September, because setting up an international financial
                        organization isn’t done overnight.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cleveland said that the position paper is a good one, and the <gloss
                            target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> believes the U.S. Government should go this
                        far in supporting further exploration of the matter. He saw little
                        difference in the language of the three alternatives.</p>
                    <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0268"/>
                    <p>Mr. Cleveland indicated that it might be interesting at this time to
                        summarize the Congressional situation as a result of the adoption of
                        Congressman Javits’<note n="5" xml:id="d73fn5">Jacob K. Javits (<gloss

                        Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives.<note n="6" xml:id="d73fn6"
                            >Javits’ proposal was in the form of an amendment entitled
                            “International Finance Corporation” to <gloss target="#t_HR1"
                                >H.R.</gloss> 7005, which became the Mutual Security Act of 1952 (66
                            Stat. 141). This section provided that up to $100 million of the funds
                            allocated for military, economic, or technical assistance could be used
                            for the purpose of subscribing to the capital of an <gloss
                                target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss>. This amendment was not approved by the
                            Senate and was subsequently deleted in the conference report (H. Report
                            2031). It was thus not included in the final bill passed on May 23,
                            1952.</note> There have been consultations with Mr. Javits within the
                        last few days with the objective of making the language of his amendment
                        more flexible. The two changes under discussion were (1) to add the words
                        “to stimulate economic development” to the purposes of the amendment, and
                        (2) to delete the specific reference to the International Finance
                        Corporation as an affiliate of the International Bank and to substitute the
                        words “any international financing organization created to further the
                        objectives of this section.” This second change would be necessary, he
                        explained, in case the organization is not called the “International Finance
                        Corporation”. It also makes possible the consideration of regional financial
                        organizations of the same character. Mr. Cleveland added that these two
                        changes appear to be satisfactory to Mr. Javits. The amendment makes $100
                        million available on a permissive “not to exceed” basis. It was generally
                        agreed in the executive branch that no objection would be raised to the
                        amendment in this form.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schneider called attention to the fact that the reactions of business and
                        investment communities on the prospects of success of the proposed
                        corporation were not uniform. He quoted from the Bank’s report: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“There was substantial difference of opinions, but it was the view of
                                a considerable, probably the preponderant, group that there was good
                                reason to believe that private investors would be interested in
                                availing themselves of the facilities of the Corporation, and that
                                the Corporation should prove an effective inducement to additional
                                private investment in the underdeveloped areas.</p>
                            <p>“Among another group the proposal met with complete disfavor. This
                                outright opposition was generally founded on the belief that public
                                funds should not be used for equity investment in private
                                enterprises. Many in this group expressed the view that, where the
                                climate for investment is favorable, ample private funds will be
                                forthcoming. In their opinion, where the climate is not favorable,
                                neither public nor private monies should be invested. Others thought
                                the proposal inherently unworkable; they believed that the public
                                character of the Corporation would be incompatible with
                                participation in private undertakings.”</p></quote></p>
                    <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0269"/>
                    <p>Mr. Schneider noted that these opinions resulted from an informal survey of
                        members of the investment communities in Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, the
                        Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. He said
                        the Secretary of Commerce and he both agree with the unfavorable view, since
                        nothing has been shown that warrants the establishment of an International
                        Finance Corporation. However, he added that additional opinions from other
                        investment communities could possibly alter the position of the Commerce
                        Department.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gaston was in full agreement with the views expressed by Mr. Schneider.
                        He remarked that he had no reason to suppose that creation of a special fund
                        of this kind, whether or not relying wholly on U.S. funds, would stimulate
                        private investment in other countries. He pointed out that the Bretton Woods
                            Agreement<note n="7" xml:id="d73fn7">In July 1944, the major nations of

                            constant exchange rate for international currencies. Both the
                            International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for

                        thought it premature to say that this charter and this scope of action is
                        not going to be sufficient to meet the problems of international lending.
                        Mr. Gaston thought it was strange that the International Bank would want to
                        consider this matter, since it would involve the creation of a different
                        sort of institution to make equity and unguaranteed investments—something
                        the International Bank has not been empowered to do itself.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Martin said he concurred entirely with the views of Mr. Gaston and Mr.
                        Schneider on this matter. The United States has been hearing about this type
                        of investment for five or six years, he commented, but he had seen nothing
                        concrete to support the idea.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman then brought the discussion back to the disposition of the
                        position paper. He asked if the Council should follow the course suggested
                        by Mr. Thorp and favor referring the matter to the Board of Governors of the
                        International Bank.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Thorp observed that the problem is a strategic one. The State Department
                        is not prepared to favor the establishment of an International Finance
                        Corporation, but it has to deal with the fact the <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                            >ECOSOC</gloss> will be considering the Bank’s report. <gloss
                            target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> will also be considering the proposal
                        for an international grant authority. The State Department intends to take a
                        firm position against the proposed international grant authority. There is
                        divided opinion on the <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> proposal,
                        however, and accordingly it was thought <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244"
                            facs="0270"/>desirable to have this matter considered further by the
                        International Bank. State does not want the proposal considered further in
                            <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Thorp thought it possible that an <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss>
                        might be successful. For example, there may be situations in which private
                        investors would be interested, but not to the extent of providing all the
                        capital. The marginal capital could be provided by this Corporation. If the
                        plan works, he added, that would be fine; if not, there would be no harm
                        done.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gaston commented that the dollars would then be lost. Mr. Thorp
                        disagreed, saying that if the idea did not work, the corporation would be
                        liquidated. The Chairman observed that it has not been the practice to
                        return money once it has been appropriated. Mr. Gaston continued that he
                        believed the Council should express firm opposition to the Javits amendment
                        to the Mutual Security bill, and should also express the opinion to <gloss
                            target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> that, after due consideration, the
                        Council does not believe it feasible to establish an <gloss target="#t_IFC1"
                            >IFC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schneider concurred with this view, but thought there might be a more
                        diplomatic way of expressing the position. He felt, however, that it should
                        be made clear to the United Nations that up to this time the Council has
                        serious doubts about the proposal. Mr. Thorp pointed out that the position
                        paper raises a number of critical questions which would be best dealt with
                        in the International Bank.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Overby noted that in the informal discussions of the problem in the Bank,
                        the United States had sounded all the notes of caution that should be
                        sounded, including the question of whether the proposed corporation would
                        encourage or discourage private investment. A whole series of questions was
                        raised, he continued, but the United States was the only country to voice
                        them. The management was not swayed much by the questions. The report was
                        made by the management of the Bank and has not been approved by the
                        Executive Directors. Mr. Overby also remarked that he had testified on the
                            <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> proposal before the House Foreign
                        Affairs Committee, but had been unable to persuade Mr. Javits to omit this
                        proposal from the bill. Since he had been unsuccessful both in the Bank and
                        before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Overby believed the Council
                        should take a stronger position than the one in the present position paper,
                        if the Council does not intend ultimately to favor the proposal.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gaston believed that the tone of the paper was strongly favorable toward
                        the <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> proposal.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schneider recalled that the Mutual Security bill before the House
                        requires <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_TCA1"
                            >TCA</gloss>, the Commerce Department and the <pb n="245"
                            xml:id="pg_245" facs="0271"/>State Department to develop a program for
                        the encouragement of private investment abroad. These agencies have already
                        started on this program. Mr. Schneider did not believe the Government should
                        consider the proposed corporation unless the program fails.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman asked what position Mr. Schneider would take if the bill is
                        passed by the House and the Senate, including the Javits amendment. Mr.
                        Schneider answered that the executive branch should take a position now in
                        opposition to the corporation. Mr. Martin agreed, and said that the Council
                        should not attempt to postpone the issue.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cleveland observed that there really are two different issues here, which
                        are partly a matter of tactics. The tactics proposed by the Staff Committee
                        with respect to the problem in <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> is
                        to keep the matter from being decided in <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                            >ECOSOC</gloss> by having it referred to the International Bank, where
                        it can be discussed as a technical problem. <gloss target="#t_MSA1"
                            >MSA</gloss> favors these tactics regardless of the eventual position of
                        the executive branch on the proposal. U.S. opposition to the proposal in
                            <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> would induce a wave of
                        sentiment there to refer the matter to the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >U.N.</gloss> General Assembly, which would fit in with the desires and
                        aspirations of the underdeveloped areas. Mr. Cleveland felt that regardless
                        of the eventual U.S. attitude on the proposal for an International Finance
                        Corporation, getting the matter out of <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                            >ECOSOC</gloss> should be a primary concern of the Council.</p>
                    <p>There is another problem, Mr. Cleveland continued, on the Congressional side.
                        The proposal for an <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> is only one of a
                        number of amendments to the Mutual Security bill. Mr. Wood<note n="8"
                            xml:id="d73fn8">Presumably C. Tyler Wood, Associate Deputy Director of
                            the Mutual Security Agency.</note> feels strongly that the
                        Administration will be better off the fewer the amendments that are opposed.
                        Since this particular amendment is permissive, <gloss target="#t_MSA1"
                            >MSA</gloss> believes it would do no harm. No one contemplates that in
                        fiscal 1952 the Administration would transfer $100 million of aid from one
                        place to another. For this reason, <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>
                        believes that the best tactics would be to refrain from opposing the
                        amendment.</p>
                    <p>There is another strong tactical reason for not making a major issue of this
                        matter in Congress this year, Mr. Cleveland added. Since it is not really
                        known whether an <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> would be a sensible and
                        useful arrangement to fill an apparent gap in international financing and
                        development, it is worthwhile to give the International Bank an opportunity
                        to work the proposal out more completely. For this reason he felt that the
                        Council should reserve its position on the merits of the proposal until it
                        has a specific plan before it.</p>
                    <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0272"/>
                    <p>Mr. Gaston expressed doubt as to the tactical wisdom of refraining from
                        opposing an unacceptable proposal. If a request for equity financing is a
                        good business proposition, it will be financed, if it is a bad business
                        proposition, it will not be financed. The reason why private foreign
                        investment is not larger is not the failure of foreign countries and
                        international organizations to subscribe to equity capital, but is to be
                        found in a great many obstacles relating to military and political
                        situations and to commercial policies of foreign countries which deter
                        private capital from making equity investment. Both the Export-Import Bank
                        and the International Bank now encourage equity investment abroad, Mr.
                        Gaston continued, because when a loan is made for a project, the investor
                        has a certain amount of protection due to the participation of these two
                        organizations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Thorp observed that those are certainly strong arguments on this matter,
                        and he saw no reason why any number of questions on the <gloss
                            target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> proposal should not be raised in <gloss
                            target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>. However, in view of the problem of
                        the political relationship of the United States with the underdeveloped
                        countries, he believed the proposal would be considered better in the
                        International Bank than in <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>. If the
                        United States goes into the <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>
                        meetings and declares itself flatly against the proposal, then it will be
                        referred to the United Nations rather than to the Bank. The proposal will
                        then be voted upon favorably in the General Assembly, which would put the
                        United States in a continuously embarrassing position. Despite U.S.
                        opposition, he explained, the United Nations can establish an institution
                        that will be a thorn in the side of the United States, because people will
                        want to know why this country is not interested in the institution.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Thorp reminded the Council that <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>
                        is under instructions from the General Assembly to develop a plan for an
                            <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss>. The Chairman pointed out that if
                        the proposal could be moved into another agency, the United States would not
                        have jeopardized its ultimate position.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gaston expressed the view that the Council should prepare a position
                        paper indicating very strong doubt that there is anything of value in the
                        proposal. He believed the same representation should also be made to
                        Congress. Since the United States was asked by <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                            >ECOSOC</gloss> to take a position on the proposal, Mr. Gaston did not
                        see why it should refer a statement of its position back to the
                        International Bank. The Chairman pointed out that the attempt would be to
                        have the proposal referred by <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> to
                        the International Bank, after which the United States could take its
                        position in the Bank. Mr. Overby agreed with Mr. Gaston that the position
                        paper under consideration takes a favorable attitude <pb n="247"
                            xml:id="pg_247" facs="0273"/>toward the proposal; but he also favored
                        the idea of moving consideration from <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                            >ECOSOC</gloss> to the Bank.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Thorp believed that the U.S. delegate should raise questions in <gloss
                            target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> on those aspects of the proposal of
                        concern to the United States, but should not take too strong a position
                        against the proposal for fear of failing to get it into the Board of
                        Governors. He then suggested that it would be a good idea to have a working
                        party redraft the position paper in light of the present discussion. Mr.
                        Martin agreed, provided the ultimate objective was to kill the whole
                        project.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Thorp commented that the State Department was not prepared at this time
                        to take a strong position either for or against the proposal, but wanted to
                        see a more detailed proposal before taking any position.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman suggested that a working party revise the position paper for
                        resubmission to the Council. In the meantime, he advised the Council members
                        to give the matter considerable thought because of its extreme
                        importance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Overby questioned the advisability of the <gloss target="#t_MSA1"
                            >MSA</gloss> proposal to change the Javits amendment by generalizing the
                        reference to the <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss>. Mr. Cleveland replied
                        that the main purpose of the change of language was to avoid Congressional
                        sanction of the proposal in advance of the <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                            >ECOSOC</gloss> meeting, so as not to tie the hands of the United States
                        in <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>. Mr. Cleveland pointed out that
                        at the moment, the Council’s record with respect to the Javits amendment
                        consists of the non-committal letter sent by the Chairman to Mr. Javits. If
                        the Council intends to get Mr. Javits to take his amendment out of the bill,
                        a question of tactics needs to be considered.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cleveland hoped it would not be recorded that there is a consensus of
                        vigorous opposition to the <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> proposal in
                        the Council. He said the <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> position is
                        similar to that of the State Department.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schneider questioned whether the Council should take any position with
                        respect to the legislative proposal. Mr. Cleveland advised the Council that
                        Mr. Harriman had told Mr. Javits that this was the kind of question under
                        the jurisdiction of the Council, and that he would refer it to the Chairman
                        of the Council. The Chairman then wrote to Mr. Javits saying the
                        administration was interested in exploring the proposal but had taken no
                        firm position on the matter. Mr. Cleveland concluded that there is a
                        question now of whether the tone and substance of the letter to Mr Javits
                        should be changed during the present session of Congress.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Thorp commented that if the proposed amendment goes through in its
                        present form, the U.S. position in <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>
                        would be <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0274"/>intolerable. The Chairman
                        observed that if the amendment is passed by the Congress, the Council would
                        be forced to take a firm position. Mr. Cleveland pointed out that the
                        amendment is not contained in the Senate bill at the moment, but he thought
                        Mr. Javits would try to have it introduced on the Senate floor.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman concluded that the Staff Committee should take another look at
                        the problem, after which the Council would consider it again.</p>

                    <p>There follows a brief summary of some of the current problems which affect
                        the conduct of the Point 4 program.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">1. Program Scope and Philosophy</hi></p>
                    <p>One of the major unsolved problems of the Point 4 program is the need for a
                        clear definition of its scope and philosophy in relation to other United
                        States foreign assistance activities. <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>
                        continues to favor relatively restricted programs centering around the
                        supply of technical services, directly related supplies and materials, and
                        the training of foreign nationals, with major emphasis in the fields of
                        agriculture, health and education. <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> has
                        also stressed the desirability of a gradual, long-range approach, although
                        it is willing to undertake an accelerated program of this same general type
                        in more critical areas such as the Near East and South Asia. Finally, <gloss
                            target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> has laid great stress on the non-military,
                        constructive and humanitarian nature of the Point 4 program as contrasted
                        with defense related economic assistance.</p>
                    <p>This concept was publicized by Dr. Bennett<note n="3" xml:id="d74fn3">Henry
                            G. Bennett became the first Administrator of the Technical Cooperation
                            Administration on Dec. 1, 1950. For an expression of his views, see “The
                            Engineer and Point Four,” Department of State <hi rend="italic"

                        success and its relatively low cost and “shirt sleeve” approach have
                        undoubtedly <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0275"/>contributed greatly to
                        the substantial support manifested for Point 4 by Congressional and private
                        groups which have been lukewarm or cool toward other elements of our
                        national program for mutual security, particularly defense-supporting
                        economic aid. One indication of Congressional feeling on this point was the
                        recent action of the House in restricting the materials component of Point 4
                        programs to not more than three times the technical services component, and
                        in cutting in half the non-defense supporting portion of the
                        Administration’s economic aid recommendation for Southeast Asia. (The
                        restriction was removed in conference, and the cut partially restored.)</p>
                    <p>In spite of its undoubted political and popular appeal, this definition of
                        Point 4 raises several very serious problems. In the first place, the stress
                        laid on the non-military nature of Point 4 makes it more difficult to
                        achieve adequate coordination with other elements of our total security
                        program such as the development of vital materials abroad, and the
                        gradualist emphasis creates problems of timing in relation to more immediate
                        defense and political goals involved in the short range timetable for
                        strengthening the free world.</p>
                    <p>In the second place, some of the arguments and efforts used in support of
                        this Point 4 concept have played into the hands of those who were
                        unsympathetic to the Administration’s proposals for <gloss target="#t_MSA1"
                            >MSA</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> economic assistance, so
                        that the Executive Branch as a whole has been working to some extent at
                        cross-purposes.</p>
                    <p>Thirdly, and perhaps most important, the present Point 4 concept, by
                        definition, excludes relief activities, capital goods in any appreciable
                        volume, and current supply and consumers’ goods in general. Therefore, it
                        leaves unanswered the problem of what to do when any of these purposes are
                        considered to be necessary in the United States interest to cope with
                        particular problems in those areas of the world where conditions are
                        critical but defense ties with the United States are not close enough to
                        justify a defense-supporting economic aid program under <gloss
                            target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> authority. This dilemma has been answered
                        in the case of the Palestine refugees by using the United Nations as the
                        vehicle, and in the case of Israel, by special legislative authorization for
                        a United States aid program. <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> has
                        attempted to explain the proposed programs for India, Pakistan and Iran as
                        exceptions to the general philosophy, but this has only served to make them
                        vulnerable, as evidenced by the House action mentioned above. This same
                        problem lies at the root of the controversy with respect to Ambassador
                            Locke’s<note n="4" xml:id="d74fn4">Edwin Allen Locke, Jr. was assigned

                    <p>This situation forces the United States to fall back on one of three
                        alternatives, none of which are really satisfactory from the standpoint of
                        total national interest: <list>
                            <label>(a)</label>
                            <item>to have only a technical assistance program, even though political
                                realities indicate the need for something more;</item>
                            <label>(b)</label>
                            <item>to have two programs under two different administrative agencies,
                                leading to possible confusion and rivalry in the field and double
                                sets of country relations; and</item>
                            <label>(c)</label>
                            <item>to have two programs with different legislative authorizations but
                                administered by the same agency, <gloss target="#t_TCA1"
                                >TCA</gloss>, which would be understandably confusing to the local
                                governments and leaves the larger scale program vulnerable to the
                                sort of Congressional attack which has just taken place.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>The fourth and most logical alternative is ruled out under the present Point
                        4 concept and philosophy. That would be to use the Act for International
                            Development<note n="5" xml:id="d74fn5">Title IV of the Foreign Economic
                            Assistance Act of 1950 (Public Law 535), enacted June 5, 1950; for text,
                            see 64 Stat. 204.</note> (with amendments if necessary) as the basic
                        vehicle for United States aid programs in underdeveloped areas, with a scope
                        broad enough to embrace whatever needs to be done in our interests in those
                        areas, and with the content of each country program to be determined each
                        year by Administrative and Congressional action on the basis of the actual
                        needs and urgencies rather than by application of automatically limiting
                        criteria.</p>
                    <p>Another aspect of this same general problem is the lack of emphasis in <gloss
                            target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> on the investment and capital phases of
                        economic development. While there is a Special Assistant to the <gloss
                            target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> Administrator concerned with this problem,
                        it has not been given adequate attention, nor is it much in evidence in
                        country planning. A logical corollary of greater emphasis on the investment
                        aspect of economic development would be closer ties between <gloss
                            target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> and public lending sources such as the
                        Export-Import Bank and the International Bank. This whole matter of the
                        encouragement of developmental capital, particularly through private
                        investment, is one in which the chairman of the International Development
                        Advisory Board, Mr. Eric Johnston, is especially interested.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. Program Execution</hi></p>
                    <p>Another major problem which confronts <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> is
                        the necessity for setting up the basic mechanics and processes to insure
                        that after country programs have been approved, work actually gets underway
                            <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0277"/>and progresses as speedily as
                        the urgency of the situation demands and local conditions will permit. This
                        really boils down to four things: defining specific responsibilities for
                        action here and in the field; devising and instituting the necessary
                        processes for project authorization, issuance of funds, recruitment and
                        assignment of technician personnel, procurement and shipment of supplies and
                        selection of trainees; working out the precise form and nature of
                        cooperative institutions or dealings with host governments; and securing
                        timely information and checks on program progress through a program
                        reporting system.</p>
                    <p>While a good deal has been achieved in the last few months along all these
                        lines, it has been through a large number of spot decisions by individual
                        program officials, and there has been a general lack of systematic
                        procedures, uniformly understood and applied—a lack particularly felt in the
                        field. This has been due primarily to the lack of any central impetus on
                        these points, in the absence of an Administrator and without a clearly
                        defined central responsibility for these matters under an Assistant
                        Administrator for Management. Both these posts have now been filled and
                        intensive work is progressing on all of these fronts, with priority emphasis
                        on information and instructions needed by people in the field. Three members
                        of the Management Staff are working full time with <gloss target="#t_TCA1"
                            >TCA</gloss> on this project.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">3. <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>
                            Relationships Within State Department</hi></p>
                    <p>Under the general plan of reorganization approved last Fall, it was intended
                        that <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> should function within the State
                        Department as a semi-autonomous, straight line entity with full
                        responsibility for program operational matters, with specific ties to the
                        regional bureaus and, as appropriate, to other Department units for policy
                        guidance and program review, and drawing on the Department’s administrative
                        facilities for administrative services to the extent that those facilities
                        could effectively serve their program needs. The broad lines of this
                        relationship are by now quite well understood in <gloss target="#t_TCA1"
                            >TCA</gloss> and throughout the rest of the Department, but the specific
                        application has occasioned considerable controversy and is not fully defined
                        in all respects. The regional bureaus, particularly <gloss target="#t_ARA1"
                            >ARA</gloss>, have tended to interest themselves and get into
                        operational and administrative matters as well as their primary policy role.
                        As mentioned above, <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> have had a major difference of opinion on
                        policy itself in the Near East. <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> has
                        sometimes leaned toward separatism to an unnecessary extent and has not
                        always kept appropriate Department units informed of its actions and
                        proposals. The administrative sections of the Department have been slow to
                        grasp the extent to which the administrative <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252"
                            facs="0278"/>needs and requirements for the Point 4 program on such
                        matters as budget and accounting, personnel administration, and procurement,
                        require different policies and methods than those appropriate for other
                        Departmental activities. A succession of incumbents in the position of
                        Special Assistant for Mutual Security Affairs has delayed the working out of
                        a mutual understanding as to the Special Assistant’s responsibilities with
                        respect to the Point 4 program.</p>
                    <p>With the exception of the <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>–<gloss
                            target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> policy disagreement, most of these
                        differences have been resolved or are nearing solution. There will, however,
                        be a continuing necessity to restrain the <gloss target="#t_TCA1"
                            >TCA</gloss> centrifugal tendency and the restrictionist tendencies in
                        the rest of the Department. This is as much or more a matter of attitudes
                        and mutual understanding than of specific directives or organizational
                        arrangements. Mr. Andrews appears very cooperative and understanding on
                        these as on most other relationship problems affecting <gloss

                    <p>There has been very considerable misunderstanding and confusion in the field
                        as to the respective responsibilities and relationships of Point 4 Country
                        Directors, Chiefs of Mission and other sections of the diplomatic mission.
                        Essentially the problem has been to find workable middle ground between two
                        extremes—one in which the Chief of Mission displayed relative indifference
                        to the Point 4 program, did not give it active and vigorous support and
                        treated the Country Director and Point 4 personnel as though their
                        activities were remote from his responsibilities; and the other in which the
                        Chief of Mission and other mission officials concerned themselves not only
                        with major policy issues but extensively with operational and administrative
                        details to an extent which seriously hampered the Country Director in
                        executing his assigned functions.</p>
                    <p>To a large extent these difficulties seem to be traceable to misunderstanding
                        stemming from lack of a clear Departmental directive specifying
                        responsibilities and relationships desired. All concerned are in agreement
                        that such a directive is badly needed; a draft instruction for this purpose
                        has been drawn up in <gloss target="#t_AMS1">A/MS</gloss> and is presently
                        being cleared by the units concerned, principally <gloss target="#t_TCA1"
                            >TCA</gloss> and the regional bureaus.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">5. The Institute of Inter-American
                            Affairs</hi></p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_IIAA1">IIAA</gloss>, a government corporation which has
                        for ten years administered a program similar to Point 4 in Latin America,
                        was brought into the Point 4 program by the Act for International
                        Development and was intended under the reorganization of last Fall to become
                        an integral part of <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> as its regional
                        service for Latin <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0279"/>America. Although
                        the <gloss target="#t_IIAA1">IIAA</gloss> is housed in the <gloss
                            target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> building and submits its programs to the
                            <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> Administrator for approval, the
                        degree of integration actually achieved thus far is not great. It retains
                        its separate administrative services, different procedures and sets of field
                        instructions, and its own communication series. It has, however, instituted
                        Country Directors to provide field integration for the several functional
                        field parties which formerly reported individually directly to Washington.
                        It has also moved, at the Washington level, to set up a program office to
                        provide a more integrated regional approach. Finally, some <gloss
                            target="#t_IIAA1">IIAA</gloss> people have moved to equivalent positions
                        in <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>, thus providing a personal linkage at
                        those points.</p>
                    <p>There are two principal reasons why integration has not progressed further:
                        First, the embryonic condition of the <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>
                        organization and administrative structure and its much greater dependence on
                        the central State Department administrative facilities, which caused the
                            <gloss target="#t_IIAA1">IIAA</gloss> to feel that the efficiency of its
                        operations would be lessened by an actual merger of functions; and Second, a
                        deliberate desire on the part of the President and Vice President of the
                            <gloss target="#t_IIAA1">IIAA</gloss> to keep the Institute’s operations
                        self-contained and separate as far as possible as a matter of principle. At
                        the same time, <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>, lacking a permanent head
                        until recently, was unwilling to press the issue.</p>
                    <p>While a greater measure of integration is desirable and should be sought, the
                        fact remains that the Point 4 program in Latin America is in being and
                        moving along, whereas it is barely started in other areas. Therefore, it
                        seems undesirable to waste much time and effort of key people on pressing
                        for rapid and complete integration of <gloss target="#t_IIAA1">IIAA</gloss>
                        into <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> with the possible risk of
                        disrupting a going program, when the main and most critical job should
                        require the pressing attention of <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>
                        officials. There are certain specific points where <gloss target="#t_IIAA1"
                            >IIAA</gloss> practices and instructions need to be brought closer into
                        line, such as communication practices and field relations of their Country
                        Directors and field party chiefs to Chiefs of Mission. Mr. Andrews is aware
                        of this problem, which is primarily an internal one for <gloss
                            target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>, and he should prove capable of handling
                        it.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">6. Participating Government
                        Agencies</hi></p>
                    <p>Another Point 4 problem which has yet to be fully resolved is the appropriate
                        role of the other government agencies participating in the
                        program—Departments of Agriculture, Interior, Commerce, Federal Security
                        Agency, etc. Under the original plan of administration, these agencies were
                        actually delegated responsibilities for particular functional segments of
                        the program—agriculture, health, education, etc. <gloss target="#t_TCA1"
                            >TCA</gloss> allotted them funds and they then employed <pb n="254"
                            xml:id="pg_254" facs="0280"/>personnel, sent them out to the field,
                        administered projects, received reports, etc. In practice this has not been
                        satisfactory for two main reasons: First, because it resulted in a series of
                        unrelated functional projects rather than a truly integrated country
                        program; and Secondly, because the participating agencies insisted on
                        performing the administrative support for these field projects in their
                        Washington headquarters—handling of payroll, purchase requisitions, travel,
                        etc. so that the technicians in the field lacked any definite knowledge as
                        to, just what the program budget was, where it stood, and the status of
                        their supply requisitions, personnel actions, etc.</p>
                    <p>Because of this, one of the aims of the reorganization last Fall was to
                        centralize authority over all aspects of the program more fully in the
                            <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> Administrator, with the
                        participating agencies acting as <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> agents
                        for specific matters such as the recruitment of technicians or the
                        processing of foreign trainees. The negotiation of these changes presented
                        tactical problems which Dr. Bennett wished to handle in his own way and on
                        which he was making considerable headway at the time of his death. However,
                        a marked change of attitudes then ensued in the participating agencies, and
                        little further progress has been made in really achieving a significantly
                        tighter central control at the Washington level. There has been a formal
                        redefinition of agency responsibilities but it does not constitute a great
                        change from the previous picture.</p>
                    <p>The real test of this matter, however, lies in the field; the creation of the
                        post of Country Director cannot help but go a long way toward a unified
                        program administration, provided the agencies do not try to keep their
                        people out from under his control. The best real hope for progress along
                        this line, therefore, lies at present in strengthening the hand of Country
                        Directors in the field rather than attempting further reshuffling of
                        responsibilities in Washington. This is especially true because the new
                        Administrator, Mr. Andrews, having previously been active in the program as
                        a representative of one participating agency, the Department of Agriculture,
                        is naturally not wholly convinced of the need of any greater centralization
                        at the Washington level.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>At one point in the discussion of the International Finance Corporation
                        position paper in the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Staff Committee,
                        Mr. Bell of the <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss> mentioned
                        that such an institution might have certain harmful effects—although he did
                        not mention them. In the course of a telephone conversation some days later
                        I asked him to explain his comment. He did so by mentioning that the Bank
                        had been troubled by the point frequently made in discussion that nothing
                        would be lost by experimenting with an <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss>.
                        The Bank disagrees with this line of argument, largely because of the
                        possible harmful effects which Mr. Bell outlined as follows: <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>In the opinion of the <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1"
                                    >Eximbank</gloss> the <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> will
                                not accomplish the objective of stimulating an increased flow of
                                private capital to underdeveloped areas. Therefore, the
                                establishment of an <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> cannot help
                                but result eventually in disappointment and disillusionment on the
                                part of those countries which would look to it for great things. To
                                set up an international institution with this as a likely result is
                                definitely harmful—presumably it would discredit international
                                action in the financial field, to say nothing of the waste motion
                                involved in establishing an <gloss target="#t_IFC1"
                                >IFC</gloss>.</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>The existence of an <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> might
                                actually reduce the amount of private capital invested abroad. If
                                capital is available from an <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> it
                                may impair the incentive for private entrepreneurs to seek the
                                additional capital they need from private sources. The <gloss
                                    target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss>’s feeling in this
                                regard is strengthened by its observation that in a great many cases
                                (if not most) where it refused to participate in financing projects
                                presented to it by private individuals and firms, the needed capital
                                was secured elsewhere and the projects went forward despite the
                                Bank’s non-participation. Hence had the Bank participated less
                                private capital would have been used.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>On the latter point I said that, in my opinion, if the <gloss
                            target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> was to be merely another banking
                        institution I thought that Mr. Bell’s argument had some force. However, I
                        added that my own favorable reaction toward the <gloss target="#t_IFC1"
                            >IFC</gloss> idea was based on the assumption that it would undertake
                        rather extensive promotional work; for example, in finding and developing
                        opportunities for profitable investment in which it would actively endeavor
                        to interest private investors—with the carrot of some financial
                        participation if necessary. Mr. Bell <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0282"
                        />then queried whether there aren’t a number of private investing firms
                        which undertake to bring projects and capital together, and wondered whether
                        an <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> would be able to do a great deal more
                        than that. This is obviously something that will have to be explored when we
                        eventually come to grips with the merits of an <gloss target="#t_IFC1"
                            >IFC</gloss>, although I rather suspect that private activity of this
                        kind is confined to the more developed areas.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bell again deplored the fact that there had been no discussion whatsoever

                    </list>
                    <p>This memorandum is with reference to your query as to our attitude regarding
                        the extension of assistance by the U.S. government for the development of
                        industries abroad which might compete with American industries either in the
                        U.S. market or in foreign markets.</p>
                    <p>As I indicated to you in our discussion of the problem last week, in our view
                        we should not, as a general matter, refuse to give developmental assistance
                        to a foreign industry merely because such an industry might compete with a
                        U.S. industry. In our judgment a decision to assist the development of a
                        foreign industry should be based primarily on whether the industry in
                        question is an economic one or not, that is whether in the light of the
                        resources available in the particular country the industry shows promise,
                        once it has been given some initial assistance, of being able to stand on
                        its own feet and compete against products from other sources of supply
                        without artificial means of support. If the development of such an industry
                        results in increased competition for American firms, that competition will
                        simply have to be accepted as incident to the process of development. In
                        fact, in view of the great diversification of <pb n="257" xml:id="pg_257"
                            facs="0283"/>the American economy we must anticipate that manufacturing
                        industries abroad are highly likely to be either directly or indirectly
                        competitive with some U.S. industry.</p>
                    <p>In any particular case considerations other than those indicated above may
                        have to be taken into account in determining whether to grant assistance to
                        a competitive foreign industry. We would not be so unrealistic as to
                        suggest, for example, that assistance be given in a particular case if it
                        would result in such acute domestic pressures as to jeopardize one aspect or
                        another of the U.S. Government’s developmental program. Such cases will have
                        to be examined individually and a judgment made as to what the appropriate
                        course of action should be.</p>
                    <p>In support of the general thesis that developmental assistance should be
                        given to foreign industries so long as they are economical even though such
                        industries may compete with U.S. industries, I should like to call your
                        attention to Section 403 of the <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>
                            Act.<note n="3" xml:id="d76fn3">Title IV of the Foreign Economic
                            Assistance Act of 1950 entitled “Act for International
                            Development.”</note> That Section provides that the test for the
                        suitability of granting developmental assistance shall be “whether the
                        assistance applied for is an appropriate part of a program reasonably
                        designed to contribute to the balanced and integrated development of the
                        country or area concerned.” This test does not contain any injunction
                        against assisting industries which compete with American firms. In fact, it
                        to some extent implies the opposite since, in view of the highly diversified
                        character of the United States economically as noted above, it would be
                        extremely difficult to develop a program which would assure a “balanced and
                        integrated development of the country or area concerned” without stimulating
                        to some degree competition with American industry.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I should like to emphasize again one aspect of the problem which we
                        discussed in my office, namely that we should avoid giving assistance to
                        foreign industries which will be unable to maintain themselves on a long run
                        basis without some form of artificial protection such as quotas, tariffs, or
                        other restrictive devices. Assistance in such cases is not only undesirable
                        for the obvious reason that it conflicts with this government’s efforts to
                        reduce the barriers to trade and to achieve a more economical and productive
                        use of resources. It is also undesirable because it will create domestic
                        criticism of, and will impair domestic support for, this government’s
                        policies and programs in the fields of trade, finance and economic
                        development. We have already been subject to considerable criticism because
                        of the extensive restrictions, largely stemming from balance-of-payments
                        difficulties, which American businessmen <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258"
                            facs="0284"/>have encountered abroad. This criticism is bound to be
                        intensified, and properly so in my judgment, if we give assistance to an
                        uneconomical industry and then find ourselves faced with various types of
                        restrictions against imports from the United States and elsewhere in order
                        to protect the industry in question.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>I said to you the other day that several major policy problems in the Point 4
                        Program are likely to come to a head within the next few months, and that
                        some of these will certainly reach your desk and Mr. Phleger’s. You
                        suggested that I give you a memorandum listing these problems and discussing
                        each briefly. I shall be glad to discuss any of these in greater detail with
                        you and Mr. Phleger whenever you wish.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">1. Size of Grant Component in Point 4
                            Programs.</hi></p>
                    <p>Ever since enactment of the Act for International Development in June 1950,
                        there has been a controversy, within the Executive Branch, in Congress and
                        among the public, over the size of the grants (in the form of machinery,
                        equipment and supplies) that should be included in Point 4 programs. As you
                        know, for a while the controversy included the legal question as to whether
                        the Act itself authorized substantial grants and the nature of the
                        limitations imposed by the Act on the use of such grants. That legal
                        question has been answered in the memorandum you sent to Dr. Bennett on
                        December 19, 1951<note n="2" xml:id="d77fn2">Not found in Department of
                            State files.</note> and in the supplemental memorandum that I gave to
                        Mr. Andrews after the development of further legislative history on this
                        point, on July 25, 1952.<note n="2" target="d76fn2">Not found in Department
                            of State files.</note> (All of this material is collected in Legal
                        Counsel’s Opinion No. 2 and its attachments, which include a copy of your
                        memorandum and a summary-digest of the Congressional materials on this
                        question developed during 1951.) The answer we have given on the legal
                        question is that grants of machinery, equipment and supplies may be included
                        in Point 4 programs, within the limits of available appropriations, in order
                        to provide demonstration materials for use by the technicians <pb n="259"
                            xml:id="pg_259" facs="0285"/>sent by the United States to underdeveloped
                        countries, and in order to enable the host countries to make a good start in
                        doing the things that the technicians are teaching and demonstrating.</p>
                    <p>This answer to the legal question has, of course, left largely unresolved the
                        policy issue as to how large Point 4 grants should be. Three points of view
                        have been urged: <list>
                            <label>(a)</label>
                            <item>The Point 4 Program should consist principally of making available
                                the services of technicians, and grants of supplies and equipment
                                should be kept to the absolute minimum necessary for demonstration
                                purposes. For the 35 countries in which <gloss target="#t_TCA1"
                                    >TCA</gloss> is now operating, annual appropriations of
                                approximately $50,000,000 should be sufficient.</item>
                            <label>(b)</label>
                            <item>The Point 4 Program should make available not only the services of
                                technicians but also such grants of machinery, equipment and
                                supplies as may be needed to enable the underdeveloped countries to
                                make very substantial progress in developing their economies within
                                the next two decades. Some private groups have spoken of “a TVA on
                                the Nile” and “a TVA on the Ganges”, of steel plants and of
                                considerable industrialization, to be financed in large part through
                                the Point 4 Program, supplemented, of course, by the expenditures of
                                the host governments themselves and by private investment. People
                                outside the Department have sometimes urged appropriations as high
                                as one billion dollars a year for ten years. Some people inside the
                                Department have urged appropriations of $500,000,000 to $700,000,000
                                per year.</item>
                            <label>(c)</label>
                            <item>The position originally urged by Dr. Henry G. Bennett, the first
                                Administrator of <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>, by Mr.
                                Andrews, the present Administrator, and that has become the official
                                view of <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> and the Department, is
                                that the grants should be sufficient to make possible a dynamic
                                program that can show significant results year by year but should
                                not attempt to provide any important part of the investment capital
                                that will be needed. The Department asked and received for the
                                fiscal year 1952 $127,000,000 on a global basis and for the fiscal
                                year 1953 $140,000,000. For the fiscal year 1954 it has requested an
                                appropriation of $142,000,000, and it is estimated that $150,000,000
                                per year will be sufficient for the 35 countries in which the
                                program is now operating for a number of years to come.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>This issue became acute within the Department a few weeks ago when we had to
                        decide what appropriation the Department should request for 1954. <gloss
                            target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> recommended a budget request of
                        $142,000,000. The Offices of the Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs,
                        the Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern, South Asian and African Affairs
                        and the Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs urged that substantial
                        economic assistance would be required for India, Pakistan, Iran, Israel and
                        some of the Arab countries and therefore felt that the Point 4 Program
                        should request an appropriation in excess of $600,000,000. The decision went
                        in favor of <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>’s recommendation (largely
                        because of the legislative history developed during 1951—see Legal Counsel’s
                        Opinion No. 2 mentioned <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0286"/>above), but
                        with an important compromise: The Department also decided to ask for new
                        legislation that would authorize additional grants as special economic aid
                        to certain countries, these special grants to be also administered by <gloss
                            target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> but to be regarded as short term in
                        character and not a part of the Point 4 Program. These issues are certain to

                            Be In The Form Of Grants Or Loans.</hi></p>
                    <p>Although the Department has already recommended that the special economic aid
                        referred to above should be given as grants (and the budget submitted to the
                        Congress by President Truman provides for such grants in the sum of
                        $409,000,000 for the fiscal year 1954), <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>
                        is now formulating recommendations to the Secretary that if such special aid
                        is needed it should not be given as grants but, wholly or partly, in the
                        form of “specially favorable long term development loans”. The quoted phrase
                        refers to loans that would have amortization periods up to 35 years, very
                        low interest rates (as low as zero per cent for non-income producing
                        projects such as schools and health centers), deferred payment dates for the
                        initial installment of principal and interest and, possibly, provision for
                        repayment in non-dollar currencies or in commodities.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>’s recommendation will argue that large
                        scale grants to underdeveloped countries are not effective means for
                        realizing the ends sought, aside from being increasingly unpopular with
                        Congress and the public. The economists for the Export-Import Bank (which
                        probably would be the lending agency for such specially favorable loans) are
                        likely to object to making such loans on the ground that they are “fuzzy”
                        loans which blur the distinction between loans and grants and weaken the
                        ability of the recipient country to qualify for “hard” loans.</p>
                    <p>When this issue arises, it is likely to raise a whole series of questions
                        that will require answers: Does the United States really need to give
                        “special economic aid” to any of these countries, in addition to (a) the
                        Point 4 Program, (b) the loans that now can be secured from the
                        Export-Import Bank and the International Bank for Reconstruction and
                        Development, and (c) the efforts of the United States to stimulate and
                        increase private investment in underdeveloped countries? If a case can be
                        made for such special aid to India, Pakistan, Iran, Israel and three or four
                        of the Arab countries, what amounts of aid are needed, and should that aid
                        be given as grants or as such specially favorable long term loans?</p>

                            Assistance For Crop Failures Or Other Crises.</hi></p>
                    <p>Every now and then the Department receives urgent cables from its Embassy in
                        one of the underdeveloped countries reporting that a drought or some other
                        calamity has caused a wheat shortage that threatens famine and serious
                        internal unrest. The cable usually urges that the Department protect its
                        foreign policy objectives in the country and in the area by making an
                        immediate grant of wheat or other assistance to prevent riots or even
                        internal collapse. Such a situation developed in Jordan in 1951 and was met
                        by a special grant of wheat to the value of $1,250,000. Authority for this
                        was found in the provisions of the Economic Cooperation Act of 1948,<note

                            137.</note> as supplemented by the Mutual Security Act of 1951.<note

                            see 65 Stat. 373.</note> During 1952 similar crises developed in
                        Pakistan, Afghanistan and Egypt. Wheat was supplied to Pakistan and
                        Afghanistan under a somewhat obscure provision that was found in the China
                        Area Aid Act, and approximately $10,000,000 worth of wheat will soon be made
                        available to Egypt under Section 503 of the Mutual Security Act of 1952.
                        There are now developing rumblings that indicate that similar assistance
                        will be requested for Libya and possibly a second time for Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>The difficulty in all of these cases is that these requests necessitate some
                        stretching of statutory provisions which were intended for other purposes
                        and something of a diversion of funds from the purposes for which they were
                        directly appropriated to meet these urgent needs.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> is particularly concerned over this
                        series of crises because it is the only operating agency in the Department
                        that administers economic aid programs. It is, therefore, constantly under
                        pressure to find authority and funds to meet these crises.</p>
                    <p>The straightforward solution to this problem would seem to be for the
                        Department to submit proposed legislation to the Congress under which the
                        President would be authorized, when he found that such an emergency in a
                        foreign country endangered the security interests of the United States, to
                        allocate money to the Secretary of State or to any other suitable agency of
                        the Government, from an emergency fund to be made available for that
                        purpose, to give aid, in the form of either a loan or a grant, or both, for
                        a long enough period to enable him to report the situation to Congress with
                        recommendation for such further action as may be needed. <gloss
                            target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> has urged the Department to recommend such
                        legislation, but <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0288"/>the difficulty is
                        that it seems unlikely that the Congress would approve such a proposal. The
                        question should be re-examined because the new Congress may be willing to
                        give the new President what the previous Congress would definitely refuse to
                        give to the former Administration.</p>

                    <p>Some of the President’s advisers are known to favor the establishment of a
                        new agency outside the State Department to administer all foreign economic
                        assistance programs. This proposal has a long history; in its latest version
                        it is said to propose that the Mutual Security Agency, the Export-Import
                        Bank, <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> and the Office of the Assistant
                        Secretary of State for Economic Affairs be consolidated into an independent
                        agency reporting to the President.</p>
                    <p>The principal argument in favor of this proposal has been that it would
                        facilitate coordination among the foreign economic assistance programs, and
                        should be able to promote administrative efficiency and economy.</p>
                    <p>The Department and <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> have objected to this
                        proposal on the following grounds: <list>
                            <label>(a)</label>
                            <item>The administration of foreign economic assistance is a very
                                important part of the administration of the foreign policy of the
                                United States. To remove the Point 4 Program from the State
                                Department would be to remove from the Department one of its most
                                effective arms for realizing foreign policy objectives in the
                                underdeveloped countries. Coordination in Washington between policy
                                and operations would become more difficult, and, in the host
                                countries themselves, the American head of the economic assistance
                                operation would become a competitor of the American Ambassador. The

                                Country Directors and the American Ambassadors are today much more
                                friendly and effective than those between the Country Directors of
                                the Mutual Security Agency (which is outside the Department) and the

                                will support and strengthen the military defense effort of the

                                    >TCA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> in a single
                                agency would tend to create a strong impression, both in the United
                                States and abroad, that the Point 4 Program is a part of the ”cold
                                war“ and is closely associated with military and defense support
                                operations. Such an impression would greatly weaken the
                                effectiveness of Point 4 and would jeopardize the acceptability of
                                the program in a number of important countries, among them India,
                                Indonesia, Burma, Iran, several of the Arab countries and
                                others.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>The Export-Import Bank would undoubtedly also oppose the proposal on the
                        ground that it is unwise to combine lending programs <pb n="263"
                            xml:id="pg_263" facs="0289"/>with grant programs in a single agency.
                        There is probably much merit to this objection.</p>
                    <p>Another form of this proposal has advocated that <gloss target="#t_MSA1"
                            >MSA</gloss> be transferred to the State Department so that it and
                            <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> could be consolidated within the
                        Department. While this variation of the proposal would meet the first of the
                        two objections stated above, it would not meet the second. <gloss
                            target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> would still strongly urge that it be kept
                        organizationally separate from agencies administering defense support
                        operations.</p>
                    <p>The basic idea of the Point 4 Program has developed tremendous appeal for the
                        governments and peoples of the underdeveloped countries—more than half the
                        population of the world. The idea was launched only four years ago, and
                        became law only two and a half years ago but already it is one of the most
                        potent ideas in our foreign policy. We should be very careful not to dilute
                        the appeal of this program by the way we organize and administer it.<note

                    <p>As of possible use to you in your luncheon with Mr. Black on Monday, I am
                        setting forth below a few points of mutual interest:</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Relations.</hi> Mr. Black has recently written a
                        memorandum to Mr. Humphrey concerning this matter.<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d78fn1">Not further identified.</note> It may be subsequently

                        discussion there. I am told that there is very little new in this memorandum
                        but it does express Mr. Black’s view that the respective areas of operation
                        of the two Banks have not yet been adequately delineated. While I think we
                        have made considerable progress in the last couple of years on this subject,
                        certainly much remains to be done. How much of this remaining work can be
                        done by drawing up agreements, I am not quite sure. More important, it seems
                        to me, would be good working relations between the staffs of the two Banks
                        and frequent consultations between Mr. Black and the Chairman of the <gloss

                        but they have generally foundered on bureaucratic shoals.</p>
                    <p>The Department has had unwillingly to make certain decisions concerning the
                        distribution of projects in Brazil, for example, between the two Banks.
                        These decisions, we hope, were based upon the policy guidance we got from
                        the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. It is not a role which we have
                        enjoyed and one which we have felt is not essential if the two Banks would
                        establish closer relations.</p>

                        formal channel between the U.S. Government and the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1"
                            >IBRD</gloss> is through the U.S. Executive Director, we have not had
                        for a good many years a Director who has been able to devote sufficient time
                        to this matter to constitute a thoroughly effective line of communication.
                        Additionally, the importance of the Bank’s operations to our foreign policy
                        is such that both the Bank and ourselves have found it necessary and
                        desirable to communicate directly. In the <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss>
                        area it has always been our practice to keep the U.S. Director informed of
                        these contacts but unfortunately many instances have occurred where parts of
                        the Department have not fully appreciated the necessity of keeping the U.S.
                        Director and yourself adequately briefed. While we think this is in large
                        measure a departmental problem, to some extent Mr. Black’s willingness to
                        have these contacts has prevented us from performing what I regard to be a
                        useful function. There are instances which could be mentioned that would
                        illustrate this point. I conclude from all of this that it would be highly
                        desirable if Mr. Black could look to you as the primary point of contact in
                        the Department on problems which he feels he needs some consultation with
                        the Department. This does not mean, of course, that you yourself would have
                        to be continuously concerned with these matters but it would certainly mean
                        that you would be fully informed on difficulties and how they are being
                        dealt with. This is all the more important by virtue of your representation
                        of the Department on the <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1"

                        Bank’s operations have become increasingly successful under Mr. Black.
                        Needless to say it is our feeling that further expansion of these activities
                        is now even more important and a greater reliance is being placed upon the

                        policy.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Linder thanked Mr. Black for his courtesy in coming to his office to
                        discuss International Bank relations with the Department and the
                        Export-Import Bank. Mr. Linder said he had no particular matters to take up
                        but because of his position on the Board of the Export-Import Bank and the
                        Department’s interest in the operations of the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1"
                            >IBRD</gloss>, he thought the meeting would be a most useful one to
                        him.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Black immediately launched a discussion of the Turkish approach to the
                            <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss> for a $90 million loan
                        and the Brazilian failure to carry through on the railroad reorganization.
                        Mr. Black felt that the U.S. Government had to make up its mind concerning
                        the role of the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> if that institution
                        was to be successful in its mission. He felt that so long as the opportunity
                        and the invitation existed for countries to go around the <gloss
                            target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> to the <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1"
                            >Eximbank</gloss> it would be impossible for the <gloss
                            target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> to secure the type of action and attitude
                        conducive to their development, and he felt this was particularly the case
                        with Brazil. He had no objections to a Brazilian back-log loan but he had
                        strong objections to <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss> loans
                        to Brazil for railroad and other developmental type projects. He found
                        particularly offensive the reception by the <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1"
                            >Eximbank</gloss> of the Turkish approach for $90 million. He believed
                        that the International Bank had been very considerate and constructive in
                        its dealings with Turkey and there was no excuse for the Turks going to the
                            <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0292"/><gloss
                            target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss>. Loans of this magnitude to
                        Turkey would imperil the investment that the International Bank already has
                        in that country.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Linder addressed himself to Mr. Black’s general proposition that the
                            <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> must do all developmental lending
                        to its member countries. He thought this was a generally sound position but
                        he wished to point out that the political interests of the U.S. were such
                        that complete rigidity or inflexibility on this point might not be workable.
                        He illustrated this point by reference to Iran where a loan operation might
                        be necessary for reasons of national interest. Mr. Linder admitted that the
                        Turkish matter was extremely unfortunate but that the Turks had received no
                        encouragement from the Department or the <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1"
                            >Eximbank</gloss> to make this approach and the Department had no
                        objection to the Turks being told that their application would not be
                        considered. (I understand the Turks have assured Mr. Black that their
                        informal application to the <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1"
                            >Eximbank</gloss> will be withdrawn.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. Linder asked Mr. Black how he felt about Export-Import Bank development
                        lending without Government guarantees and exporter credits. Mr. Black was
                        somewhat evasive in his response but later remarks indicated that he hoped
                        the I.F.C. would circumscribe this <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1"
                            >Eximbank</gloss> activity. Mr. Linder pointed out that too great a
                        restriction in <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss>’s scope of
                        operations would tend to give encouragement to those seeking to establish as
                        a permanent feature of our foreign economic policy the “fuzzy” loan concept.
                        To the extent that all appropriate public lending activities can be covered
                        by the two Banks, there will be no justifiable case for other types of
                        loans.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Black reverted to his main point that the U.S. Government had to make up
                        its mind concerning the International Bank operations because each time the
                        issue was confused by the <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss>
                        participation in developmental lending, he would certainly recommend that
                        the International Bank wash its hands of that country. Mr. Black did concede
                        that the present <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> policy regarding the
                        operations of the two Banks was not in and of itself defective but it had
                        not been carried out. He agreed that had the <gloss
                            target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss> fully accepted all the
                        implications of the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> decision that many
                        of the difficulties to which he referred might not have arisen. He said that
                        he had been asked to recommend new people to put on the <gloss
                            target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss> Board but would not do so
                        until he was assured that the U.S. Government would support a clear-cut
                        policy reserving developmental lending to the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1"
                            >IBRD</gloss>. Mr. Black admitted that there were many areas of the
                        world where the <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss>–<gloss
                            target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> difficulties had not arisen and that the
                        only major problem outstanding was Brazil.</p>

                    <p>Through the guaranty program, the U.S. Government offers, for a fee,

                        Protection against currency inconvertibility was authorized by the <gloss

                    <p>All the countries for which aid is authorized by the Mutual Security Act of
                        1951 are eligible to participate in the program. The assurances required to
                        make the program operative have been obtained from 17 countries with respect
                        to convertibility guaranties and from 15 of these 17 with respect to
                        expropriation guaranties. Among the 17 are 4 of the non-European countries
                        made eligible by the 1951 Act—China, Israel, Haiti and the Philippines. At
                        March 31, 1953, 44 convertibility guaranties totaling $38,044,017 and 3
                        expropriation guaranties totaling $1,574,231, had been issued covering
                        investments in 6 countries: France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Turkey
                        and the United Kingdom. The contracts issued range in amount from less than
                        $20, 000 to more than $14,000,000, and protect investments in industries so
                        diverse as oil refining, sewing machine manufacture, seed cultivation,
                        pharmaceuticals manufacture, and carbon black manufacture.</p>

                        paid. Fifty-one applications for convertibility guaranties, totaling
                        $41,000,000, and 22 applications for expropriation guaranties, totaling
                        $17,000,000, or a total of 73 applications for $58,000,000, were in process

                                new investments. The program has not yet been extended to the
                                underdeveloped areas where protection against political risks may be
                                most needed. The potentialities of the protection offered by the
                                program are not fully understood by the business and financial
                                communities either here or abroad, largely because of inadequate

                    <p>1. At its 14th Session the <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> had
                        before it a report of the International Bank on the proposal for an
                        International Finance Corporation. The purpose of the Corporation was
                        described in the report as “to promote economic development through the
                        stimulation of private investment in its member countries”, which it would
                        do “through equity investments and loans without government guarantee”. The
                        report was discussed at some length, although the Council took no position
                        on the establishment of such a Corporation. However, it did adopt a
                            resolution<note n="*" xml:id="d81fn-sym9">No. 417 of June 23, 1952. Text

                            the source text.]</note> which noted the Bank’s intention of continuing
                        its examination of the proposal, and requested the Bank to inform the
                        Council during 1953 of the results of its further examination of the
                        proposal and the action it has taken concerning it. The General Assembly
                        subsequently adopted a resolution which took note of the foregoing
                        resolution of <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>, and requested the
                        Council “to report to the General Assembly at its eighth session on the
                        progress made in regard to the proposal for the establishment of an

                                >IBRD</gloss> Report. [Footnote in the source text]</note> The
                        present report on the status of the International Finance Corporation
                        proposal has been submitted pursuant to these resolutions.</p>
                    <p>2. The purpose of the present report is, in the Bank’s words, “to inform the
                        Council of the results of the Bank’s consultations concerning the proposed
                        institution since transmittal of its earlier report”. These consultations
                        have been largely of an informal nature. Although the Council’s resolution
                        left the nature of the requested consultations to the discretion of the
                        Bank, certain delegations may express regret that the Bank did not take more
                        initiative in seeking authoritative expressions of opinion from its member
                        governments. Clearly, it is not incumbent upon the U.S. Delegation to defend
                        the Bank from this sort of criticism, although the Bank’s reluctance to
                        undertake formal consultations presumably arose from its knowledge that the
                        U.S. Government had not, and probably could not, reach a firm decision on
                        the <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> proposal prior to this session of
                        the <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>. Although, in terms of the
                            <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> resolution, the criticism is
                        probably justified, the Delegation should not associate itself with
                        criticism of this kind.</p>
                    <p>3. Certain delegations may also be critical of the Bank for not reporting
                        upon its further examination of the <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss>
                        proposal. The Bank excuses itself with the statement that “countries on whom
                            <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0297"/>the Corporation would
                        necessarily have to depend for the greater part of its funds have not as yet
                        indicated that they are ready to commit themselves to subscribe to its
                        capital”. On the other hand, the positions which governments eventually take
                        will be influenced by the way in which the proposal is presented, and the
                        nature of the examination to which it is subjected. Clearly all the
                        procedural and organizational problems need not and cannot be determined in
                        advance, but the basic purposes and functions require thorough examination.
                        Some of these basic questions are: <list>

                        not been discussed further in the Council. Nonetheless, consideration might
                        be given to the question in connection with the present <gloss
                            target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> discussion of the <gloss
                            target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss>. Such a clearinghouse might provide a
                        central point for information of this kind and for contact between potential

                        helpful contribution to the encouragement of private foreign investment.</p>
                    <p>Without taking the initiative in any debate on the Bank’s failure to fulfill
                        the terms of the last years <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>
                        resolution, the U.S. Delegation could well indicate that questions of this
                        kind are not without merit, and should be considered in further study of the
                            <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> proposal. The U.S. Delegation should
                        use its good offices to avoid <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0298"/>and
                        abstain from voting on a motion which expresses regret at the nature of the
                        Bank’s examination of the proposal as evidenced by the present report. It
                        would be preferable, however, for comments of this nature to be expressed in
                        terms of the Bank’s future study of the proposal rather than its past
                        performance.</p>
                    <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> resolution also suggested
                        that governments consult with national organizations and business groups
                        concerning the <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss>. Although certain
                        organizations, such as the National Foreign Trade Council, and individual
                        representatives of American companies have expressed views concerning the
                            <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> the U.S. Government has not
                        undertaken any systematic consultations with the private community. The U.S.
                        Delegation should acknowledge that it has not yet responded adequately to
                        the suggestion concerning such consultations. Since the views which have
                        been expressed in business circles have been largely negative, it has been
                        felt that no useful purpose would be served by further consultations until
                        the U.S. Government had reached a tentative position on the merits of the
                        proposal.</p>
                    <p>5. The Delegation should frankly admit that the U.S. Government has not yet
                        formulated its position on the <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> proposal.
                        It should point out that the new Administration has determined to study all
                        aspects of American foreign economic policy before making certain basic
                        policy decisions. This includes the appropriate U.S. Government
                        participation in the matter of stimulating the international flow of private
                        capital in which the <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> has to be weighed
                        against other proposed measures. Therefore, it has seemed premature to
                        attempt to reach a position on the <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> until
                        the entire subject has been studied. There may be a disposition on the part
                        of some delegations to enter into a full discussion of the substance and
                        merits of the <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> proposal. Obviously the
                        U.S. Delegation cannot stop such a discussion, but it should not participate
                        nor should it associate itself with any resolution which expresses a
                        position on the feasibility and desirability of an <gloss target="#t_IFC1"
                            >IFC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>6. It is difficult to predict what action the <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                            >ECOSOC</gloss> is apt to take as the next step with respect to the
                            <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> proposal. In view of the inadequacy
                        of the Bank’s report there may be a move to take its further consideration
                        out of the hands of the Bank and to refer it instead to the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretariat or, more likely, to a group of
                        experts designated by the Secretary-General. The U.S. Delegation should
                        resist such a move. In view of its experience with the problem of
                        development the Bank is particularly equipped to carry forward the study.
                        The fact that the present report is by no means a final one, which the Bank
                        would be the first to admit, should not be the basis for any action which
                        implies that the Bank is incompetent to continue the study. Should a
                        resolution be introduced which calls <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0299"
                        />upon the Bank to continue its study, with the expectation of submitting a
                        report in 1954, the U.S. Delegation should support it. Such a report should
                        be available in time for it to be considered by governments in consultation
                        with their private interests, prior to being called upon to express a
                        position in the <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> (preferably the
                        18th session) or in any other international body.</p>
                    <p>7. It is unlikely that a proposal will be made to remove the item permanently
                        from the <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> agenda and leave it
                        entirely to the Bank for further study and action. However, the U.S.
                        Delegation should support such a proposal if any substantial sentiment
                        should develop for it.</p>

                        President’s proposal for a fund for world aid and reconstruction. Attention
                        would thereby be focused again upon the fact that it is the USSR which is
                        holding up international efforts to promote economic development. A large
                        body of world opinion would be further encouraged to support multilateral
                        disarmament. We should therefore take the initiative to propose a resolution
                        based on the President’s pledge. Clearly such a proposal would have stronger

                        Section I, “Comments on Other Delegations at the Conference.”]</p>
                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">II. Objectives and Results</hi></p>
                    <p>The United States Delegation did not come to this session of the Council with
                        any “bold new program” to establish. The objective in both the social and
                        economic fields was rather in the nature of a holding action: to avoid any
                        large-scale financial commitments, direct or implied, to adjust and improve
                        programs already underway.</p>
                    <p>This has generally been accomplished with only minor sacrifices of the United
                        States position. With the exception of taking the forced labor and freedom
                        of information items off the agenda, the actions of the Council have
                        supported the United States position or have been, at least, satisfactory
                        compromises. The number of actions taken by unanimous vote has been quite
                        gratifying.</p>
                    <p>It might also be stated that one of the major accomplishments was the
                        improvement of our relations with practically all of the nations
                        represented. Every member of the Delegation, including the <pb n="277"
                            xml:id="pg_277" facs="0303"/>permanent staff in Geneva, worked for this
                        objective, apparently with some success. As well as can be judged, the
                        United States Delegation as a whole conducted itself with the efficiency and
                        dignity so as to earn the respect of other delegations. The credit for this,
                        in large measure is due the chairman of the Delegation, Mr. John C. Baker.
                        Although he himself would object, it should be mentioned that his success in
                        working with other delegations and his inspiring leadership resulted in a
                        remarkably smooth working and cooperative Delegation throughout.</p>
                    <p>At the 16th Session, we played for time on the ground that a comprehensive
                        review of U.S. foreign economic policy was under way and would take until at
                        least next spring to complete.<note n="2" xml:id="d84fn2">The Commission on
                            Foreign Economic Policy, chaired by Clarence B. Randall, was established
                            by President Eisenhower in early 1953 to conduct a thorough review of
                            U.S. foreign economic policy. The Commission submitted its <hi

                            49</ref>.</note> But will we be ready to move forward next spring,
                        within the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> framework, with an imaginative,
                        constructive line that will maintain our position of leadership and
                        strengthen the confidence and security of our friends?</p>
                    <p>We profess great faith in the United Nations but we have reached the point
                        where we must be better prepared to demonstrate that faith in concrete
                        economic and social programs, which are not completely dwarfed by our
                        bilateral programs, or we must temper our professions of faith. We need both
                        a better understanding of our long-term objectives in the Economic and
                        Social Council and of our overall objectives at each session.</p>
                    <p>The results on the more important items as summarized by the member of the
                        Delegation responsible are as follows:</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of several reports, of a review of 1954 programs,
                        and of the issue of full employment.]</p>

                            Economic Development</hi></p>
                    <p>This item was generally regarded by underdeveloped countries as the most
                        important on our agenda. The detailed plan for a development fund (<gloss
                            target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>) represented the culmination of
                        several years’ effort by them to establish such a fund within the United
                        Nations.</p>
                    <p>Despite our admittedly excellent record of financial assistance to
                        underdeveloped countries, the United States, because of its refusal to
                        cooperate in the establishment of a development fund within the United
                        Nations, and because its support of such fund was essential to its creation,
                        became the focus of resentment by the underdeveloped countries, which
                        regarded the United States as the main obstacle to United Nations action in
                        this field. In this connection, it should be noted that the representatives
                        of many underdeveloped <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0304"/>countries
                        were prepared even to accept some reduction in the total amount of
                        assistance available to them, provided that a part of this assistance moved
                        through a United Nations fund.</p>
                    <p>From our point of view, the President’s speech of April 16<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d84fn3">See footnote 3, <ref target="#pg_273">p.
                            273</ref>.</note> represented an important change in the position of the
                        United States in this matter, particularly in the light of the
                        interpretation which the Delegation was authorized to make to the Council,
                        i.e., that the President meant an international fund designed to strengthen
                        the United Nations. We recognized that the President’s promise was one that
                        probably could not be acted upon in the near future, and that the
                        underdeveloped countries were impatient to move ahead with the special
                        development fund. Moreover, an integral part of our position continued to be
                        opposition to any further action now, such as refinement of the <gloss
                            target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> blueprint, looking to creation of a
                        special fund. Nevertheless, it was hoped that the promise of a substantial
                        development fund after genuine disarmament would be greeted as an important
                        positive change on our part in the Council.</p>
                    <p>As it turned out, our new position was received without enthusiasm by both
                        the developed and the underdeveloped countries. The former were unhappy at
                        the prospect of losing the shelter of United States opposition to the
                        demands of the underdeveloped countries, and the latter felt that the
                        preconditions attached were such as almost to make certain that we would
                        never have to make good on our offer in respect to the fund. This, together
                        with our attempt to write into the <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>
                        resolution a statement that it was premature to take any further steps at
                        this time looking to a development fund, made our basic position
                        unacceptable to the underdeveloped countries.</p>
                    <p>To avoid a Council split on this issue, the resolution as agreed simply
                        transmits the <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> report to the
                        Assembly, which is left to consider what other preparatory steps might
                        usefully be taken. Our proposed Assembly declaration looking to an
                        international fund after genuine disarmament is also included.</p>
                    <p>While our pledge regarding an international development fund and our call to
                        others to join in such pledge did not bring spontaneous wide support in the
                        Council, the importance of our pledge eventually was publicly acknowledged
                        by many of the underdeveloped countries. Also, while we were unable to
                        obtain majority support for our view that further action on <gloss
                            target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> now was premature, we were able to
                        avoid having the Council make positive recommendations for such action to
                        the Assembly, and the matter is left to be dealt with there. We also made
                        clear in the record that our view <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0305"
                        />continued to be that no further preparatory action would be useful at this
                            time.<note n="4" xml:id="d84fn4">For a brief summary of the treatment of

                    <p>The position of the United States at the Technical Assistance Committee was a
                        difficult one because of the uncertainty of the United States financial
                        support for the program. It was therefore felt that our delegation should
                        not assume its usual leadership in the discussions. The results of the
                        session were entirely in line with our own aim: the concept of and
                        procedures for country planning were clarified, the role of the Resident
                        Representatives was strongly supported, the allocation of funds for 1954 is
                        within the scope of our instructions, and the financial procedures and
                        future methods of allocation of funds are subject to study by a working
                        party.</p>

                        <item>The proposal to establish an International Finance Corporation has
                            been before the United Nations and the International Bank, in one form
                            or another, for about three years. You will recall that, as presently
                            proposed, the Corporation would be an affiliate of the International
                            Bank authorized to assist private enterprise by loans without government
                            guarantees and by equity participation along with private capital. Mr.
                            Black has indicated that a subscription of $50 to 100 million would be
                            sufficient at the outset.</item>

                            governmental position on the feasibility or desirability of an <gloss

                            that the possibility of further useful work depends on the attitude of

                            States. Neither the French nor the British have as yet taken a position,

                    <p>It would seem that we can hardly expect continued indulgence beyond the 18th
                        Session of the <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> on the part of
                        other members of the United Nations with a refusal by the United States to
                        say yes or no on this matter. At the very least, other countries will expect
                        a pretty clear indication of the direction our thinking is taking. To
                        discharge our obligations under existing <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        resolutions on this matter, we should undertake fairly soon a full dress
                        study of the proposal on its merits—before the International Bank presents
                        its next report to <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>. This would
                        perhaps involve collaboration with the Bank as it carries forward such

                        extensive soundings of Congressional and business opinion concerning the
                        proposal. Governments were requested to make such soundings of business

                        Commerce in connection with the proposed policy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Buck explained that the <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> proposal was
                        a step toward using loans rather than grants in the aid program. Under the
                        proposal, repayments of loans in either foreign currencies or dollars would
                        go into a special revolving fund, which could be used for <pb n="282"
                            xml:id="pg_282" facs="0308"/>loans and other purposes without further
                        reference to the Congress, provided the uses were covered by the original
                        loan agreement. The <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> proposal would
                        permit such use of local currencies without regard to the provision of law
                        (Section 1415 of Supplemental Appropriation Act, 1953)<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d86fn3">Public Law 547, enacted July 15, 1952; for text of
                            Section 1415, see 66 Stat. 662.</note> which requires corresponding
                        payments out of dollar appropriations. He added that the special fund was
                        envisaged as a fund that would be built up over the years; to the extent
                        that it did so the need for additional appropriations would be obviated.</p>
                    <p>The Council discussed the proposal at length, with particular reference to
                        United States policy on loans with uncertain repayment prospects. Mr.
                        Anderson felt that the <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> proposal would
                        put a premium on attempting to devise schemes for using repayment proceeds
                        which would be received a considerable time in the future. Mr. Kalijarvi
                        foresaw difficulties with the Congress on the proposal because of its
                        departure from usual fiscal practices. Mr. Brundage stated that the Bureau
                        of the Budget and the General Accounting Office are opposed to the use of
                        contingency reserves, of which the proposed special fund would be one type.
                        Mr. Overby recalled that the Executive Branch has historically been opposed
                        to “fuzzy” loans, but he noted the recent statements of the Randall
                        Commission and of the President which appeared to involve approval of the
                        concept. Mr. Hutchinson felt that Mr. Randall was thinking in terms of
                        dollar loans with vague repayment prospects rather than of loans which would
                        be repaid in local currency. General Edgerton stated that “fuzzy” loans are
                        distinguished from <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss> and
                        International Bank loans by the interest rate provisions and by terms of
                        repayment. He felt that under some unusual conditions there might be a place
                        for loans which would leave a residual amount for renegotiation at the end
                        of the repayment term, or for loans with grace periods long enough to allow
                        the projects to begin to pay off. The normal business of the <gloss
                            target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss> could be damaged if such
                        loans were ineptly negotiated, however, and he felt that the <gloss
                            target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss> should be informed about such
                        loan proposals early, before the prospective borrowers have their appetites
                        whetted for easy loan terms. The Chairman directed that the minutes record
                        the importance of close consultation between <gloss target="#t_FOA1"
                            >FOA</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss>
                        and the International Bank with respect to such loan proposals.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman observed that the discussion indicated the need for great
                        ingenuity in providing for a satisfactory mechanism for making “fuzzy” loans
                        without raising the likelihood of disputes with prospective borrowers over
                        the terms of repayment and possible <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0309"
                        />formal default, and that it raised a serious question concerning the use
                        of contingency reserves by Government agencies.</p>
                    <p>After some further discussion of the mechanics of the proposed fund, the
                        Council turned to the question of the amount. It was suggested that it might
                        be undesirable to name a specific sum, especially in view of the fact that
                        $100 million would be a very substantial proportion of the total aid funds
                        available, apart from the amount earmarked for Korea and Formosa. Mr. Buck
                        felt that $100 million represented a fair proportion of the total aid
                        program. Mr. Anderson pointed out that in view of their past exclusion from
                        the foreign aid program and their continuing aspirations for aid from the
                        United States, Latin American countries might feel that a “fuzzy” loan
                        program with a specific sum named would be earmarked for them. He felt that
                        this might raise problems in the administration of the program.</p>
                    <p>The Council then discussed the question of whether the draft legislation
                        should provide for Congressional authorization for the use of the repayment
                        proceeds paid into the proposed special fund. Several legal questions were
                        raised which it was agreed would be checked by the legal staffs. Subject to
                        resolution of these questions, the Council agreed that the paper should
                        provide that the special fund could be used for either new loans or new
                        purposes only if authorized by the Congress. The Council also discussed the
                        type of projects which would be appropriate for “fuzzy” loans and agreed
                        that the paper should allow flexibility in the selection of such projects.
                        The Council finally agreed that the part of the paper dealing with the use
                        of local currency repayments should refer to agreements between the United
                        States and the borrowing countries. (Following the meeting the Foreign
                        Operations Administration revised the paper in accordance with these
                        suggestions. See <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Document No. 1635

                        is a responsible estimate in the U.S. Government that the recipient country
                        has a future capacity to repay on the terms of the loan.</p>
                    <p>That it is not desirable U.S. policy to make a loan if it is estimated the
                        other country could not repay it; if the country could not repay a loan and
                        needs aid, from the standpoint of our national foreign policy it should be a

                        that the loans shall not be made in a manner that would substantially impair

                    <p>Mr. Anderson suggested that as part of the United States preparation for the

                        proposal for the establishment of an <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> as
                        an experiment for a term of 5 years with a provision for its automatic
                        liquidation at the end of that time unless two-thirds of the stockholders
                        voted affirmatively to continue it. He felt that such a plan could
                        appropriately be presented to the Rio Conference as a United States policy
                        proposal for submission to the next Congress. Thus, he favored a suitable
                        modification of Alternative B. Mr. Overby outlined the principal substantive
                        arguments against the <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss>, i.e., that the
                        use of Government funds for equity investment is not desirable; and that the
                        operations of an <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> by shielding
                        underdeveloped countries from the forces that might otherwise persuade them
                        to establish attractive conditions for private investment, would discourage
                        private investment rather than encourage it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Waugh argued that the proposal was substantial and important and that,
                        therefore, the 17 months already elapsed was not an unreasonable period of
                        time for the new administration to study it. He felt that the Export-Import
                        Bank has been doing a substantial business in loans, and that the Foreign
                        Operations Administration loan policy proposals may be significant. He did
                        not like the use of United States Government funds in equity financing and
                        thought that the possibility of regional development banks might be explored
                        more fully. He stated that the Department of State preferred Alternative B
                        with the thought of examining the case again in a year. He would oppose any
                        announcement of intention at the Rio Conference and would rather prefer to
                        see the United States Delegation discuss what had already been done by the
                        Export-Import Bank and <gloss target="#t_FOA1">F.O.A.</gloss></p>
                    <p>Mr. Marget favored the substance of Alternative B with perhaps some revision
                        of the language, with the understanding that there be no United States
                        commitment to the proposal. General Edgerton and Mr. Whipple indicated that
                        their preference would be for Alternative A. Mr. Overby suggested that any
                        further study of the proposal should be done by the International Bank
                        rather than by <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Burgess summarized the discussion by saying that the consensus was in
                        favor of Alternative B without too much encouragement for the idea of
                        establishing an <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss>. He suggested that the
                        Staff Committee could work out any revisions in the wording of the <pb

                    </list>
                    <p>The failure of Congress to appropriate funds for the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> Technical Assistance Program for 1955 necessitates an urgent
                        reexamination of our general position in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss>. We should step back for a moment and reflect on what the
                        overall picture adds up to in the light of our long-term national
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>Although the 84th Congress may provide new funds for a TA contribution, the
                        impression which the present action will convey to friend and foe alike is
                        inescapable. If the Soviets have any sense at all they will triple their
                        contribution at the forthcoming pledging conference and take over the
                        program from us lock, stock and barrel. In the language of business,
                        painfully applicable here, they will take over the tangible and intangible
                        assets and the good will. <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0315"/>Our act
                        of self-mutilation may thus cost us very dearly in the scales of the Cold
                        War.</p>
                    <p>This potential disaster—and for planning purposes we must assume the
                        worst—requires that we check over our remaining ammunition to see what shots
                        are left in the locker.</p>
                    <p>Ignoring for the moment our purely verbal policies, what are our current
                        action policies toward the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>? There is only
                        one US action policy toward the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> today of
                        the first magnitude. In effect it is <hi rend="italic">the</hi> US policy
                        toward the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, to which all other policy
                        considerations are subordinated: to keep out the Chinese Communists.</p>
                    <p>There are also some secondary US action policies toward the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, which are executed with vigor. Among them
                        currently are these: to avoid debate on New Guinea; to prevent payment of
                        the Administrative Tribunal Awards; to prevent creation of economic
                        development or financing instrumentalities; to prevent conclusion of
                        treaties in the field of human rights; to prevent election of Satellites to
                        organization or to posts; to curtail contributions to special programs; and
                        to avoid taking a position on one side or the other of any colonial
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>These are illustrative. I personally agree with practically all of them, as
                        individual propositions. But it will be seen that they have one striking
                        feature in common: they are all completely negative. Cumulatively, they tend
                        to give the impression that our participation in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> is at best a holding operation, at worst a liability that we
                        are unwilling or unable to liquidate.</p>
                    <p>Now this is clearly not so, for reasons which need no restatement here. Nor
                        should we necessarily change any of the policies I have listed. The problem,
                        as I see it, is to regain the offensive in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss>, which we have temporarily lost.</p>
                    <p>Although the national interest clearly demands that we make the maximum
                        intelligent use of all available instrumentalities in waging political
                        warfare with the Soviet system, I am not convinced that we are doing this
                        with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss>, completely apart from its possible long-range virtues as a
                        political and legal institution, is, in the here and now, an instrumentality
                        with great potential for blunting the Soviet strategy, which, as laid out at
                        the 19th Party Congress in Moscow in the fall of 1952 by Stalin and
                            Malenkov,<note n="2" xml:id="d90fn2">Georgiy Malenkov, Deputy Chairman
                            of the Soviet Council of Ministers, 1946–1953.</note> is to isolate the
                        “militaristic” United States from the non-communist world. Any ready-made
                        opportunity which the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> offers to accumulate
                        political strength on our side should be seized or, if it does not exist, it
                        should be created. As it is, it is the Soviets who are exploiting the
                        opportunities, and we who are being left behind.</p>
                    <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0316"/>
                    <p>The political logic of planning a counter-offensive in the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is thus compelling, and our national interest
                        is very badly served by policies which are based on the supposed strength of
                        American isolationism or American parsimony. In this connection, the last
                        two Gallup polls show overwhelming public support of the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and so-called “internationalism”, and
                        completely repudiate isolationism as the view of any but a very small
                        minority.</p>
                    <p>What then can we do?</p>
                    <p>If the position on Technical Assistance can somehow be retrieved, the picture
                        will of course improve, in the sense that we will be back where we were two
                        months ago. If another positive and creative program can be developed which
                        has some real content and on which we are prepared to act, the situation
                        will be altered for the better. The atomic pool idea did seem a possible
                        answer to this need, but almost a year has passed without action. One major
                        difficulty is that any constructive program would cost money, thus running
                        counter to present budgetary policies. Also, although this kind of strategy
                        may be worth more in the Cold War than a pair of infantry divisions, the
                        currently invidious label of “do-goodism” makes it very difficult to get a
                        sympathetic hearing for any new non-military project.</p>
                    <p>On Technical Assistance, despite the Department’s failure to appeal directly
                        to Senator Bridges<note n="3" xml:id="d90fn3">Styles Bridges (<gloss
                                target="#t_R1">R</gloss>.–N.H.), Chairman of the Senate

                        is really never too late when the national interest and the national
                        reputation are at stake. In any event, an explanatory statement by the
                        President is clearly called for by considerations of national self-respect.
                        But as to the continuing American predicament in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss>, some fresh, hard and imaginative thinking is in order. I
                        don’t think we in <gloss target="#t_UNA1">UNA</gloss> have the time or the
                        objectivity to do the sort of overall planning needed. Perhaps the Policy
                        Planning Staff could turn their attention to this instrument of diplomacy,
                        which they have consistently undervalued but have never really studied. They
                        just might come up with answers which could command top level confidence. I
                        think they should at least give it a try.</p>

                    <p>The Department normally desires to exchange views with other friendly members
                        of the United Nations concerning economic issues which may be expected to
                        arise during the Ninth General Assembly, scheduled to convene in New York on
                        September 21, 1954. However, after reviewing the proposed agenda (<gloss
                            target="#t_A2">A/</gloss>2667), it is considered that no useful purpose
                        would be served by soliciting the views of governments on these items. In
                        some cases the United States position is well known, and in others it is
                        felt that no additional support for the United States position could be
                        obtained at this time.</p>
                    <p>If, however, during the discussion of other subjects any governments raise
                        questions as to the United States position on any of the economic items, the

                    <p>The 8th Session resolution on <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>
                        invited member governments to transmit to the Secretary General comments on
                        recommendations contained in a blueprint for <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"

                            >ECOSOC</gloss> this summer (18th Session) Mr. Scheyven emphasized the
                        critical problems of underdeveloped countries and stressed the great
                        contribution that such a fund could make to the solution of these problems.
                        In his oral statement to the Council he enlarged upon his written report and
                        indicated growing moral and material support for the Fund. In the opinion of
                        the United States Delegation at the session, and some others, he claimed
                        stronger material support than the replies of governments actually indicate.
                        He did point out, however, that the principal capital exporting countries
                        were not willing to contribute at this time.</p>
                    <p>Several resolutions were introduced by underdeveloped countries recommending
                        more or less specific action toward setting up the Fund by the <gloss

                        Delegate in his speech reiterated the previous United States position on
                        this proposal and indicated that he could not support these resolutions. The
                        United States position has been that international tensions make it
                        necessary to apply large resources to the requirements of defense, that
                        until savings could be achieved through internationally supervised
                        disarmament, there is little likelihood that our people will accept heavy
                        additional financial commitments, that an international fund could not be
                        successfully operated without considerable resources <pb n="293"
                            xml:id="pg_293" facs="0319"/>from many nations, and that to secure these
                        resources would not under present circumstances appear feasible.</p>
                    <p>After some difficult negotiations, and because of the recognition of the
                        underdeveloped countries and Mr. Scheyven that from a practical point of
                        view no further steps toward the establishment of <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1"
                            >SUNFED</gloss> could be made without the cooperation of Great Britain

                        proposal, as to their views on the possibility of supporting such a
                        corporation. The resolution also called upon the International Bank to
                        continue consultation with the governments and to report the results of its
                        further consideration to <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> at the
                        18th Session.</p>
                    <p>There appeared to be a rather surprising lack of enthusiasm for the <gloss

                            >ECOSOC</gloss> (18th) this summer and the debate was limited since it
                        was apparent almost immediately that the majority of the members recognized
                        that the establishment of <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> was not at
                        present practicable. The Council adopted a resolution introduced by
                        Pakistan, Australia, India and Norway recommending that <gloss
                            target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> request member states in a position to
                        provide capital for an <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> to keep the
                        problem under review and that the International Bank report further to the
                        Council upon its consultation with governments and any further suggestions
                        the Bank might have regarding such an institution. In the debate on this
                        item, the United States took the position that we were unconvinced that the
                        establishment at this time of an <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> is
                        either necessary or desirable, but in view of the many difficulties and
                        complex problems raised by the proposal, we were prepared to cooperate with
                        other members of the Council who believed that the matter ought to be kept
                        under review by the International Bank. Accordingly, the United States voted
                        for the resolution.</p>
                    <p>The position which the United States will take at the 9th Session of the

                        and debates which these two items have received in the United Nations over
                        the past few years, however, no relevant issues are now foreseen which would
                        require prior consultation with other governments.</p>

                            Capital:</hi></p>
                    <p>The International flow of private capital for economic development will be on
                        the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> agenda in connection with action taken
                        by <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> at its 17th Session after
                        consideration of a Secretariat study on this subject. One of the conclusions
                        of the study was that an increase in private capital exports today, however
                        important for production in the future, can be expected to make only a minor
                        contribution towards restoring economic stability because the prevailing
                        economic uncertainty tends to reduce the volume of private capital for
                        investment. In the discussion the United States Delegation stressed its
                        sympathy with the desire of underdeveloped countries for accelerated
                        economic development and stated that private capital can play an
                        increasingly important role provided steps are taken to create conditions
                        making for a favorable international investment climate. To these ends it
                        introduced, jointly with Belgium, Pakistan and Turkey, a draft resolution
                        which recognized the necessity for action by the underdeveloped countries to
                        remove impediments to the flow of capital and included a number of
                        recommendations both to countries seeking to attract foreign capital and to
                        countries able to export capital. A compromise resolution finally adopted
                        recommends ways capital importing countries can improve their investment
                        climates and urges capital exporting countries to take measures designed to
                        increase the flow to capital-importing countries. The resolution further
                        recommends that both groups of countries consider the possibility of
                        establishing investment corporations designed to encourage the participation
                        of private investors. The United States accepted the latter provision in
                        order to win the support of some underdeveloped countries for the resolution
                        as a whole.</p>
                    <p>It is expected that the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> will endorse this
                        resolution. Although no issues on it are now foreseen in the Assembly which
                        would require prior consultation with other governments, Missions should
                        take advantage of any opportunity to encourage its support, especially in
                        countries not represented at the 17th <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"

                    <p>In urging this change, delegation points out that under present world

                            <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> can be successfully operated with
                        proper safeguards; 3) <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> would be

                        free enterprise and participation by private capital in under-developed
                        countries; 5) <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> would help to convince
                        under-developed countries that in a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        organization US has their welfare at heart in proposing means of access to
                        secondary and equity financing on approved businesslike projects.</p>
                    <p>It is also suggested that possibility of securing US participation in <gloss

                    <p>It is particularly urgent that our position be changed as now requested
                        because: 1) US position on whole <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> agenda is
                        predominantly negative or neutral, and maintenance of our prestige and
                        leadership is thereby made more difficult: 2) US position on technical
                        assistance is neutral until further Congressional action; 3) there is
                        growing possibility that <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>, under

                    <p>While the operations of the Export-Import Bank have not formed a major part
                        of our overseas financial assistance in the last five or six years, the
                        transactions of the Bank have been significant in our relations with Latin
                        America and with certain other countries. After the extension of the $300
                        million loan to Brazil in early 1953, Reorganization Plan No. 5<note n="2"

                            Export-Import Bank of Washington (Public Law 570), enacted Aug. 9, 1954;
                            for text, see 68 Stat. 677.</note> was submitted to Congress and came
                        into effect in early August. The principal effect of this Plan was to
                        abolish the Board of Directors of the Bank and thereby remove the Secretary
                        of State from his ex officio position as Director. In addition, it removed
                        the Bank’s principal officer from membership in the <gloss target="#t_NAC1"

                    <p>Senator Capehart, in September, commenced hearings upon the operations and
                        organization of the Bank to determine what might be done to reactivate this
                        Organization. At the opening session of Senator Capehart’s Committee on this
                        subject, Secretary Humphrey stated that “The Export-Import Bank implies the
                        aid to exports and imports and to current trade by loans of much more rapid
                        turnover and shorter duration.” He further stated, “However, as Secretary of
                        the Treasury I do want to make clear to everyone that the Government must
                        question both its right and its financial ability to continue to use
                        taxpayers’ money to finance investments abroad on a large scale in the
                        development of competitive enterprise.” (Tab A)<note n="3" xml:id="d93fn3"

                                undesirable from the standpoint of the interests of our country. The
                                bank should sympathetically consider kinds and types of proper loan
                                applications irrespective of term which would aid in facilitating

                    <p>The House Banking and Currency Committee expressed similar views. The Bill

                        interpreted as restricting the operations and field of activity of the

                    <p>The Department has long regarded the Bank as an instrument of foreign policy
                        and in this regard was supported by the Randall Commission Report which
                        reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The Export-Import Bank is essentially an instrument of United States

                                record does not indicate that there has been harmful competition or
                                duplication in the operations of the two banks.”<note n="4"

                    <p>The removal of the State Department from the Board of the Bank eliminated the
                        statutory expression of this point of view. The Treasury was in full accord
                        with this reorganization of the Bank. The Bank is the only permanent
                        financial organization operating in the foreign field. The Department has
                        and must continue to place a great emphasis on the effective operation of
                        the Bank.</p>

                    <p>The attitude of the Treasury towards the types of loans that the
                        Export-Import Bank should properly make is mentioned above. In considerable
                        measure this view was reiterated at a recent <gloss target="#t_NAC1"
                            >NAC</gloss> meeting upon the subject. (Tab C)</p>
                    <p>The Department, both from the point of view of the conduct of foreign
                        relations and foreign economic policy, holds the view that the Bank should
                        not be so limited in its lending policy. The Bank’s <pb n="298"
                            xml:id="pg_298" facs="0324"/>lending policies should be more than the
                        simple promotion of U.S. exports and should look towards participating in a
                        healthy development of the economies of friendly countries, principally in
                        Latin America. This objective cannot be served by severe limitations on the
                        types of loans to be made and upon the terms of such loans.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Legal Authority</hi></p>
                    <p>There is attached a copy of the memorandum by the Legal Adviser<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d93fn5">Herman Phleger.</note> on this point. It demonstrates,
                        and in this it is supported by the Bank’s own officials as well as by
                        legislative history, that this point of view substantially contradicts that
                        expressed by Secretary Humphrey at the recent <gloss target="#t_NAC1"
                            >NAC</gloss> meeting. (Tab D)</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Volume of Lending</hi></p>
                    <p>No detailed discussions have taken place between the Department and the
                        Treasury concerning the volume of prospective lending operations by the
                        Bank. However, it is clear that unless a substantial intensification takes
                        place repayment to the Bank will exceed disbursements. Indeed, the Bank’s
                        officials have estimated that the Export-Import Bank can lend over $5
                        billion in the next ten years with no drain on the Treasury cash budget.

                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Loans vs Aid</hi></p>
                    <p>Unless the Bank’s lending operations are substantially accelerated we will be
                        under real and increasing pressure to seek appropriated funds to assist
                        economic development in Latin America. A more vigorous Export-Import Bank
                        will do much to avoid this eventuality and at the same time will give the
                        U.S. a reasonable prospect of repayment with interest of such loans.</p>
                    <p>Clarification of the foregoing points would do much to give substance to the
                        policy decisions with respect to Latin America taken by the <gloss

                        <item>The Treasury’s paper summarizes the nature of the proposed
                            International Finance Corporation, and the principal conditions which
                            would be attached to its establishment. This proposal has been under
                            discussion in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> since 1951, and
                            throughout these discussions U.S. Delegations have maintained a position
                            against the immediate establishment of an International Finance
                            Corporation but have supported resolutions which kept the proposal alive
                            through further reviews and studies. Upon the recommendation of the
                            entire U.S. delegation to the current session of the General Assembly,
                            this position is now being reviewed (See Tab B).<note n="3"

                            International Finance Corporation proposal, and is prepared to support
                            it in principle along the lines of Treasury’s recommendations. It is
                            felt that the proposal is sound in principle and that it should be
                            undertaken as an experiment in the encouragement of sound private
                            enterprise abroad. Although a great many details of organization,
                            operations and policies remain to be worked out, these can be handled in
                            subsequent consultation with the International Bank for Reconstruction
                            and Development which will presumably be called upon to formulate
                            specific proposals for the establishment <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300"

                        <item>Although the Treasury’s paper does not address itself to a statement
                            of our position during the present session of the General Assembly, it
                            is highly desirable that the Council authorize the delegation to
                            indicate that the U.S. Government now supports in principle the
                            establishment of an International Finance Corporation and to support a
                            resolution in the Assembly to that effect which would also request the
                            International Bank to proceed with the necessary preparations. (This
                            would, of course, be conditional upon securing the necessary
                            appropriation from Congress.) The U.S. delegation is faced in the
                            General Assembly with a number of economic subjects on which it is
                            forced to take negative or neutral positions. Accordingly, if the U.S.
                            is prepared to support the International Finance Corporation proposal,
                            it is essential that this be indicated during the present session.
                            Although this will not necessarily detract from the pressures for
                            favorable U.S. action on other economic subjects, it will demonstrate
                            that the U.S. is approaching these matters with some flexibility and is
                            prepared to exercise leadership in an important area of <gloss

                        <p>The Treasury Department submits for consideration of the Council the
                            recommendation for U.S. participation in an International Finance
                            Corporation to be organized as an affiliate of the International Bank
                            for Reconstruction and Development to stimulate private investment by
                            making loans without member government guarantee along the lines
                            indicated below.</p>
                        <p>If the Council concurs, the Chairman would seek approval of the President
                            to consult with Congressional leaders, to enter into discussion with the
                            International Bank and other members, if appropriate, looking to the
                            establishment of the Corporation, and to <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301"

                            appropriate time.</p>
                        <p>The International Finance Corporation would be an intergovernmental body
                            whose basic purpose would be to assist in the development of productive
                            private enterprises in its member countries and to that end to encourage
                            and promote the flow of private capital, domestic and foreign, into such
                            enterprises. The Corporation would emphasize the financing of
                            development projects in under-developed areas. The Corporation would be
                            created by international agreement open to signature by any member of
                            the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>. Membership in <gloss
                                target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> would be a prerequisite to membership
                            in the Corporation.</p>
                        <p>The Corporation’s initial capital would be provided by member countries
                            through subscriptions to its stock. The authorized capital of the
                            Corporation would be $100 million, the subscription of each member
                            country being in proportion to the member’s share in the capital stock
                            of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The U.S.
                            subscription would be approximately $35 million. The Charter would not
                            come into effect until $75 million had been subscribed by a minimum of
                            30 countries.</p>
                        <p>While the capital of the Corporation would be subscribed by governments,
                            the Corporation would be empowered to sell its own obligations in
                            private capital markets without government guarantee as a source of
                            additional funds. The Corporation would also be expected to sell
                            securities from its portfolio to private investors whenever
                            feasible.</p>
                        <p>The Corporation would be empowered to make loans to private enterprise
                            without government guarantee, including debentures bearing interest,
                            payable only if earned, and debentures convertible into stock when
                            purchased from the Corporation by private investors.</p>
                        <p>The Corporation would not provide equity financing as had been discussed
                            in some of the earlier proposals for an International Finance
                            Corporation. It is the view of the President of the International Bank
                            that the features of actual ownership and voting power can be eliminated
                            without seriously handicapping the Corporation.</p>

                                    >Supra</hi></ref>.</note> containing a recommendation for United
                        States participation in an International Finance Corporation. The Chairman
                        remarked that the <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> proposal had been
                        under consideration in the U.S. Government for a considerable period of time
                        and that the present proposal was developed following a request by the
                        United States Delegation to the United Nations for reconsideration of the
                        United States position. <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0329"/>He noted
                        that the <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> proposal had been considerably
                        improved by the elimination of the provision for equity financing, and
                        outlined the procedure contemplated. If the Council approved the proposal in
                        principle, Treasury would request Presidential approval and then consult
                        with interested Congressional leaders. A public announcement of the
                        intention of the Administration to submit the proposal to the Congress would
                        be made prior to the Rio Conference.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Waugh stated that the Department of State was willing to support the
                        present proposal, largely because of the importance to the United States of
                        avoiding a perpetual negative position. State also agreed with the procedure
                        outlined by the Chairman. He felt that announcement of the <gloss
                            target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> proposal might forestall a Latin American
                        proposal at the Rio Conference for an Inter-American Development Bank.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Martin stated that he remained unconvinced that the <gloss
                            target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> proposal had economic merit and he doubted
                        the need under present conditions for an additional international
                        institution of this type. He also felt that the <gloss target="#t_IFC1"
                            >IFC</gloss> might raise problems with respect to the operations of the
                        Export-Import Bank and the International Bank. He indicated, however, that
                        if the Council felt it necessary to approve the proposal on political
                        grounds, he would not oppose it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Anderson indicated approval of the principle of the proposal and
                        suggested that the Corporation might reasonably begin business after $50
                        million have been subscribed of the currencies most valuable for lending
                        purposes, rather than waiting for subscriptions of $75 million and 30
                        members. He also favored, as a means of emphasizing its experimental
                        character, provision for automatic liquidation of the <gloss
                            target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> after 5 years unless two-thirds of the
                        members voted for continuation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hall stated that Governor Stassen is in favor of the <gloss
                            target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> proposal, and suggested that more
                        flexibility in the kinds of securities operations envisaged for the <gloss
                            target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> would be desirable. He also felt that a
                        limit on authorized capital higher than $100 million would be desirable, to
                        simplify any necessary later increases in the capital of the Corporation,
                        and he felt that 5 years would be too short a period to judge whether the
                        Corporation would be effective.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stambaugh stated that the Export-Import Bank is opposed to the <gloss
                            target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> proposal on substantive grounds but
                        recognizes the political factors in the situation. He expressed concern
                        about the relationship of an <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> to the
                        Export-Import Bank, and felt that the Council should be clearly on record
                        that the <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> would in no way interfere with
                        the operations of the Export-Import Bank. Mr. Lodwick expressed agreement
                        with the proposal, but emphasized that the Department of Agriculture
                        likewise wished to be certain that <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0330"
                        />the <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> not interfere with the operations
                        of the Export-Import Bank.</p>
                    <p>There followed a thorough discussion of the relationships of the <gloss
                            target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> with the established lending institutions.
                        The Council noted that the <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> was designed
                        to fill a different role than either the Export-Import Bank or the <gloss
                            target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>. Accordingly, the Council agreed
                        unanimously that the Corporation should be regarded as supplementing, and
                        not competing with, or having any priority over, the Export-Import Bank and
                        the International Bank. Thus the Corporation would not affect the activities
                        of the Export-Import Bank in aiding in financing and facilitating the
                        exports and imports of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brundage indicated that the Bureau of the Budget was not enthusiastic
                        over the proposal but that the removal of the provision for equity financing
                        improved it considerably. He inquired concerning the method of providing the
                        U.S. subscription. The Chairman replied that the funds would have to be
                        authorized by the Congress, probably along the lines that funds were
                        provided for the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> subscriptions.</p>
                    <p>In reply to the Chairman’s question about the position of the <gloss
                            target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>’s Board on the <gloss target="#t_IFC1"
                            >IFC</gloss> proposal, Mr. Overby stated that the Executive Board of the
                        Bank had at no time given its approval to the <gloss target="#t_IFC1"
                            >IFC</gloss> proposal. It had merely decided that the management on its
                        own responsibility could submit reports to <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                            >ECOSOC</gloss>. He emphasized that no decision on the policy of the
                        United States had been given to the Bank’s management, though there had been
                        discussions about the form of the proposal.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Overby requested that great caution be exercised in discussing the
                        proposal to avoid premature public knowledge of it, pointing out that the
                        matter of timing of the announcement was considered important.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Waugh wished to make it clear that any action which the Council might now
                        take would be on the principle rather than the details of the <gloss
                            target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> proposal, which might require further
                        study. He agreed that the functions of the Export-Import Bank must be
                        continued as they had in the past and recognized that the creation of the
                            <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> would involve additional problems of
                        coordination between the two banks. Since Congress had given a mandate to
                        the Council to coordinate these activities, the Council had special reason
                        to scrutinize the proposal and its implications with great care.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of this phase of the discussion, the Council agreed to
                        approve the proposal in principle and to approve the procedure for
                        implementation as submitted, subject to the understanding previously reached
                        with respect to the functions of the Export-Import Bank and the <gloss
                            target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>.</p>
                    <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0331"/>
                    <p>The following action was taken (Action No. 748): <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The National Advisory Council approves in principle U.S.
                                participation in an International Finance Corporation to be
                                organized as an affiliate of the International Bank for
                                Reconstruction and Development, for the purpose of promoting private
                                investment by making loans without member government guarantees. The
                                capital of the Corporation would be set at $100 million, with a U.S.
                                subscription of about $35 million. It is understood that the
                                Corporation would not directly provide equity financing, and that it
                                would supplement and would not compete with or have any priority
                                over the Export-Import Bank or the International
                        Bank.”</p></quote></p>
                    <p>The Chairman then invited discussion on specific aspects of the proposal. The
                        discussion dealt primarily with appropriate means for re-examination of the
                            <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> after a reasonable period, as
                        suggested by Mr. Anderson. There was general agreement that the <gloss
                            target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss> should be regarded as experimental and that
                        therefore some means should be adopted to raise the question, after a time,
                        of whether it should be continued. Mr. Waugh stated that he was very dubious
                        that the provision for review should be a part of the charter of the <gloss
                            target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss>. After discussion, the Council instructed
                        the Staff Committee to outline the several alternate possibilities. The
                        Council also noted that exploration of this question with the management of
                        the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> would eventually be
                            necessary.<note n="2" xml:id="d95fn2">At the 220th meeting of the

                    <p>On December 12, 1946, the Council decided to give blanket U.S. approval to
                        the use of the entire 18% contribution of the U.S. ($571.5 million) for
                        loans. (Action No. 104, December 12, 1946)<note n="6" xml:id="d96fn6">Not

                            “Actions”)</note> This decision was taken in the light of a staff paper
                        which expressed the view that it would be unwise, as a matter of policy, for
                        the U.S. to seek to review individual loans through its veto power over the
                        use of its 18% contribution. Only Ecuador, El Salvador and Honduras, in
                        addition to the United States, have given the Bank blanket authority to use
                        their 18% contributions for loans. The use of limited amounts of currency
                        has been agreed to by Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Guatemala, Italy,
                        Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Paraguay, and the United Kingdom. Certain other
                        members of the Bank have indicated their willingness to consider releases at
                        such time as particular cases arise. The bulk of the loans made by the Bank
                        thus far have been disbursed in U.S. currency, either from the 18%
                        contribution, or from funds raised by borrowing in the American market,
                        although small amounts of other currencies have been made available and
                        advanced to borrowers.</p>
                    <p>Principal repayments on and the proceeds of portfolio sales of loans
                        originally made from the U.S. 18% contribution have been accumulating, and
                        the Bank now holds about $6 million in such funds. This amount is neither
                        being loaned nor invested, while the proceeds of the Bank’s bond issues are
                        invested in short-term U.S. obligations until needed for operations. Hence,
                        the Bank would prefer to meet its current requirements with recovered 18%
                        funds rather than with the proceeds of its bond issues.</p>
                    <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0334"/>
                    <p>The considerations which dictated giving blanket approval to the Bank for use
                        of the original 18% contribution would appear to argue for a similar blanket
                        approval for the relending of all recoveries of principal on loans made with
                        such funds. However, the context of that decision is not the same as the
                        situation today. The failure of most of the members of the Bank to give
                        general approval to the use of their 18% contributions suggests the
                        desirability of placing some limit on the further blanket authorization
                        sought by the Bank at this time. While a requirement that the use of such
                        recovered funds be subject to U.S. approval, loan by loan, would doubtless
                        make the Bank’s task more difficult in securing greater cooperation from its
                        other members, a time limit on the U.S. approval for re-loaning recovered
                        18% funds might have a salutary effect in stimulating greater cooperation by
                        other members of the Bank. Accordingly, it is proposed that the Bank’s
                        request be granted for a period of approximately one year so that the
                        situation can be reviewed again near the end of 1952.<note n="7"

                            the rate reaches 3½ percent per annum would be for the agreed purpose of
                            arriving at appropriate arrangements to ensure complete repurchase
                            within five years of the original drawing. With respect to so-called
                            gold-tranche drawings, the Fund would request members to agree on a
                            schedule of repurchases so that all amounts outstanding at the end of
                            three years would be repurchased by the end of five years of the
                            original drawing. These decisions having been taken, members <pb n="310"

                    </list>
                    <p>The Treasurer of the United States has on deposit in various countries
                        throughout the world foreign currencies acquired under Lend Lease
                        Settlements, Surplus Property Agreements and other sources, and periodically
                        receives accelerated payments in foreign currencies against these
                        agreements.</p>
                    <p>Since fiscal year 1948, as a matter of policy, the Department has acquired
                        large quantities of foreign currencies from the Treasury by purchase with
                        appropriated dollars. This action has resulted in either the reduction of
                        balances held by the Treasurer or the reduction of the indebtedness of a
                        foreign government to the United States and simultaneously payment of U.S.
                        dollars into miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury rather than into the
                        economy of the countries involved.</p>
                    <p>Although the Department is not required by law to purchase all foreign
                        currencies from Treasury, provision of our current appropriation requires
                        the purchase of $7,500,000 in foreign currencies from Treasury.</p>
                    <p>The exchange rates at which foreign currencies are acquired by the Department
                        have a bearing on the Department’s expenses. It therefore is essential that
                        realistic values be obtained wherever available.</p>
                    <p>The Treasury Department policy on sales of its foreign currency
                        availabilities, except in certain Iron Curtain countries, has been one of
                        adherence to official or officially sanctioned rates even <pb n="311"
                            xml:id="pg_311" facs="0337"/>though such transactions are strictly an
                        internal U.S. Government matter.</p>
                    <p>During recent months, disparities have developed between the exchange rates
                        maintained officially, with respect to many currencies, and local curb
                        markets, cross rates available in other countries or through other
                        arrangements. The latter rates represent more realistic values with relation
                        to the buying power of the U.S. dollar. Specific examples of countries in
                        this category are Austria, France, Italy, Norway, Greece, Egypt and India
                        where the Department’s foreign currency needs are acquired by purchase from
                        the Treasury at rates maintained officially. It is estimated that a
                        potential annual savings of $1,500,000 can be effected in these seven
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>In order that the Department may obtain realistic dollar values for the
                        appropriated dollars used to procure local currencies, it is proposed that
                        Treasury be approached and urged to meet the available markets not currently
                        recognized in those instances where such markets represent realistic
                        exchange rates with relation to the U.S. dollar.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Willis stated that the question of stand-by arrangements arises in
                        connection with the Fund meeting in Mexico City<note n="1" xml:id="d100fn1"
                            >Reference is to the Seventh Annual Meeting of the Boards of Governors
                            of the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and the <gloss

                            (Washington, 1952).</note> because the Managing Director of the Fund has
                        indicated his desire to make an announcement on this subject at the
                        beginning of the meetings. The question has been discussed in two meetings
                        of the Staff Committee and in the Fund Executive Board, although no action
                        has been taken there. The Fund staff had originally recommended that
                        stand-by arrangements be made available for fairly long periods (up to 18
                        months), and that they constitute, in effect, a guaranty that a country
                        would be able to draw during the period covered. The Fund staff had also
                        raised the question of whether a commitment fee should be charged whether or
                        not an actual drawing was made.</p>
                    <p>After thorough discussion with the U.S. Executive Director, the Staff
                        Committee is proposing to the Council that the draft decision now being
                        considered in the Fund should be amended in some respects. The document
                        before the Council (<gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Document No.
                            1365<note n="2" xml:id="d100fn2"><ref target="#d99"><hi rend="italic"
                                    >Supra</hi></ref>.</note>) indicated the changes that in the
                        opinion of the Staff Committee the U.S. Executive Director should introduce
                        in the Fund. Mr. Willis explained that the first suggested change would make
                        clear that, in considering any request for stand-by arrangement or a renewal
                        of a stand-by arrangement, the Fund would apply the same policies as are
                        applied to a request for an immediate drawing, “including consideration of
                        the performance of the member in making progress in achieving the objectives
                        and purposes of the Fund and in carrying out agreed programs of action.” The
                        Staff Committee feels that since a stand-by arrangement would in effect
                        commit the Fund in advance to make actual drawings, any decision adopted by
                        the Fund should specify clearly the tests that would be applied. The second
                        suggestion, Mr. Willis continued, concerns the time period of such
                        arrangements. The Fund staff now recommends that stand-by arrangements be
                        “generally” limited to periods of not more than six months. The Staff
                        Committee and the U.S. Executive <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0341"
                        />Director suggest that the word “generally” be deleted to indicate clearly
                        that stand-by arrangements would be limited to not more than six months.</p>
                    <p>In addition to those suggestions, the Staff Committee has agreed that a flat
                        charge of ⅛ of 1 percent for a stand-by arrangement and for each renewal
                        would be appropriate. Mr. Willis concluded by observing that while
                        considerations relating to a member’s formal ineligibility to draw might
                        conceivably stop on actual drawing by a member which had received a stand-by
                        arrangement, such cases would in practice be extremely rare.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Southard referred to his two memoranda (<gloss target="#t_NAC1"

                            files, lot 60 D 137, “Staff Documents”)</note>) on this subject, and
                        stated that the development of stand-by arrangements appeared to be
                        desirable, provided that the safeguards indicated above were adopted. It has
                        not been possible, he continued, to ignore the feeling of a number of Fund
                        members that they do not know where they stand with respect to the use of
                        the Fund’s resources and therefore cannot make plans ahead which might
                        include assistance from the Fund. These members feel that they cannot find
                        out where they stand unless they request an actual drawing. In many cases,
                        so they argue, they do not want actually to draw at a given moment. They
                        might not be able to cite that they have a present need for the money, but
                        they would like to know whether they could count on a Fund drawing if the
                        need should materialize. The stand-by arrangement would mean that a country
                        that would like to count on the use of the Fund’s resources can find out
                        whether it will be able to draw if it needs a drawing. In bankers’
                        terminology, it would involve a virtually irrevocable line of credit. There
                        are certain provisions whereby the right to draw could be terminated or
                        suspended, for example through technical ineligibility of a country, but the
                        arrangement would in practice be sufficiently irrevocable to meet the needs
                        of these member countries. Mr. Southard pointed out the similarity between
                        the proposed stand-by arrangements and the arrangements which had recently
                        been worked out for Belgium.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Southard continued that the proposal is a proper development of Fund
                        policy. However, it contains some element of calculated risk, like the gold
                        tranche policy which the Council previously approved. Mr. Southard thought,
                        however, that the gold tranche policy involved greater risks than the
                        present proposal in that it in fact deprives the Council of a meaningful
                        review of gold tranche <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0342"/>drawings.
                        The stand-by arrangement proposal does not eliminate Council review, but
                        rather gives the United States every opportunity it would want to scrutinize
                        every request for a stand-by arrangement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Southard thought that this particular version of the stand-by proposal
                        will not be welcomed by a number of Executive Directors. Some will say it
                        goes too far, some that it doesn’t go far enough, and especially that six
                        months is not a long enough period. Some may believe that the proposal
                        provides so little that it would be a mistake to publicize it. Mr. Southard
                        thought that the U.S. Government would not want to publicize it if there was
                        a lack of enthusiasm for it, and that it would be unwise to press it further
                        if the arrangement did not seem to please the majority of the Board.
                        However, Mr. Rooth is willing to try this approach.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman expressed the view that everyone present realized there were
                        some features of the arrangement they would prefer to have different, but
                        that it was desirable to increase the flexibility of the operations of the
                        Fund. Such an arrangement could present some problems, since it departs to
                        some extent from the initial conception of the Fund. He concluded, however,
                        that present circumstances appear to call for progressive development of
                        Fund policies.</p>
                    <p>Without further discussion, the Council approved the draft Fund decision on
                        stand-by arrangements as submitted.</p>

                        utilize this opportunity to improve the usefulness of the resources now
                        controlled by this agency. The Fund was established to overcome trade
                        restrictions and currency instability. Its purposes were intended to be to
                        deal with temporary balance of payments difficulties. But it is obvious that
                        these purposes are unrealistic as the world has developed since Bretton
                        Woods in 1944 and that the purposes of the Fund have become largely
                        obsolescent due to world conditions. The following circumstances bear out
                        this conclusion.</p>

                            and intensify these restrictions and controls.” At the moment the Fund

                    <p>It seems clear that those of us who are deeply interested in United States
                        leadership in international cooperation must be alert to situations of this
                        character before the opponents of cooperation get hold of them and misuse
                        them as arguments against such cooperation. The International Bank has on
                        the whole had an effective and useful career. Its operations have been much
                        more limited than they should be, considering the needs for the development
                        of the underdeveloped areas and the rehabilitation of war-torn economies but
                        the capital with which it has operated, though inadequate, has been well and
                        effectively used as far as it has gone. The same cannot be said of the Fund.
                        This agency has not met the expectations of Bretton Woods or of the Congress
                        when it approved Bretton Woods and authorized the United States to join the
                        Fund. It has not satisfied the international community who are its members
                        and the events of the last five years and the foreseeable future have
                        largely invalidated any such limited role of a great international
                        institution as “financing temporary balance of payments deficits on current
                        account for monetary stabilization operations”. Sufficient time has now
                        elapsed in the course of the annual meetings so that the attitude of the
                        other members can have been ascertained and I believe at this time the
                        United States representatives should come forward with much more
                        far-reaching proposals than they have already made. I commend the following
                        to you therefore—</p>
                    <p>An effort should be made to put the resources of the Fund to much greater use
                        than they are put to now for the purposes of <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319"
                            facs="0345"/>world peace and stability. Accordingly the United States
                        representatives should sponsor a resolution to call a conference for the
                        amendment of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund and the Bank with a view
                        either (a) to consolidate the Fund and the Bank; or (b) to enable the Fund
                        to operate in developing greater international trade through clearance and
                        financing facilities. I think that the consolidation of the Fund and the
                        Bank is the wiser and more effective course.</p>
                    <p>A merger of the Fund and the Bank I have been advocating since 1949 and I
                        believe it more pertinent than ever now. The European Recovery Program has
                        come to an end with the fiscal year ending June 30, 1952 and for the fiscal
                        year 1952–53 the United States is engaged in the Mutual Security Program.
                        Under this program the emphasis is upon military assistance and this is
                        shown by the fact that of the appropriations for foreign aid for this fiscal
                        year over 90% are for military assistance and under 10% are for economic and
                        technical assistance. The International Bank will now have a much bigger
                        role to play in the development of underdeveloped areas and the
                        rehabilitation of war-torn economies still presenting such difficulties in
                        so many parts of the world. This is a vital phase of the struggle of all the
                        free peoples against totalitarianisms and this is the time to enormously
                        strengthen the Bank for its mission.</p>
                    <p>I urge upon you action as aforesaid and would very much appreciate your views
                        as soon as possible.</p>

                    <p>The sessions of the Governors of the International Monetary Fund at Mexico
                        City indicated greater interest than ever before in <pb n="320"
                            xml:id="pg_320" facs="0346"/>the Fund itself and in the problems which
                        fall within the scope of its Articles of Agreement. The fact that the Fund
                        operates in a difficult field in which governments hold strong views on such
                        related questions as internal economic policy, exchange policy, and trade
                        policy serve to emphasize the importance of the institution and its
                        work.</p>
                    <p>The Fund and the International Bank stress the importance of maintaining an
                        international economic system in which trade, exchange and international
                        investment are free from restrictions and controls. In my opinion,
                        inadequate recognition has been given to the unpublicized work which the
                        Fund has done in trying to get its members to curb inflationary policies and
                        to follow sound budget, credit, and investment practices.</p>
                    <p>Your letter suggests as one alternative that the Fund’s Articles might be
                        amended to enable it “to operate in developing greater international trade
                        through clearance and financing facilities.” The National Advisory Council,
                        after full consideration, has recently expressed its view in its Third
                        Special Report to the Congress, that “The Articles of Agreement admit of the
                        degree of flexibility necessary to adapt operations and policies of the Fund
                        to changing conditions, and, accordingly, the Council does not recommend any
                        amendments at this time.” There was no indication at Mexico City that any
                        other government favored a different view. In the course of the past year
                        the Executive Board—with the active participation of the U.S.
                        Director—continued its review of policies and procedures for making
                        available the use of the Fund’s resources for short-term assistance to
                        members in achieving Fund objectives. On the whole, the Governors at Mexico
                        City expressed considerable satisfaction with the progress which the Fund
                        had made in this direction. The National Advisory Council, through the U.S.
                        Executive Director, has supported the Fund’s course in this program.</p>
                    <p>Your letter also repeats the suggestion of consolidating the Fund and the
                        Bank. In replies to your earlier letters on this subject it has been pointed
                        out that the Bank, which derives its loanable funds for the most part from
                        the sale of its bonds, has not to the present time had any difficulty in
                        raising funds for its loan purposes by the sale of its securities in the
                        United States market. Additional securities have been sold as the Bank has
                        required funds for lending purposes. Accordingly, it does not seem necessary
                        to add to the Bank’s capital at this time. The National Advisory Council
                        fully sympathizes with the objectives of economic development and technical
                        assistance, but it does not believe that a merger of the Fund and the Bank
                        is necessary or desirable as a means to this end.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">1. <hi rend="italic">Interest Rates on U.S. Government
                            Foreign Loans</hi></p>
                    <p>The Chairman introduced the subject of the meeting and asked Mr. Burgess to
                        outline the problem for the members of the Council.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Burgess stated that interest rates have been rising for some time,
                        fundamentally because of conditions of supply and demand in the money
                        market. He described the very heavy demand for funds so far in the first
                        half of 1953 and pointed out that even taking into account the recent rise,
                        the level of interest rates in the market is still low historically. He felt
                        that the level of U.S. Government foreign lending rates had not yet fully
                        adjusted to the conditions of the current tight money market. He noted that
                        the Administration has a philosophy on Government lending different from
                        that of the previous Administration—namely that there should be as little
                        Government lending as possible. Government lending should be restricted to
                        really marginal loans that would not be taken by private <pb n="322"
                            xml:id="pg_322" facs="0348"/>lenders. Obviously, if Government interest
                        rates are lower than interest rates in the private market the Government
                        will be making more loans than it ought to make.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Burgess said that the Staff Committee had explored the problem
                        thoroughly, and as a result of its work, is presenting to the Council two
                        alternative actions with respect to medium and long-term loans to foreign
                        governments or guaranteed by foreign governments or central banks. The first
                        alternative would fix rates on loans of more than two years maturity at 2
                        percent above the current yield of Government securities of comparable
                        terminal maturities, and would result in a rate at the present time of about
                        5 percent on 20-year loans. The second alternative, which would be a
                        continuation of past policy, would increase rates to cover the recent
                        increase in the cost of money to the Government, and would result in a
                        current rate of about 4¼ percent on 20-year loans.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Overby noted that the differences of opinion in the Staff Committee
                        related only to paragraph 1 (a) and 1 (b) of the recommended action. He
                        understood that some agency representatives in the Staff Committee had
                        preferred alternative 1. (b) rather than 1 (a), but he was not sure whether
                        these staff views represented the opinions of the Council members. There was
                        no disagreement in the Staff Committee with respect to paragraphs 2 and
                        3.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman stated that the question before the Council was the adoption of
                        either 1 (a) or 1 (b), in addition to paragraphs 2 and 3, with the thought
                        that the rate would be adjusted from time to time if necessary.</p>
                    <p>General Edgerton commented that there was some difference of opinion within
                        the Export-Import Bank on the matter, but that he preferred alternative 1
                        (b), on the understanding that it would provide a floor for interest rates
                        and would not preclude higher rates than indicated by the formula. He
                        observed that Export-Import Bank loans are made with varying objectives in
                        mind, and that in the case of some of these loans it would not be expedient
                        or in the best interests of the United States to be bound by a rigid
                        interest rate formula. He felt that because of the importance of the special
                        considerations sometimes involved in Export-Import Bank loans, alternative 1
                        (a) was somewhat too rigid. The adoption of alternative 1 (b), viewed as a
                        floor to interest rates, would preserve the necessary degree of
                        flexibility.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Burgess asked General Edgerton what effect the adoption of alternative 1
                        (b) would have on Export-Import Bank rates in relation to International Bank
                        rates. General Edgerton replied that if Export-Import Bank rates were set at
                        the floor, they would be lower than International Bank rates. This would be
                        the case where the special considerations are important. For example, he
                        referred <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0349"/>to the development of
                        strategic material production as a defense objective in which the U.S. has a
                        special interest which would justify lower rates by the Export-Import
                        Bank.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman advanced the view that in most cases Export-Import Bank rates
                        ought to be as high as International Bank rates. General Edgerton agreed
                        with this view. Mr. Overby pointed out that alternative 1 (a) would bring
                        the rates of the two institutions to approximate equality.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman was of the opinion that the rule adopted should deal with the
                        most commonly occurring cases, and that under special circumstances
                        exceptions to the rule could be made. This would be preferable to the
                        adoption of a rule that would cover the exceptional cases but not the usual
                        cases. With this understanding, General Edgerton stated that he had no
                        important reservations to alternative 1 (a).</p>
                    <p>Mr. Phleger stated that the Department of State preferred alternative 1 (a)
                        and felt that exceptional cases in which lower interest rates are indicated
                        ought to be handled as they arise. Secretary Weeks also favored alternative
                        1 (a), and added that Export-Import Bank and International Bank rates should
                        be equal. Mr. Martin joined in supporting alternative 1 (a) and felt that,
                        on the whole, it is better to make downward rather than upward exceptions if
                        necessary. There was general agreement that the rates of the Export-Import
                        and International Banks should be approximately equal except in unusual
                        cases.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman then proposed that the Council adopt alternative 1 (a) with the
                        understanding that exceptional cases in which lower interest rates were
                        indicated would be treated as they arose, and that the Council also adopt
                        paragraphs 2 and 3 of the recommended action. The proposal was adopted
                        unanimously. General Edgerton, referring to paragraph 2 of the action,
                        called attention to the last sentence, which expressly recognizes one kind
                        of special circumstance that sometimes arises with Export-Import Bank
                        loans.</p>

                                loans under present circumstances). Loans not guaranteed by
                                governments should continue to be made at rates at least ½ to 1

                    <p>Mr. Anderson referred to page 2, paragraph 6, of the paper, concerning the
                        continuation of a differential of ½ to 1 percent on loans made to private
                        entities without government guarantee. He stated his understanding that this
                        paragraph was not intended to fix a rigid spread between guaranteed and
                        unguaranteed loans. Rather, he understood that in the case of unguaranteed
                        loans to private entities, the differential from the guaranteed loan rate
                        might be higher and would be based on the credit standing of the borrower.
                        The Chairman said that it ought to cost more to borrow from the Government
                        than from private sources, so that there would be a penalty on borrowing
                        from the Government. Mr. Burgess observed that the differential noted in the
                        paper between guaranteed and unguaranteed loans should be regarded as a
                        floor, and that in some cases the differential might be much higher than 1
                        percent.</p>

                    <p>As stated in the Act of Congress,<note n="2" xml:id="d104fn2">Reference is to
                            the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (Public Law 173), approved July 31,
                            1945; for text, see 59 Stat. 526.</note> the purpose of the
                        Export-Import Bank is “to aid in financing and to facilitate exports and
                        imports and the exchange of commodities between the United States or any of
                        its territories or insular possessions and any foreign country or the

                        made for the purpose of facilitating the foreign trade of the United States.
                        With only minor exceptions, all of the approximately $4 billion disbursed as
                        loans by the Bank since 1934 have been expended in the United States for
                        manufactured products, commodities or services of United States
                        manufacturers, agriculturalists, and suppliers.</p>
                    <p>The questions to be considered at all times are: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    <p>To all who have analyzed this situation it is obvious that this country is
                        not concerned primarily with the ability of the United States exporters to
                        make sales of United States goods, except, perhaps, in special instances
                        like surplus agricultural commodities. The real problem is the ability of
                        the foreign countries to pay for these goods—to obtain enough dollars to buy
                        as much from the United States as they desire. Generally since the first
                        World War, the United States, as a creditor country with the greatest
                        production capacity ever known in the world and with more than the average
                        supply of natural resources basic to a strong economy, has exported more
                        than it has imported. For many years the difference was made up principally
                        through the shipment of gold until the United States had accumulated most of
                        the world’s monetary gold stores. During and since the last war the
                        difference has been met through gifts of one form or another or through
                        dollar credits.</p>
                    <p>From the earliest days of the Bank it was recognized by the management that
                        the alleviation of our trade problems does not lie in the mere extension of
                        credit. We can solve nothing merely by inducing the rest of the world to
                        expand “installment buying.” What is bought today on credit must be paid for
                        tomorrow. If the equipment which is purchased abroad does not lead to
                        increases in productive capacity of the borrowing country, the “trade base”
                        for the future has not been expanded. The management of the Export-Import
                            <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0352"/>Bank is, therefore, following
                        the policy of financing exports on a selective rather than on an overall
                        basis. That is to say, it has restricted its assistance generally to the
                        financing of those products of U.S. origin which will increase the
                        productive capacity of the foreign country receiving them. In certain
                        instances where the foreign country is suffering from a persistent and
                        chronic dollar shortage an additional test may be necessary; that is, that
                        the equipment should enable the foreign country to earn or save dollars.
                        Even in this instance the dollar earning or saving effect need not be
                        direct—it is sufficient that incorporation of such items into the economy of
                        the country indirectly improves its foreign exchange position.</p>
                    <p>It might be pointed out that the problem of the United States in foreign
                        trade is just the opposite of the problem of Great Britain. It is the
                        constant problem of Great Britain to sell enough abroad to earn the foreign
                        exchange with which to purchase the food, raw materials, and even certain
                        manufactured products required to maintain its island economy. The more that
                        Britain can sell on credit the stronger is the British trade and economy.
                        Great Britain’s problem is to sell enough abroad. Our problem is to get paid
                        for what we sell. There would be no end to the credit which the
                        Export-Import Bank would have the opportunity to extend nor to the number of
                        orders which United States exporters could write were the Export-Import Bank
                        to abandon the policy of careful “selective” financing of exports in favor
                        of making public credit easily available to all exporters who might find it
                        possible to increase their sales by the extension of credit terms to their
                        foreign customers.</p>
                    <p>The idea of “selective” financing of exports is not based on any premise or
                        implication that it is more important to the United States to export one
                        type of article than another. The manufacture and sale of gadgets and
                        so-called luxury items is as important to the overall economy of the United
                        States as the manufacture of capital equipment and the production of food
                        and raw materials. If, however, the limited public funds available for such
                        purpose through the Export-Import Bank are used to finance the export of
                        that type of equipment which will increase basic productive facilities, the
                        foreign country eventually will be able to buy not only capital equipment,
                        but also the many other items that go to make up a higher standard of
                        living. For example, the Export-Import Bank might be prepared to finance the
                        sale of ore cars or freight cars to a particular country, but not prepared
                        to finance the export of the latest passenger car equipment to the same
                        country. If the ore or freight cars are used to transport to the seaboard
                        products and minerals required in the United States then the country will
                            <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0353"/>create wealth not only to pay
                        for those industrial purpose cars, but also sufficient to purchase such
                        passenger equipment as it may need over the coming years. If, however, we
                        should use up the credit of the other country through the sale of the latest
                        type club cars and sleepers, the result is obvious, and can hardly be
                        justified by the desire of the United States exporter to make the particular
                        sale.</p>
                    <p>There can be no hard and fast rule. Basic economic conditions in the world
                        change rapidly. The dollar problem harassing world trade today may be less
                        severe tomorrow. Many countries have always been exceptions to any chronic
                        and persistent dollar shortage rule. Equipment which serves a productive
                        purpose in one country may not serve such a purpose in another. Equipment
                        which would be only a luxury in one country may become a necessity to the
                        economic life and productive capacity of another community. The management
                        of the Export-Import Bank is convinced that its financing must be such as to
                        improve trade between the United States and foreign countries rather than
                        merely to make next year’s sale a year early.</p>
                    <p>Nor should the rule be applied with absolute rigidity. Certain United States
                        producers and manufacturers are constantly dependent upon foreign markets to
                        maintain operations. Our cotton and wheat growers consistently have an
                        exportable surplus. Manufacturers of such items as machine tools, farm
                        implements, and textile machinery depend upon foreign markets for the sale
                        of from 30% to 50% of their annual production. From the standpoint of the
                        importing country such products and equipment often supply a legitimate
                        economic need even though they may not represent a first priority capital
                        development.</p>
                    <p>In these instances in which the particular foreign order is of more than
                        ordinary importance to the United States suppliers, or serves some more
                        general important U.S. interest, the Bank takes such considerations into
                        account, although it is still required that importation of the product or
                        item serve a useful economic purpose and lay no undue burden upon the
                        exchange position of the importing country.</p>
                    <p>In carrying out these principles the Bank has extended loans generally of the
                        following types: <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>The Bank has participated with United States suppliers and
                                exporters in the financing of a particular order for goods of a
                                productive character. By participation we mean that the Bank has
                                agreed to carry anywhere from 50% to 90% of the credit extended to
                                the foreign purchaser—either private or public—without recourse to
                                the United States supplier, who will himself carry the remaining
                                portion of the credit on his own or with the assistance of <pb
                                    n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0354"/>his commercial bank. Such
                                credits are necessary to fill the void existing in private capital
                                markets for the financing of foreign trade. They serve to place
                                American exporters on an equal footing with the exporters of those
                                foreign countries whose governments have taken steps through export
                                credit insurance or similar devices, to fill this gap in private
                                credit facilities. The sale of heavy capital equipment generally
                                creates a future market for the supplier in the form of spare parts,
                                replacements, and additions. By requesting the supplier to
                                participate, the Bank is assured that the order is one of importance
                                to the supplier, that the supplier has been careful in selecting a
                                foreign purchaser who is credit worthy and that the supplier
                                continues to be interested in the successful operation of his
                                product during the period that the foreign purchaser is making
                                payment.</item>

                            <item>The Export-Import Bank has consistently financed the exportation
                                of cotton and other agricultural commodities and certain types of
                                equipment and machinery produced in the United States which are
                                dependent upon foreign markets and which are important to the
                                continued economic life of the foreign country.</item>

                            <item>The Bank has extended credits to United States companies, to
                                private interests abroad and to Governments abroad to assist in
                                financing high priority investment projects which will improve the
                                basic productive capacity of the importing country. Of most direct
                                benefit to foreign trade is the financing of the development of
                                minerals and other strategic materials and commodities which are
                                required in the United States and will find a ready market in
                                dollars. For example, a group of strategic material credits
                                authorized in Latin America during the past 2 years will require
                                loans of less than $100 million, but will result eventually in
                                earnings to the countries concerned of approximately $50 million per
                                year, all of which may be used for the purchase of United States
                                products, after the repayment of the loans. Of more indirect, but
                                equally important benefit has been the financing of roads, harbors,
                                electric power installations, irrigation projects and a few basic
                                and secondary industries. It is only after a country has been opened
                                up by the presence of such basic installations that its resources
                                can be brought into world trade and private investors can be induced
                                to establish new businesses and industries. Again it should be
                                pointed out that credits made available abroad to finance such
                                projects are made for the purpose of meeting dollar requirements of
                                such projects, i.e., the funds are available for the acquisition of
                                the equipment and services which are to be purchased in the United
                                States. There are few United States suppliers and manufacturers,
                                large or small, that have not benefited through the sale of material
                                of one type or another, as the result of credits of this type
                                heretofore extended by the Export-Import Bank. Such sales were made
                                without the necessity of the United States exporter incurring any
                                credit risk abroad and in many cases without his knowledge that the
                                sale resulted from Export-Import Bank financing.</item>

                            <item>The Bank has extended credits in special circumstances to meet

                                the Defense Department of the United States, thus making exchange
                                available to France for the continued importation of raw materials
                                and equipment from the United States.</item>

                                been to further political objectives of the U.S. Government. In no
                                such instance, however, can the Bank overlook the requirements of
                                its legislation and policies that the loan be economically
                                justifiable and conducive to sound international trade.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>All of the foregoing is subject to the policy of the Bank—expressed in its
                        Act as the policy of the Congress—that the Bank in the exercise of its
                        functions would supplement and encourage and not compete with private
                        capital, and that loans so far as possible consistent with carrying out the
                        purposes of the Act, shall generally be for specific purposes and in the
                        judgment of the Board of Directors offer reasonable assurance of
                        repayment.</p>
                    <p>In addition to making the finding with respect to reasonable assurance of
                        repayment, the management of the Bank must reach a conclusion that private
                        financing is not available for the accomplishment of the purposes before a
                        credit is approved. Numerous requests which would otherwise qualify for
                        loans from the Bank have been rejected for the reason that the utilization
                        of public funds for the purpose could not be justified.</p>

                    <p>Mr Willis stated that the Staff Committee had considered the proposed textile
                        machinery credits and had asked the Export-Import Bank for a general paper
                        describing its policies with respect to exporter credits prior to
                        consideration of the specific textile machinery loans. Subsequently the
                        Export-Import Bank paper (<gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Document No.

                        discussed in the Staff Committee and then revised by the Bank. The revised
                        paper, now before the Council, covers not only exporter credits but also the
                        general lending policy of the Bank. In the Staff Committee discussion, Mr.
                        Willis continued, emphasis was placed upon applying the same criteria to
                        exporter credits as to other types of loans. Thus, the balance-of-payments
                        position of the recipient country, its capacity to repay, and the
                        contribution of the loan to its economic development should all be
                        considered in connection with both exporter credits and development loans.
                        Mr. Willis noted that the paper points out the unique position of the United
                        States with respect to foreign lending and observed that one special factor
                        in the textile machinery loans is the domestic situation of the exporting
                        firms. These companies have suffered reduced markets and some degree of
                        unemployment, and are therefore concerned with maintaining sales abroad. He
                        added that the Staff had recommended discussion of the general policy paper
                        and the textile machinery loans at the same time. Mr. Willis concluded by
                        outlining the nature of the loan proposals, emphasizing the significance of
                        an appropriate interest rate (<gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Documents

                    <p>In response to a request from the Chairman, Mr. Sauer amplified some aspects
                        of the general paper and the loan proposals. He called particular attention
                        to the section of the general paper relating to the dependence of certain
                        U.S. producers and manufacturers on foreign markets, and explained that the
                        paper was broader in scope than that requested by the Staff Committee, since
                        the Bank wished to raise with the Council some of the general policy
                        questions of concern to the Bank. He informed the Council that the two
                        Whitin Company loans were first proposed to the Bank last fall, when various
                        companies presented to the Bank an account of falling sales and the view
                        that a large potential market existed in Brazil for textile machinery if
                        financing were available. The Bank had suggested that the companies obtain
                        specific orders for textile machinery and then reapply. The companies
                        returned in April at the time the Bank was involved in extending the $300
                        million credit to Brazil. After considering various proposals, the Bank
                        decided to submit the Whitin credits to the Council, emphasizing (1) the
                        need of the company for the orders, (2) the economic need for textile
                        machinery in Brazil, and (3) the favorable long-run prospects for Brazil.
                        Mr. Sauer concluded by saying that the Bank was convinced there was no
                        domestic financing available to the Whitin Company, that the company did not
                        possess sufficient resources to finance the sales itself, and that if these
                        loans were not forthcoming, Brazil would probably obtain the machinery from
                        other sources.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Anderson commented that the paper is clear and concise, and pointedly
                        raises the policy issues which are of interest. He felt that the Council
                        must carefully consider the basic policy issues involved in exporter
                        credits. Commerce favored the two Whitin loans and considered them justified
                        in the light of the Bank policies stated in the paper, but wished to point
                        out that such loans involve dollar aid supplementary to the well-developed
                        programs of the International Bank and to our own foreign aid program. He
                        noted that other industrial countries assist their exporters to obtain
                        medium-term credits of this sort, and thought that the <gloss
                            target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> should examine the proposal that the U.S.
                        consider making funds available for such exporter credits. He added that he
                        had no information on the magnitude of such funds in other countries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sauer told of another pending exporter credit, for the sale of aircraft
                        in Brazil, involving the desire of the aircraft company to keep U.S.
                        aircraft in the Brazilian civilian market and to keep in operation its
                        production lines for civilian aircraft. He indicated that approval of the
                        Whitin cases would be a precedent for submitting the aircraft loans to the
                        Council.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Waugh agreed with Mr. Anderson that the policy problem must be studied,
                        especially in view of the desire of the United <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332"
                            facs="0358"/>States to promote private investment abroad. He favored
                        granting the Whitin credits pending completion of an overall study but was
                        not convinced that it would be wise to segregate a particular sum for
                        exporter credits. Mr. Anderson called attention to a widely held view that
                        the Export-Import Bank should lend for purposes such as basic development
                        projects in which private investors are not interested. Mr. Overby agreed,
                        saying that the point is frequently made that the Government should stay out
                        of direct competition with private investment and should restrict its
                        activities to projects such as sanitation, port development and the
                        like.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Marget observed that he was disturbed by the concept of exporter credits
                        and felt strongly that two major points need to be settled in the
                        development of a policy toward them: (1) A careful definition of the area to
                        be covered by these credits must be established. This would involve a
                        deliberate finding that a given American industry is in need of this kind of
                        assistance. (2) In view of the fact that exporter credits are in fact
                        credits to the recipient country, we must examine the question of lending to
                        that country just as in the case of other loans. This would mean in each
                        case a positive finding that United States lending to that country is
                        appropriate.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Locker felt that the main point of interest to <gloss target="#t_MSA1"
                            >MSA</gloss> was the problem of tied loans,<note n="3" xml:id="d105fn3"
                            >“Tied loans” are loans with a requirement that the recipient use the
                            proceeds to purchase goods and services from the country making the
                            loan.</note> which he felt should be considered in any examination of
                        Export-Import Bank lending policy. <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> felt
                        that loans should be made by the established lending agencies, but that the
                        Export-Import Bank policy on tied loans leaves a gap in the area of lending
                        possibilities. He concluded that despite the statement in the Export-Import
                        Bank paper that the situation of the recipient country had to be examined,
                        the Council should allow for cases in which overriding reasons may exist for
                        making a loan without regard to the situation of the recipient country.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Waugh felt that if this kind of credit is appropriate for the Bank, the
                        only problem in the Whitin cases is the condition of Brazil. Mr. Sauer
                        explained that the Bank has made a fairly large number of exporter credits
                        in the past but that since the war the amounts have been dwarfed by the much
                        larger amounts of reconstruction and development loans. Mr. Marget inquired
                        whether the Bank would not welcome some protective procedure which might
                        help the Bank in dealing with pressure groups. Mr. Southard noted that the
                        Bank’s procedure is selective and that the Bank has been able to resist
                        pressure in specific cases. He added that in many such cases the Department
                        of Commerce could help the Bank.</p>
                    <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0359"/>
                    <p>Mr. Short expressed his opinion that in foreign lending the feasibility of
                        industrial development and the question of proper balance between industry
                        and agriculture in the borrowing countries need to be carefully weighed, as
                        well as the contribution of the borrowing industry to the economy. From this
                        point of view he could see no objection to the Whitin loans, especially
                        since the Brazilian textile industry is not now self-contained.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Overby indicated that these loans might be closer to the basic functions
                        of the Bank than a number of recent Export-Import Bank loans. Mr. Sauer
                        agreed that this historically is true. Mr. Overby shared Mr. Marget’s
                        concern over the ultimate outcome of the exporter credit proposals.</p>
                    <p>The discussion of the general policy paper continued for some time. Among
                        additional points noted were the fiscal effect in the United States of a
                        large program of exporter credits and the fact that the paper does not deal
                        with some aspects of the broad problem of foreign lending. In concluding the
                        discussion the Council took formal note of the paper and agreed that further
                        consideration would be desirable both by the Staff Committee and the
                        Council. It was agreed accordingly that this subject would be placed on the
                        Council agenda for reexamination at a later date.</p>
                    <p>In response to a question by the Chairman as to the availability of private
                        capital to the Whitin Company, Mr. Sauer stated that the Bank was convinced
                        that private capital for these sales is not available at a reasonable
                        interest rate, and that there is no source of funds in the United States for
                        this kind of credit. It was agreed that approval of the two loans would not
                        be considered a precedent for a general policy of exporter credits, and that
                        until a further study of the general policy problem is completed further
                        exporter credits would not be desirable. The question of an appropriate
                        interest rate was discussed and agreement was reached on 6 percent.</p>

                                <item>Agree with the Fund that monetary reserves are meant to cover
                                    deficits of a country which alternates between temporary deficit
                                    and surplus positions, but is in overall balance during the
                                    course of an “economic cycle” (presumably, a period of

                                    amount would ever be adequate here. Instead, the country
                                    concerned should attempt to bring the imbalance under control
                                    through a proper combination of internal and external

                    <p>In general, reserves should be used only to meet deficits in a country’s
                        balance of payments that are temporary and followed by surpluses of like
                        magnitude. Reserves used for deficits that are not temporary and reversible
                        will of course face the threat of being exhausted. Ordinarily, drafts on
                        reserves are thus appropriate for a country whose external accounts are at
                        least balanced over a period of intermediate length, and whose surplus and
                        deficit phases within the period describe a cycle (or series of cycles) in
                        which the former phases are at least quantitatively equal to the latter.</p>
                    <p>A country with balanced accounts should aim at meeting all temporary
                        deficits—except perhaps those due to depressions abroad—out of its own
                        reserves. On the average, the reserves a country should hold over an
                        “economic cycle” (a period whose duration is not defined in the <gloss
                            target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> paper but might be considered not to exceed
                        2 to 5 years) would be an amount equal to the average temporary deficits
                        incurred during the cycle, plus some margin for miscalculations and some
                        margin to meet psychological needs. Adequate reserves at any given point <hi
                            rend="italic">within</hi> a cycle would of course be different. At a
                        point on a cycle’s deficit phase, adequate reserves would theoretically
                        equal the expected normal drains throughout the portion of the phase that
                        remained; similarly, at a point on the surplus phase they would equal the
                        accretions to reserves expected during the remainder of this swing, minus
                        the full drain of the next deficit phase of the cycle—with some margin for
                        miscalculations and psychological needs.</p>
                    <p>In this latter context, adequate reserves, which would vary over time
                        essentially involve an estimate, therefore, of the outlook for future
                        external balance, and the amplitude of fluctuations within that balance, and
                        cannot be precisely measured. Their size would <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336"
                            facs="0362"/>depend mainly on (1) the seasonal influences affecting the
                        country’s balance of payments, (2) the extraordinary influences that may
                        develop, such as crop failures, and (3) the variability of its import
                        prices, and the prices of, and demand for, its exports.</p>
                    <p>When a country with cyclically balanced accounts is short of reserves in a
                        deficit phase of a cycle, it may appropriately try to make the shortage good
                        by borrowing. It should not, if this can be avoided, impose or intensify
                        restrictions, or pursue deflationary policies to the extent of bringing
                        about severe unemployment.</p>
                    <p>Reference has been made to the need for a country in external balance to aim
                        at meeting out of its own reserves all temporary deficits except perhaps
                        those due to a foreign depression. A country that endeavored to match its
                        outgo and income over time, taking into account a possible heavy excess of
                        outgo over income stemming from a slump abroad, would find itself
                        accumulating more reserves than it would ordinarily require. For most
                        countries this would be very difficult to accomplish under present
                        circumstances. If and when countries that are otherwise in balance fall
                        short of reserves as a result of a slump abroad, it would accordingly seem
                        appropriate for them to turn to the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> for
                        assistance (as suggested in the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> Annual
                        Report for 1952).</p>
                    <p>Attention might be called to the thought expressed in the <gloss
                            target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> paper that for a country in external
                        balance four levels of adequate reserves can be identified, the first three
                        of which, grouped on an ascending scale, would enable the country to
                        maintain restrictions of varying intensity on a parallel descending scale.
                        The implication is that as reserves rise, restrictions can fall.</p>
                    <p>It is misleading to speak of reserves as governing the level of restrictions
                        unless the argument is properly qualified. High reserves may, of course,
                        permit the relaxation of restrictions but such relaxation can be permanent
                        only when future payments prospects indicate a surplus. Where prospects are
                        merely for balance on the basis of existing restrictions, a relaxation
                        cannot be expected to be permanent unless a country adopts other financial
                        measures to maintain its balance. In general, balance-of-payments
                        restrictions are basically determined by a country’s present and prospective
                        trade and payments position, which in turn is a function of its exchange
                        rate, internal financial situation, commercial policy or other
                        considerations that are independent of the level of reserves. In view of the
                        secondary relationship of reserves to restrictions, there would not appear
                        to be a great advantage in dealing with reserves of different magnitudes as
                        being adequate for or consistent with restrictions at different
                        intensities.</p>
                    <p>Reserves of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> levels of adequacy might however be
                        distinguished for a country with balanced external accounts—one level <pb
                            n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0363"/>that is adequate to cover even
                        deficits arising from a depression abroad, and one that is adequate only to
                        cover normal deficits arising in the absence of a disturbance of this
                        type.</p>

                                <item>I have been endeavoring for a good many months to find some
                                    schedule of charges on use of Fund resources which would
                                    increase such charges over the present schedule, and at the same
                                    time would have reasonable prospect of being an acceptable
                                    compromise in the Executive Board of the Fund. The present
                                    schedule of charges is very low for the first tranche and in the
                                    earlier time periods of the second tranche of the quota (see
                                    Attachment II where the existing <hi rend="italic"
                                        >effective</hi> rates are shown). Higher charges would more
                                    adequately reflect the general level of rates in primary money
                                    markets and also would enable the Fund more adequately to pay
                                    its way. However, it must be realized that there will be no
                                    enthusiasm anywhere in the Executive Board of the Fund, aside
                                    from the U.S. Director, for any increase, or at least any
                                    substantial increase, in the schedule of charges.</item>

                                <item>Appended hereto as Attachment I is a proposed new schedule of
                                    charges which I believe might have reasonable prospect of being
                                    accepted in the Executive Board. It sets 2 percent per annum
                                    (effective rate) as the minimum and eliminates the lowest of the
                                    four existing schedules of charges. Attachment II compares this
                                    proposal with the present effective rates. I recommend that I be
                                    authorized to seek the adoption of this new schedule in the
                                    Executive Board of the Fund.</item>

                                    also others) consider that this period is too short to provide
                                    effective stand-by facilities. The United Kingdom Government is
                                    particularly insistent that, in the event of a move to
                                    convertibility of sterling, a stand-by arrangement will be
                                    needed running for not less than 12 months and probably for two
                                    years.</item>

                                    limitation be retained, but that appropriate language be added
                                    to the new decision to indicate that the Fund would give
                                    sympathetic consideration for a longer stand-by arrangement, in
                                    the light of the problem facing the member and the measures
                                    being taken to deal with it. In my view this is an acceptable
                                    modification, possibly with the addition of a phrase to indicate
                                    that the cases where a period longer than six months might be
                                    needed would arise particularly in connection with positive
                                    proposals for convertibility. I recommend that I be authorized
                                    to support a revision of the decision on stand-by credit
                                    arrangements substantially along the above lines. If the United
                                    Kingdom is to go along with this arrangement, it will be
                                    necessary for me to assure the U.K. Director<note n="4"

                                    United States realizes that a six months stand-by arrangement
                                    would not be long enough to serve the needs of the United
                                    Kingdom at the time of a move to convertibility of sterling,
                                    that the United States understands the United Kingdom problem in
                                    this respect, and would be prepared to support a stand-by
                                    arrangement for the United Kingdom for an appropriate period of
                                    time whenever the United States was satisfied that the United

                                <item>As to the commitment fee of ¼ of 1 percent per annum on
                                    stand-by credit arrangements, the Fund Staff recommends that it
                                        <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be levied with respect to the
                                    part of the stand-by arrangement covering gold tranche
                                    transactions. The U.K. Director has urged that the charge itself
                                    be reduced to ⅛ of 1 percent. I do not favor reducing the
                                    charge. However, if the British or others very strongly urge
                                    some reduction, I believe we could agree to an arrangement
                                    whereby the commitment fee would be credited against the other
                                    charges payable to the Fund in proportion to actual drawings
                                    made under a given stand-by arrangement. That is, if in a given
                                    period a member made a drawing amounting to one-fourth of the
                                    total stand-by arrangement, one-fourth of the commitment fee
                                    pertaining to that period would be credited against the charges
                                    resulting from the drawing. For the subsequent period the
                                    stand-by fee would be paid on the unused portion of the stand-by
                                    agreement. As to the Staff recommendation that no charge be
                                    levied with respect to the portion of the stand-by arrangement
                                    covering gold tranche transactions, I think a reasonable case
                                    could be made either way <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0365"

                    <p>There have been two attitudes or schools of thought regarding the restoration
                        of currency convertibility. <list>
                            <label>(a)</label>
                            <item>One school of thought regards the restoration of convertibility as
                                largely a matter of curbing inflation abroad, through the use of
                                appropriate monetary fiscal policies, and of adjusting exchange
                                rates to appropriate levels. If such steps are taken, it is argued,
                                convertibility would be feasible in the near future. This school of
                                thought regards the war-induced disturbances in production and trade
                                as temporary phenomena which have now been surmounted. All that
                                remains for the introduction of convertibility is appropriate
                                monetary-fiscal and exchange rate policies.</item>
                            <label>(b)</label>
                            <item>Another school of thought regards the problem as much more
                                complicated than this. While agreeing that the curbing of inflation
                                and the fixing of appropriate exchange rates are essential for
                                convertibility, <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0367"/>this school
                                argues that such measures may not be enough. It lays emphasis on the
                                structural, longer-run, nature of many of the war-induced
                                distortions in production and trade (especially as they have
                                affected the position of Western Europe). Such distortions include
                                the adverse turn in Europe’s terms of trade, the loss of Europe’s
                                overseas investments and earnings therefrom, the relative decline in
                                primary production in underdeveloped countries due to their
                                industrialization programs, the disarrangement of the prewar
                                triangular pattern of world trade, and other such relatively
                                “intractable” factors.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>This school also emphasizes the growing predominance of the United States in
                        the world economy, already apparent long before the last war, which has
                        intensified the effects abroad of short-run economic fluctuations here, and
                        the longer-run disparities in productivity and real income.</p>
                    <p>Because of these structural developments, this school of thought takes a more
                        cautious attitude regarding convertibility. It does not deny that the
                        restoration of convertibility is possible, but it believes that the approach
                        to it should be more gradual and experimental until there is reason to
                        believe that the chances of its success are more assured.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">2. <hi rend="italic">Prospects for Convertibility</hi></p>
                    <p>The general prospects for convertibility today are better than they have been
                        at any time since the war. Production in Western Europe is now well above
                        prewar levels; Europe’s exports have greatly expanded; the internal
                        financial situation in European countries has much improved; the balance of
                        payments of Western Europe with the dollar area has been brought into
                        balance; and monetary reserves abroad are rising.</p>
                    <p>In interpreting these favorable changes, however, account should be taken of
                        several facts. <list>

                            <item>The recent closing of the dollar gap has been accompanied by a
                                favorable change in the terms of trade, due largely to the decline
                                of raw material prices from the high level created by the outbreak
                                of the Korean war. This change, however, may be temporary, since
                                before it occurred the terms of trade had been increasingly adverse
                                to Western Europe because of the large growth of world industrial
                                output since prewar and the relatively small growth of primary
                                production, a relation which, looking to the future, appears to be
                                borne out by the findings of the Paley Report.</item>

                            <item>Owing to direct restriction abroad of dollar imports, the

                                present effective demand.</item>

                                our imports are very sensitive to our level of national <pb n="342"

                                has a multiplied effect in reducing foreign exports to this
                                country.</item>

                            <item>The recent closing of the dollar gap and the increase of monetary
                                reserves abroad (running currently at some two billion dollars a
                                year) has been accompanied by “extraordinary dollar payments” by the
                                United States to other countries of about five billion dollars a
                                year, consisting of disbursements by our military and civilian
                                establishments abroad (and not including our shipments of military

                        </list></p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding these qualifications, it remains true that conditions abroad
                        have substantially improved and that the prospects for achieving
                        convertibility of currency are now better than at any time since the war.
                        These qualifications, however, together with the other considerations
                        mentioned earlier, lead me to favor a gradual approach, rather than a “dash”
                        for convertibility, such as was favored in some government circles in
                        Britain last year. (I might add that the one British economist outside the
                        government, who was consulted last year by the government, disapproved of
                        the “dash” method, even though he adhered to the more optimistic school of
                        thought to which I referred earlier.) By now, the gradual approach seems
                        clearly to be the generally accepted policy in Britain. It is also generally
                        recognized that the prospects for continued advancement toward sterling
                        convertibility, and for its maintenance once established, would be better
                        the larger the number of countries that currently move toward, or establish,
                        convertibility.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">3. <hi rend="italic">Meanings of Convertibility</hi></p>
                    <p>The term convertibility has undergone changes over the years. Under the old
                        gold standard it implied the convertibility of a currency by residents and
                        non-residents into gold, both internally and externally. But no one thinks
                        today any more in terms of convertibility into gold. In current discussions
                        the term has largely come to mean the right of non-residents of a country to
                        convert into any foreign currency their <hi rend="italic">current</hi>
                        earnings in that country’s currency. The term does not necessarily imply the
                        right of non-residents freely to transfer capital out of the country whose
                        currency has become convertible. Nor does it imply the right of residents of
                        that country to export capital freely. On the other hand, if convertibility
                        is to have real meaning, it must be associated with the removal of
                        quantitative trade restrictions, especially those of a discriminatory sort,
                        imposed upon expenditures abroad by residents of the convertible country. It
                        seems to me very doubtful that both of these goals, namely, non-resident
                        convertibility for current transactions and the elimination of
                        discriminatory quantitative trade restrictions imposed on residents, can be
                        achieved simultaneously; a gradualist approach toward <hi rend="italic"
                            >both</hi> goals seems desirable. Since capital <pb n="343"
                            xml:id="pg_343" facs="0369"/>movements by residents and non-residents
                        alike will continue, however, to be controlled for some time to come, the
                        maintenance of an exchange control apparatus will still be necessary even
                        after convertibility and non-discrimination have been restored. In the case
                        of Britain, for example, the <hi rend="italic">outstanding</hi> sterling
                        balances held by foreign countries cannot be made fully convertible for some
                        time to come in view of the great pressures that such convertibility would
                        impose upon the pound. It should be added, however, that the situation as to
                        these balances is now much better than at the end of the war.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">4. <hi rend="italic">Degree of Convertibility
                        Existing</hi></p>
                    <p>Within the sterling area there is already virtually complete
                        interconvertibility of currencies and a virtual absence of quantitative
                        trade restrictions. That is, individuals in the sterling area can freely buy
                        in any other country within the area and freely transfer sterling from one
                        sterling area country to another. Sterling area members are also able to
                        convert their sterling holdings into dollars through the dollar pool
                        arrangements, but the extent to which they do so is limited in actual
                        practice by the quantitative restrictions on imports and payments which the
                        various members, in cooperation with Great Britain, maintain against the
                        United States. Within the European Payments Union, also, there is complete
                        interconvertibility of currencies through the <hi rend="italic"
                            >clearing</hi> facilities provided by the Union and there is also <hi

                            target="#t_EPU1">EPU</gloss> countries maintain discriminatory import
                        restrictions against the United States in the same way as do the members of
                        the sterling area. They have, however, made substantial headway with their
                        trade liberalization program designed to remove discrimination among
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>As the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> witnesses before our Commission
                        emphasized in Paris, one of the chief lessons from the Payments Union
                        experience is that trade liberalization and currency convertibility go hand
                        in hand, and are mutually dependent. One further point about both the
                        sterling area and the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> is that recently
                        their exports have become more competitive with ours in third markets, and
                        that some steps have been taken in both areas towards lessening restrictions
                        on dollar goods. These recent developments should not be exaggerated, but so
                        far as they go, they have a favorable bearing on the feasibility of more
                        general convertibility.</p>

                    <p>There are various possible ways in which convertibility (and

                        <item>One possible method would be through the so-called “commodity
                            convertibility” with which Britain is currently experimenting. That is,
                            non-residents might be permitted increasingly to use their sterling
                            holdings to buy dollar commodities, e.g., non-ferrous metals, on British
                            commodity markets. Since the list of commodities could be gradually
                            enlarged, this would be a way of gradually approaching the goal of full
                            currency convertibility. The advantage of this method is that it permits
                            the country in question to keep a firm hand upon the process of
                            transition toward fuller convertibility and avoids a large and sudden
                            rush by other countries into dollars via sterling, such as occurred in
                            1947 and would always be a danger so long as a substantial dollar gap
                            exists anywhere in the world.</item>

                        <item>Another method of gradually approaching convertibility would be for
                            the British to grant the convertibility privilege into dollars to a
                            growing list of countries instead of introducing it to all countries

                        <item>Another method, which seems to have a considerable amount of support
                            on the continent at the present time, would be gradually to remove
                            quantitative import restrictions against the United States and to
                            introduce convertibility only at a later stage.</item>
                        <label>(d)</label>
                        <item>Finally, there could be a gradual approach to convertibility within
                            the framework of the European Payments Union itself rather than via a
                            few key currencies such as sterling. Serious doubts, however, exist as
                            to the feasibility of this approach without destroying the Payments
                            Union. The Managing Board of the Union, after having studied the
                            technical problems involved for over a year, have recently been
                            requested by the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> Council to study
                            the matter further and report next March. My own view is that it would
                            be desirable to preserve <gloss target="#t_EPU1">EPU</gloss> if that can
                            be done without preventing the advance toward convertibility of sterling
                            and other European currencies into dollars, but that since, as the
                                <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> representatives have always
                            stated, <gloss target="#t_EPU1">EPU</gloss> is not an end in itself but
                            only a step toward more general convertibility, the question of its
                            preservation should not be allowed to stand in the way of progress
                            toward more general, world-wide convertibility of the major currencies,
                            particularly sterling.</item>

                    <p rend="flushleft">6. <hi rend="italic">Floating Exchange Rates</hi></p>
                    <p>If sterling and certain other Western European countries become convertible
                        the British and the other countries concerned may want to let their rates
                        “float,” for a while at least, rather than to hold them fixed as they are
                        today. In fact, the British Government has stated that it will not undertake
                        any substantial steps toward fuller convertibility except on a basis of
                        floating rates. A floating rate would tend to relieve some of the pressures
                        on reserves that might be associated with the introduction of
                        convertibility. For, if the rate tended to decline, exports would tend to be
                        stimulated and imports to be retarded. It is believed also that, if the rate
                        declined, adverse speculative pressures against the currencies concerned
                        would tend to be discouraged, since speculators would fear the <pb n="345"
                            xml:id="pg_345" facs="0371"/>losses that would result if the floating
                        exchange rate moved up again, or was pushed up by official support. There is
                        a risk, however, that a floating rate might actually accentuate rather than
                        improve the convertible countries’ positions by increasing the cost of
                        imports, causing inflationary pressures at home, and creating fears that the
                        rate might continue to drop rather than rise.</p>
                    <p>As the British have said, they want a “floating” rate and not a “sinking”
                        rate. It is therefore necessary to form a judgment whether the internal
                        economy is strong enough to provide reasonable assurance that inflationary
                        and speculative pressures will not get out of hand. Thus the use of a
                        “floating” rate, though technically desirable in that it provides, as
                        Chancellor Butler said, two ways of meeting an external deficit (letting
                        reserves go or letting the currency depreciate) again argues for a gradual
                        and controlled approach toward sterling convertibility.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">7. <hi rend="italic">What Might the United States
                        Do?</hi></p>
                    <p>A great psychological lift to Western Europe would result if the United
                        States gave its verbal blessing and active encouragement to a move toward
                        convertibility by Britain and some other European countries. On the other
                        hand, it is important that we do not put a date on convertibility, as we did
                        in the case of the pound sterling in 1947. The time schedule for, as well as
                        the method of, restoring convertibility is something that should be decided
                        upon by foreign countries themselves and not by us. Finally, the United
                        States might, at the appropriate time, provide the additional reserves to
                        foreign countries that might be needed to support convertibility of foreign
                        currencies.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">8. <hi rend="italic">The Question of Monetary Reserves and
                            Stabilization Credits</hi></p>
                    <p>Despite the recent increase in the monetary reserves of foreign countries,
                        these reserves, and especially those of Great Britain, are much lower,
                        relative to the volume of world trade, than they were before the war. Great
                        Britain has already made it clear that convertibility could not be safely
                        undertaken unless the volume of its reserves is enlarged.</p>
                    <p>There is a growing insistence that, in order to support a move to
                        convertibility abroad, the gold and dollar resources of the International
                        Monetary Fund, now about 3.3 billion dollars, should be put to much more
                        active use than they have in the past. It is believed, for example, that the
                        Fund could extend a stand-by credit of approximately 2 billion dollars to
                        Great Britain, plus the outer sterling area, to support a move to
                        convertibility. The Fund might also be able to grant small stand-by credits
                        to other countries contemplating convertibility. Attention should be
                        directed to all possible <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0372"/>methods by
                        which the Fund’s resources could be put to more active use for this
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p>The present resources of the Fund, however, would probably be inadequate to
                        satisfy the reserve needs of Great Britain and other countries for a
                        convertibility undertaking. It seems probable, therefore, that <hi
                            rend="italic">additional</hi> reserve funds might have to be provided if
                        this goal is to be achieved. One possibility would be to enlarge the
                        resources of the Fund itself by an increased contribution from the United
                        States. Another alternative, which would not involve any public debt
                        transaction, would be the granting of stabilization credits to foreign
                        central banks by the Federal Reserve System. Such credits have been granted
                        in the past and might usefully be granted in the future.</p>
                    <p>Whichever method of supplementing reserves might be decided upon, the basic
                        purpose of stand-by credits and stabilization credits is to strengthen
                        confidence in the currencies becoming convertible and therefore to
                        discourage speculative pressures that might arise and endanger the continued
                        maintenance of convertibility. Standby credits and stabilization credits
                        should not be regarded as methods of financing continuing dollar deficits of
                        foreign countries. In fact, if such deficits existed, on any substantial
                        scale, convertibility would in any case not be feasible.</p>
                    <p>In concluding this statement, I will try to bring together my own ideas. To
                        achieve and maintain full currency convertibility a country should be in a
                        strong economic position, internally and externally. It should have removed
                        direct internal controls and have proved its ability to control its money
                        supply and its budget. Externally, it should have overcome its balance of
                        payments deficit or be far along toward that goal, in order to be reasonably
                        sure that convertibility will assist and not endanger progress toward that
                        objective.</p>
                    <p>I take the more serious view of the world’s dollar problem, namely, that it
                        contains “intractable” elements. The present apparent balance (apart from
                        our military exports) is illusory, in that there are still large
                        “extraordinary” dollar expenditures, the removal of which would reveal a
                        dollar gap of about $3 billion (as against a postwar average of $4 billion)
                        which could easily increase if there were a recession here or if the terms
                        of trade of Western Europe should take an unfavorable turn.</p>
                    <p>In these circumstances, I think that it would be unwise for us to press the
                        British, or any other country, toward currency convertibility, and that the
                        decision, timing and responsibility should rest entirely on the country
                        concerned. Nevertheless, there has been enough progress, internally and
                        externally, to warrant Britain, and probably some other countries, in taking
                        gradual steps toward currency <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0373"
                        />convertibility. The most important single step, I believe, is that on
                        which the British seem already embarked—that of gradually removing trade
                        restrictions and reopening commodity markets for dollar goods, and
                        permitting the holders of sterling balances owned by third countries to
                        purchase dollar goods. This is a way of gradually expanding the area of
                        currency convertibility through “commodity” convertibility, which seems to
                        me a much more controllable process than the <hi rend="italic">general</hi>
                        convertibility that Britain attempted in 1947.</p>
                    <p>Though I do not favor letting the rate go free to “find its own level,” which
                        presents the danger of a vicious circle of inflation, I am sympathetic
                        toward the British desire to have a “floating rate,” fluctuating around some
                        norm, and I feel certain that the British would not attempt anything like
                        full convertibility on any other basis. Other points on which I think they
                        would insist, and I think rightly, are controlling capital movements (at
                        least outside the sterling area) and taking effective precautions against
                        runs on the previously accumulated sterling balances, even though the
                        situation as to these balances is now much better than at the end of the
                        war.</p>
                    <p>One further important question, which however we may feel goes beyond our
                        province, is the effect of sterling (and other European currency)
                        convertibility upon the European Payments Union. The British have apparently
                        withdrawn from their position of a year ago, when they were proposing an
                        escape clause permitting withdrawal from <gloss target="#t_EPU1">EPU</gloss>
                        on three months’ notice if they decided to make sterling convertible; and as
                        the matter now stands after a year of study by the <gloss target="#t_EPU1"
                            >EPU</gloss> Managing Board, the Board is requested to report again next
                        March on the question of compatibility of currency (particularly sterling)
                        convertibility and the continued functioning of <gloss target="#t_EPU1"
                            >EPU</gloss>. My view is that <gloss target="#t_EPU1">EPU</gloss> has
                        always been regarded (by its own testimony) as a temporary mechanism with
                        limited objectives—an intra-European multilateral system of trade and
                        payment. But it has achieved an impressive measure of success—above all, it
                        has shown that freeing trade and freeing payment go hand in hand—and we
                        should not sponsor any measures which might wreck it before there is
                        something better to put in its place. This is a problem for the British and
                        the other <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> countries to thrash out
                        among themselves.</p>
                    <p>Last and most important, is the question of adequacy of reserves. It must
                        always be borne in mind that sterling is a <hi rend="italic">key</hi>
                        currency, i.e., a currency used to finance the trade of <hi rend="italic"
                            >third</hi> countries. Even now sterling finances about half of the
                        total trade of the world, and if made convertible it would be exposed to
                        trade, financial and speculative pressures to a far greater extent than
                        other European currencies This is indeed why, in proper circumstances, we
                        want <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0374"/>sterling to become
                        convertible, in the interests of freer trade and payment in a world-wide
                        multilateral system. But it follows that confidence in sterling must be
                        fully restored, which means, among other things, that Britain’s reserves
                        must be greatly strengthened. I have mentioned earlier the International
                        Monetary Fund and some credit arrangement between the Bank of England and
                        the Federal Reserve System as the most likely possibilities.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, it is of course clear that currency convertibility must be
                        examined in the light of the policies pursued by other countries,
                        particularly the United States. Thus all the other aspects of our current
                        study—foreign investment, customs, tariff, agricultural policy, etc., have a
                        bearing. As the British have put it, sterling convertibility depends in part
                        on our pursuing “good creditor policies.” We might have, as I do myself, a
                        more serious view than other countries might have of the difficulties
                        involved in pursuing such a course. But I think we should see that the view
                        that we do take on all these questions will have an important bearing on the
                        speed, the methods, and the timetable involved in achieving
                            convertibility.<note n="2" xml:id="d108fn2">For the Randall Commission’s

                    <p>This meeting was arranged at Mr. Smith’s request to enable him to apprise the
                        Department informally of the Treasury Department’s tentative conclusions
                        concerning additional tax measures affecting foreign earned income. He asked
                        that these conclusions be <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0375"/>kept
                        strictly confidential for the time being as the Treasury has not yet taken
                        them up with the House Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Smith indicated that he
                        was under instructions to seek the views of the Departments most directly
                        concerned (Commerce, State, and <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>), and
                        the Randall Commission.</p>
                    <p>1. Mr. Smith said the Treasury was prepared to recommend that the present
                        benefits available for so-called Western Hemisphere Trade Corporations<note
                            n="1" xml:id="d109fn1">Reference is to the provisions incorporated into
                            the Internal Revenue Code in 1942 extending tax advantages to foreign
                            investment by U.S. firms in the Western Hemisphere. To qualify as a
                            Western Hemisphere Trade Corporation, a domestic firm had to do all of
                            its business, aside from incidentals, in the Western Hemisphere, derive
                            more than 95 percent of its gross income from sources outside the United
                            States, and obtain more than 90 percent of its gross income from the
                            actual conduct of trade or business.</note> be applicable to income
                        received from any foreign source, and that the requirements for taxpayers
                        qualifying for such benefits be liberalized. At the present time a special
                        tax rate of 38% (in contrast to the 52% regular rate) is available to
                        domestic corporations receiving 95% of their income from sources within the
                        Western Hemisphere (but outside the U.S.) and 90% of their income from the
                        active conduct of a trade or business. The Treasury’s thought is to maintain
                        this 14 point spread (52–38) for all foreign earned income. In addition,
                        changes would be recommended in the source percentages for qualification,
                        and in the requirement for establishing a separate domestic corporation in
                        order to take advantage of the lower rate. In discussing this proposal, Mr
                        Smith pointed out that it would pretty much amount to a full waiver of taxes
                        on foreign income since the local tax rate in most countries (allowable as a
                        credit against U.S. taxes) is at least as high as 38%.</p>
                    <p>2. The Treasury also proposes to eliminate the so-called “overall” limitation
                        in computing the credit for foreign taxes paid. Under this limitation all
                        foreign income is treated as a single unit and the tax credit is limited to
                        the amount of the U.S. income tax on the net income from operations in all
                        foreign countries. Thus, losses in one country must first be set off against
                        income from others in calculating the limitation on the amount of the
                        credit.</p>
                    <p>3. The Treasury proposes to retain the so-called “per-country” limitation,
                        whereby foreign income received from each country must be treated as a
                        separate unit and the credit is limited to the U.S. tax attributable to
                        income from each country. This limitation prevents the taxpayer from
                        crediting the full amount of taxes paid in a country having higher tax rates
                        than the U.S. through an offset with respect to operations in a country with
                        a lower tax rate than the U.S.</p>
                    <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0376"/>
                    <p>4. The Treasury has had some second thoughts concerning the proposal for
                        postponing the tax on foreign branch income until it is transferred to the
                        U.S. parent—a provision now applicable to income from foreign subsidiary
                        operations. The Treasury feels that branch operations already receive
                        substantial benefits under the tax laws, such as the consolidation of losses
                        with the U.S. parent and the depletion allowances presently available to
                        petroleum and mining enterprises. Since it is precisely this type of
                        enterprise that usually uses the branch form of organization the Treasury
                        now feels that further tax benefits are unwarranted. In short, it questions
                        the desirability and necessity of giving to both branches and subsidiaries
                        the benefits applicable to each. (The next step might be to permit
                        subsidiaries to “bring home” losses as branches can now do through
                        consolidated returns with the parent.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sauer suggested a possible alternative to the unrestricted postponement
                        of the tax on foreign branch income until received by the U.S. parent:
                        namely, the possibility of permitting such postponement only if the foreign
                        branch agreed not to consolidate its losses with the U.S. parent <hi
                            rend="italic">and</hi> not to take advantage of any depletion allowances
                        otherwise available. Thus, branch income could not claim the cumulative
                        effect of all benefits but could select those most favorable to its
                        particular circumstances. Mr. Smith agreed that this approach had some
                        merit, but required further study and refinement.</p>
                    <p>There was some discussion of the relative merits of branch and subsidiary
                        forms of organization from the policy point of view. It was suggested that
                        less capitalization is generally required to establish a foreign branch,
                        which has been an important factor in conducting branch banking abroad, for
                        example. Moreover, a foreign branch may have readier access to the U.S.
                        capital market through the established standing of its parent in the U.S. On
                        the other hand, a foreign subsidiary may be more effective in mobilizing
                        local share participation and in developing local securities markets. It was
                        also suggested that perhaps we ought not weight the scales unduly in favor
                        of the branch type of organization and thereby discourage American companies
                        from establishing domestic corporations under local laws abroad and thus
                        becoming identified as domestic organizations within the foreign country. In
                        reply to Mr. Smith’s question Mr. Waugh indicated that he thought American
                        companies would be well advised to associate themselves with local interests
                        and to organize with some local participation.</p>
                    <p>5. Mr. Smith said that the Treasury was thinking of liberalizing the
                        definition of foreign taxes that qualify as a credit against the U.S. tax.
                        Foreign income taxes, and foreign taxes in lieu of an income tax, may now be
                        credited. (All foreign taxes may generally <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351"
                            facs="0377"/>be deducted from gross income in computing taxable income.)
                        The Treasury would propose allowing a credit for foreign income taxes <hi
                            rend="italic">or</hi> for any other one tax which constituted the
                        principal tax on business operations. If there were both an income tax and,
                        for example, a turnover tax, the company could elect which to take as a tax
                        credit and which to deduct as an expense from gross income.</p>
                    <p>6. We asked Mr. Smith how the Treasury felt about the charge frequently made
                        that the existing tax credit procedure limited the flexibility of foreign
                        countries in offering effective tax concessions to new industries
                        contributing to their economic development. He said the Treasury had given
                        considerable thought to this, but that in view of the special treatment of
                        foreign subsidiary income (postponement of tax until dividends repatriated),
                        local tax concessions could be very meaningful, and thus the Treasury
                        thought nothing additional was necessary on this point—particularly in view
                        of proposals in paragraphs 1, 2 and 5 above.</p>
                    <p>7. Mr. Smith then brought up the general subject of the definition of
                        foreign-earned income, in which the Treasury’s views seemed to be much more
                        uncertain. He pointed out that under present practices the Western
                        Hemisphere Trade Corporation provisions have been very beneficial to
                        American export organizations. Since income is considered as accruing where
                        title passes, such organizations need only arrange for the title on exports
                        to pass in the foreign country for the income thereon to be considered as
                        foreign. Mr. Smith felt that the requirements could be so drafted as to
                        eliminate this if desirable, and asked what the Department’s views were on
                        this point. We stated that we would, of course, want to explore this with
                        other interested offices in the Department but admitted that our starting
                        point in considering this problem was to encourage local productive
                        operating enterprises abroad rather than U.S. exports as such. We agreed to
                        give this problem some thought and to give Mr. Smith any views we might
                        develop.</p>
                    <p>8. The meeting concluded with Mr. Waugh’s expressing our appreciation to Mr.
                        Smith for giving us the Treasury’s tentative conclusions in this important
                        field, and for consulting us concerning them. He noted that the Treasury’s
                        views went a long way toward meeting the problem, and stressed again his
                        feeling that the major emphasis in the matter of encouraging foreign
                        investment ought to be on what other countries should do to attract
                        investment rather than on what we should do to push it out—a proposition to
                        which Mr. Smith expressed thorough agreement. Mr. Smith said the Treasury is
                        anxious to consult the House Ways and Means Committee in the very near
                        future, and thus would appreciate receiving our views as soon as
                        possible.</p>

                        Walter Sauer’s office at the Treasury on the proposals being developed for

                        Gordon and Julius Greisman.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out that in discussing the Treasury’s proposals among ourselves
                        certain questions had come up which we wanted to explore further with the
                        Treasury people. Mr. Sauer said they were particularly glad to do so as they
                        were just in the process of preparing a memorandum setting forth the
                        proposals more specifically and analyzing some of their implications and
                        effects. He admitted that events were moving quickly, and while he could not
                        be certain how fluid the thinking was in upper levels at the Treasury he was
                        confident that any views we might have would be given consideration. He
                        seemed uncertain as to whether the specific foreign tax proposals would be
                        included in the budget message stated by the President to be forthcoming on
                        January 21.<note n="†" xml:id="d110fn-sym11">This has since been confirmed.
                            [Footnote in the source text.]</note></p>
                    <p>We talked first about the proposal that the Western Hemisphere provisions be
                        left in their present form, and that a similar 14 point preferential rate of
                        taxation be given to the income from subsidiaries actively engaged in a
                        trade or business anywhere abroad, and from branches which elect to be
                        treated as subsidiaries for tax purposes (which would thereby lose their
                        rights to any depletion allowances and to consolidating their income with
                        that of the parent for tax purposes.) We pointed out that this appeared to
                        discriminate in favor of investment in the Western Hemisphere, since a
                        domestic corporation qualifying thereunder could get both the preferential
                        rate and depletion allowances. Mr. Sauer admitted that this was the effect,
                        and that the Treasury had no answer for it. He did point out that the
                        requirements would be much less rigid for firms to <pb n="353"

                        would be available to firms operating in the Western Hemisphere as well as
                        elsewhere (no special domestic subsidiary necessary in order to qualify, for
                        example).</p>
                    <p>It is apparent that the Treasury feels that any proposal which does away with
                        the Western Hemisphere device, or so alters it as to exclude exporting
                        firms, would be politically unfeasible because of the opposition it would
                        encounter from the exporting interests. Therefore, it will propose
                        preferential treatment for this new category of enterprises. Such treatment
                        would be available only to subsidiaries or branches actively engaged in the
                        conduct of a trade or business within a foreign country. The qualifications
                        would presumably be so drawn as to include firms such as Sears Roebuck which
                        undertake their own retail distribution and develop local sources of supply,
                        and exclude firms which export goods on consignment or who operate only
                        through sales offices or agencies abroad.</p>
                    <p>It became clear in the discussion that the Treasury’s test will be the nature
                        and extent of the service or production performed abroad by the American
                        firm. The mere holding of shares in a foreign firm would not be sufficient
                        to qualify for the preferential tax rate, unless the holding corporation
                        actively participates in the management or operation of the foreign firm.
                        There seemed to be some difference of opinion in the Treasury as to whether
                        a firm would have to draw a line between income derived from the active
                        conduct of a trade or business and investment income, for example, or
                        whether all income would receive preferential treatment if a substantial
                        part thereof was derived from the active conduct of trade or business. Since
                        we are endeavoring to encourage investment as such, we suggested strongly
                        that the Treasury consider extending the preferential rate to income arising
                        from such investment (i.e. net, new corporate investment) regardless of
                        whether the investment is accompanied by the active participation of the
                        American investor. The provision of capital per se is often as vital to
                        economic development as technical and/or managerial skills. Although
                        investments by individuals would not qualify, the individual would merely
                        have to incorporate in order to qualify. Mr. Sauer recognized the validity
                        of our point and agreed to flag it for the attention of Mr. Smith.</p>
                    <p>We made it clear that we were in agreement with the Treasury’s desire to
                        encourage active business operations abroad, i.e. investment, rather than
                        American exports as such. We did point out that additional channels of
                        distribution are sometimes very important in terms of a country’s economic
                        development, but agreed that a line had to be drawn somewhere if the
                        principal emphasis was to be on the encouragement of active business
                        operations abroad. I’m <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0380"/>sure the
                        Treasury people understood that we were in agreement with their general
                        approach to the problem, except for the suggested inclusion of investment
                        income and some uneasiness about the difference in treatment between
                        investment in Latin America and in the rest of the world.<note n="‡"
                            xml:id="d110fn-sym5">Mr. Thompson later suggested that the Treasury may
                            well want Congress to deal with this situation, without itself taking
                            the initiative of altering the Western Hemisphere benefits so as to
                            exclude export firms. [Footnote in the source text.]</note></p>
                    <p>We then turned to the question of extending the definition of foreign taxes
                        that would qualify as a tax credit. The Treasury is still proposing to
                        permit a credit for foreign income taxes or any other single tax that
                        constitutes the principal tax on business income. We did not take exception
                        to the Treasury’s thinking on this point, except for suggesting further
                        flexibility through tax treaties (see below). It was noted that if the
                        principal tax was, for example, an excise tax or a turnover tax the total
                        collected might be unrelated to the firm’s taxable income and if credited
                        against the U.S. tax would in many cases result in complete exemption from
                        the U.S. tax.</p>
                    <p>We then raised the question of still further tax incentives through tax
                        treaties. Mr. Sauer agreed personally that there are two additional areas
                        which should be explored in extending the tax treaty program: (1) additional
                        flexibility in defining the particular foreign taxes that might qualify as a
                        tax credit, and (2) accommodation to situations in which the foreign
                        government offers local tax concessions to new investment, so as to enable
                        American firms to receive the advantage of such concessions. There was
                        little discussion of this notion, but Mr. Sauer indicated that a nudge from
                        the Department in this direction would be quite appropriate. In urging the
                        Treasury to consider doing something along this line we pointed out that,
                        even though legislation might not be required, it would be well for
                        something to be said about it in the forthcoming tax message as such a
                        statement of intent, for example, would be highly useful at the Caracas
                        conference or in some other international forum where we might be pressed on
                        this matter.</p>
                    <p>We expressed our appreciation for the opportunity of exploring these matters
                        with Mr. Sauer and his associates, and they seemed to feel quite genuinely
                        that they too had benefitted from the discussion. Mr. Sauer undertook to
                        pass our questions and suggestions along to Mr. Smith, and to keep us
                        informed of any further developments.</p>

                        activities of the Export-Import Bank and the International Bank, I have had
                        a number of conferences concerning the most effective way of using the
                        facilities of the Export-Import Bank. On the basis of these conversations we
                        have revised the memorandum of suggested action for consideration of the
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>, and I enclose herewith a revised
                        draft of it.</p>
                    <p>I think on this basis of using guaranties, along with a fair equity
                        participation by the borrower, that the Bank can go a good deal further than
                        the first memorandum<note n="1" xml:id="d112fn1">Reference is to the
                            memorandum dated Jan. 7, 1954, printed as attachment 1 to Secretary

                        said in part as follows: “The Fund’s resources provide a second line of

                        use of reserves to supplement current export earnings. These reserves may be
                        a country’s own reserves, or the reserves held in common by members in the

                        which the Fund was established. One of the Fund’s most important functions
                        is to assist its members to mitigate the impact of a sharp decline in their
                        foreign exchange upon their ability to maintain a needed volume of imports
                        and a high level of employment.”<note n="*" xml:id="d114fn-sym9">In this
                            connection see also the attached excerpt from the Fund’s report to
                                <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> on the adequacy of

                    <p>In the light of the foregoing statements, the first proposal of the experts
                        would appear superfluous. The Fund declaration envisaged in the first
                        proposal—to the effect that the Fund intends to use its resources boldly
                        during a slump—is one which the above statements seem to cover
                        explicitly.</p>
                    <p>2. It may be argued by some countries that the second proposal of the
                        experts—concerning a Fund declaration of intent to replenish its resources
                        when these reach certain minimum levels—follows logically from the general
                        position of the Fund indicated above and should be accepted by the Fund on
                        these grounds. It might be urged that since the statements cited above
                        pledge help to members with balance-of-payments difficulties during a
                        recession abroad, and since there is no evidence that the pledge means the
                        help is to be limited to the use of the Fund’s existing resources, the Fund
                        is in fact committed to seek new resources if they should stand at, or fall
                        to, levels at which little or no help is possible when members find
                        themselves in difficult straits.</p>
                    <p>Such a conclusion should be opposed as unwarranted. The Fund statements cited
                        above are expressions of general policy only. It would be quite unreasonable
                        to interpret them to mean that the Fund would extend help to members during
                        any recession and in any amounts, whatever the surrounding circumstances and
                        amounts involved.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, it is clear that any increase in the Fund’s resources to be used
                        for the purpose of combatting a possible recession would have to come
                        largely from the U.S., and all the countries represented in the <gloss
                            target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> would be fully aware that this is the
                        case. Inasmuch as it is uncertain whether the U.S. Government would be
                        willing to supply additional resources to the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                            >IMF</gloss> for such a purpose, we should be very careful to avoid any
                        statement or action that might be taken to imply a commitment to do so. If
                        we were to support, first in the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                        Executive Board and secondly in the <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                            >ECOSOC</gloss>, any declaration of intent by the <gloss
                            target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> to seek an increase in its resources when
                        this becomes necessary, we might be held to be implying that when the time
                        came we could be expected to implement the suggestion—a misleading
                        implication.</p>
                    <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0389"/>
                    <p>3. The third of the experts’ proposals looks to a negotiation by the Fund
                        with its major members to see how far increases in the Fund’s resources can
                        be pledged in advance. During the debate on <hi rend="italic">Measures for
                            International Economic Stability</hi> at the 14th Session of <gloss
                            target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>, the U.S. representative stated that
                        the U.S. would be prepared to give “proper consideration” to the matter of
                        an increase in the resources of the Fund at such time as this becomes
                        necessary. The experts’ third proposal might be met by recalling this
                        statement. In this connection, the U.S. representative should note that a
                        U.S. Government commitment to contribute to a future increase in resources
                        is legally impossible. The Bretton Woods Agreements Act specifically enjoins
                        the Executive Branch from committing the U.S. to raise its quota in the
                        Fund, or to lend the Fund money, except after action by Congress. Nor can
                        one Congress assure action by its successors. An affirmative vote on any
                        proposal designed to obtain prior assurances of increased dollar resources
                        for the Fund at some future time is therefore out of the question.</p>
                    <p>The statement that the Executive Branch cannot commit the United States
                        Government to a further contribution to the Fund’s resources may precipitate
                        a proposal aimed at eliciting a pledge by member governments that, should a
                        contribution in fact be requested at some future time, the responsible
                        national authorities (Executive Branch) would recommend appropriate action
                        to this end, in accordance with their established constitutional
                        procedures.</p>
                    <p>If developments take this course, the U.S. representative might state that
                        future circumstances cannot be foreseen. There is always the possibility
                        that a Fund request to the U.S. in the future for additional resources might
                        be regarded by the Executive Branch as unnecessary or unjustified. In such a
                        situation, the Executive Branch would obviously not wish to be pledged to

                        Meeting. The Acting Chairman indicated that the two principal financial
                        aspects of the proposed United States position were the role of the
                        International Monetary Fund and the proposal for a European Fund, and asked
                        for comments on these matters.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Southard commented on relationships between the International Monetary

                            target="#t_OEEC1">O.E.E.C.</gloss> and reviewed some of the problems
                        that may be anticipated in the Fund at the time positive steps toward
                        convertibility <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0391"/>are taken. He felt
                        that as a permanent organization with an adequate staff, the Fund is in a
                        position to respond to additional needs for coordination with respect to the
                            <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. With respect to <gloss
                            target="#t_OEEC1">O.E.E.C.</gloss> he pointed out that the Fund has a
                        representative in Paris for liaison with <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                            >O.E.E.C.</gloss> and that if more effective relationships are desired,
                        this could be worked out. Among the anticipated problems, he mentioned the
                        apparent restiveness on the part of the United Kingdom with the present
                        system of weighted voting in the Fund and the desire of the United Kingdom
                        to find a way of dealing with the extreme creditor problem. He felt that
                        paragraph 6 of the paper presented an adequate United States position on the
                        extreme creditor question and that the United States should not favor any
                        arrangement which would result in automatic sanctions against itself.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hunter reviewed the salient points of discussions in Europe on the
                        question of the proposed European Fund. He pointed out that the European
                        Payments Union has been useful and that the Europeans did not wish to
                        abandon it without adequate replacement, since even after some currencies
                        are made convertible, there will probably be some countries which will have
                        inconvertible currencies for some time and which may need assistance. It was
                        felt that a European Fund could help the weak countries through loans out of
                        the $271 million of <gloss target="#t_EPU1">EPU</gloss> assets which will be
                        available upon dissolution of <gloss target="#t_EPU1">EPU</gloss>. Loans to
                        such countries would probably be non-automatic. He recalled that the United
                        States has the right of veto over the ultimate disposition of the assets of
                            <gloss target="#t_EPU1">EPU</gloss> upon its liquidation, and he
                        therefore expected the Europeans to present a plan for United States review
                        and approval.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Shearer noted that there was general agreement that credits from a
                        European Fund should be on an <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> basis, but that
                        there was a wide range of views as to which countries would be eligible for
                        aid and under what conditions the <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> loans would
                        be appropriate.</p>
                    <p>There was further discussion of the European Fund proposal and general
                        agreement that such a fund would be managed by the Council of the <gloss
                            target="#t_OEEC1">O.E.E.C.</gloss> At the conclusion of the discussion,
                        Mr. Burgess commented that in view of the United States veto over the
                        disposition of <gloss target="#t_EPU1">EPU</gloss> assets, it seemed clear
                        that the United States would be asked to approve some plan for a European
                        Fund. Therefore, he felt that the United States Government should be
                        prepared to comment on the proposal. He suggested that additional work on
                        the idea of the European Fund should be undertaken by the <gloss
                            target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Staff Committee and that the revised
                        position paper should be submitted to the Council at a later date. The
                        Council agreed to this procedure. (The Staff Committee subsequently
                        presented <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Document <pb n="366"

                        Convertibility</hi></p>
                    <p>1. U.S. recognizes the importance of <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> as
                        an effective forum for coordinating work on international trade and payments
                        of European member countries and their internal economic policies,
                        particularly during the impending transition to currency convertibility and
                        liberalization of imports on a global basis. It appreciates the desirability
                        of preserving and strengthening the real gains which trade liberalization
                        has brought for the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> countries and
                        attaches importance in this connection to the willingness which this
                        homogeneous group of countries have previously demonstrated in this forum to
                        abide by quite rigid trade rules and to submit internal policies to
                        continuous and intensive multilateral review.</p>
                    <p>2. Closer liaison should be maintained with the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                            >IMF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, including
                        greater participation as appropriate of <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                        and <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> representatives in the work of the
                            <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> in the trade and payments field.
                        Approaches to the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> for drawings or
                        stand-by arrangements should be made by member countries and not by <gloss
                            target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> as such.</p>
                    <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> should undertake a firm
                        commitment to establish global trade liberalization programs for member
                        countries to be approved at its next Ministerial Meeting this coming fall.
                        These programs should involve (a) immediate steps for moving ahead toward
                        full intra-European and dollar liberalization as rapidly as balance of
                        payments positions permit and (b) provisions for the control of
                        deliberalization if subsequent developments require.</p>
                    <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0393"/>
                    <p>These programs should not be spelled out in detail in this meeting. However,
                        the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> rules should provide, subject to
                        appropriate escape clauses, a general policy of non-discrimination as
                        between currency areas in new measures of liberalization or deliberalization
                        following a general move toward convertibility. The <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                            >OEEC</gloss> rules should also seek progressive elimination of existing
                        discrimination by increasing liberalization toward the dollar area without
                        impairment of existing intra-European liberalization. These rules could well
                        call for the elimination of discrimination by convertible countries within a
                        reasonable period of time, and in the case of the inconvertible countries,
                        could involve a reduction in trade barriers and a reduction in
                        discrimination looking toward the introduction of full convertibility as
                        rapidly as feasible. In formulating and operating the escape clauses
                        referred to above, full consideration would be given to the effect of the
                        new rules on the balance of payments of <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"

                        as they are reached in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. The
                        programs should not preclude the stronger countries from moving more rapidly
                        toward liberalization and non-discrimination nor should they prejudice
                        arrangements which may be made in connection with drawings and stand-by
                        arrangements from the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>4. A European Fund should be set up under <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"

                        liquidation in order to facilitate adequate temporary financing for
                        liberalization programs of member countries. The U.S. would welcome
                        contributions by the stronger European countries of additional financial and
                        credit facilities on a multilateral basis to assist the weaker countries to
                        maintain liberalized trading arrangements.</p>
                    <p>5. The work of the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and that of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                            >OEEC</gloss> in this field will necessarily be closely coordinated.
                        This must be accomplished primarily through effective coordination of the
                        positions taken in each forum by the individual countries concerned, nearly
                        all of whom do participate in all three organizations. In this field the
                        U.S. will, of course, continue to associate itself closely with the <gloss
                            target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>, as it has in the past, and to provide
                        full support and cooperation on problems of common interest. The U.S.
                        preliminary inclination, as expressed in instructions for the Alternates
                        Meeting, was not to favor additional international organizations but rather
                        improve working arrangements and coordination among international <pb
                            n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0394"/>organizations now dealing with
                        these relations. Coordination might be further facilitated by improving and
                        strengthening the administrative machinery of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss>, and improvement of the procedure for consultation between
                        the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss>. (Additional statement illustrating improved procedures in
                        preparation.)</p>
                    <p>6. The suggestion that additional provisions be made for the treatment of
                        countries in extreme creditor positions is one of great concern to the U.S.
                        We believe that this topic is adequately covered by existing provisions in
                        the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund.</p>
                    <p>7. While the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> should not undertake to
                        sponsor tariff negotiations, the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> may
                        appropriately discuss tariff problems incidental to other <gloss
                            target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> activities, and we welcome such tariff
                        reductions by individual countries as may result from such discussions. The
                        function of sponsoring tariff negotiations should be left to the <gloss
                            target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. In any case the U.S. would not wish to
                        see <hi rend="italic">any</hi> departure from the global or
                        most-favored-nation principle with respect to tariffs by introducing a
                        preferential system which does not now exist.</p>
                    <p>8. Furthermore, the U.S. believes that most determined efforts should be made
                        by the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> to avoid bilateral arrangements
                        either within the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> or with non-member
                        countries. It is believed that bilateralism constitutes a most serious
                        threat of breaking down progress which has been made in a freer system of
                        trade and payments both globally and within the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                            >OEEC</gloss> area.</p>
                    <p>9. The special problems of continued implementation of the Code by countries
                        unable to return immediately to convertibility will need further examination
                        by the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>: but it should be pointed out
                        that steady and persistent debtor positions will need to be dealt with
                        through proper policies in debtor countries (including exchange rate
                        adjustment).</p>

                    <p>In accordance with these legislative requirements and with the Loan-Grant
                        Policy which was discussed in the National Advisory Council on June 1, 1954,
                        and was agreed by the Cabinet on June 4, 1954, the Foreign Operations
                        Administration submits for National Advisory consideration the following
                        program for fiscal year 1955:</p>
                    <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0397"/>
                    <p>Loans under the authority of the Mutual Security Act of 1954 will be made on
                        terms not more lenient to the borrowing government than those described
                        below. Loans will provide for the repayment within fifty years. Interest
                        will begin to accrue not later than the beginning of the fourth year.
                        Payment in full of accrued interest will begin not later than the middle of
                        the fourth year. Repayments of principal will begin not later than the
                        beginning of the fifth year. The applicable rate of interest will be not
                        less than 3% if interest and amortization payments to the U.S. Government
                        are to be in dollars and not less than 4% if the payments are to be in the
                        currency of the borrowing government. Payments of interest and repayments of
                        principal will be made semiannually. If the combined interest and
                        amortization payments are to be made in ascending amounts the increase will
                        be steady throughout the entire period of the payments. (The maximum rate of
                        progression would then be such as to require an initial combined payment of
                        $15,000, a semiannual increase of $136.92, and a final payment of $27,734,
                        on a $1 million loan at 3% for 50 years.)</p>
                    <p>Loans on terms less lenient to the borrower may be made when in the opinion
                        of <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> such loans can be made without
                        sacrificing important U.S. objectives in the Mutual Security Program.</p>
                    <p>The choice between payments to the U.S. Government in dollars and payments in
                        local currency will be made by a borrowing government and incorporated in
                        the loan agreement at the time of signature. At any time during the life of
                        a loan agreement providing for local currency repayment the borrowing
                        government will have the right to transfer irrevocably from the local
                        currency basis of repayment to the dollar basis of repayment.</p>
                    <p>If repayment is to be in local currency the obligation to repay will be
                        denominated in dollars with provision for payment in the local currency
                        equivalent of those dollars at the appropriate exchange rate current at the
                        time of repayment. Each borrowing government will be required to agree that
                        local currency paid to the U.S. under a loan agreement will be usable at a
                        minimum for any expenditures or payments of the U.S. Government in the
                        country or overseas territories of the borrowing government and that any
                        restrictions placed by the borrowing government upon other uses of the local
                        currency paid to the U.S. Government will not be more onerous than the
                        restrictions limiting the use of the local currency by U.S. citizens.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. will agree to take into consideration the economic position of the
                        borrowing country in any contemplated use of the local currency repaid by a
                        borrowing country.</p>
                    <p>Loan agreements will allow the borrowers the option of prepayment.</p>
                    <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0398"/>
                    <p>Loan agreements will take note of the possibility that the U.S. may wish at a
                        later date to suggest renegotiation of the agreements to provide for direct
                        repayment in strategic materials or other valuable considerations, and each
                        agreement will generally provide that, if, at any time so long as the U.S.
                        Government is the holder of the obligations under the agreement, the parties
                        to the agreement determine that it would be in their common interests they
                        may by mutual agreement, modify the agreement.</p>
                    <p>Each loan agreement will provide that the U.S., in consultation with the
                        borrowing government, may convert the dollar obligations it holds under the
                        agreement into negotiable bonds in convenient denominations for sales to
                        investors.</p>
                    <p>Loans will be offered in the following approximate amounts: <table rows="17"

                    <p>The Council met to consider the <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> loan

                        Hall stated that <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> had nothing further to
                        add to the paper. Mr. Burgess commented that the proposed program raised
                        questions with respect to (1) the term of the loans and the rate of interest
                        to be charged, (2) the renegotiation formula, (3) the allocation of loan
                        amounts by countries, and (4) continuing <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                        review of the program. He asked for discussion of these issues. Mr. Brundage
                        stated that two questions which were of interest to the Bureau of the Budget
                        were the problem of choice of loans rather than grants and the uses to which
                        the U.S. Government would be able to put local currency proceeds.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Overby indicated that the Treasury Department would like to see the
                        interest rate set at the nearest ½ percent above the cost of money to the
                        U.S. Government for comparable maturities. On this basis the proposed rates
                        of 3 and 4 percent would be acceptable for the time being, but he felt that
                        they should be subject to review. With respect to the maximum term of the
                        loans, Mr. Overby preferred 30 years to 50. Mr. Hall felt that it was better
                        for the U.S. to be lenient on the terms rather than on other aspects of the
                        loans, and pointed out that a 50-year term would help to minimize possible
                        conflicts with repayment schedules of Export-Import Bank and International
                        Bank loans. Mr. Waugh argued in favor of longer rather than shorter terms. A
                        discussion ensued in which various aspects of the interest rates and the
                        term of the loans were explored thoroughly. Following this discussion the
                        Council agreed to approve for the time being the 3 and 4 percent minimum
                        rates for loans repayable in dollars and local currencies, respectively, and
                        to accept the <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> proposal to make the loans
                        repayable in not more than 50 years, with the expectation that <gloss
                            target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> would renegotiate the loans before the end
                        of the 50-year period whenever conditions made renegotiation
                        appropriate.</p>
                    <p>The Council then discussed the formula for renegotiation. General Edgerton
                        expressed the view that there was need in a 50-year loan for a provision for
                        renegotiation in case conditions change. It was suggested that it would be
                        desirable to make definite provision for renegotiation in the loan
                        contracts, and that this could be accomplished by writing the loans with a
                        25-year term with the identical repayment schedule proposed by <gloss
                            target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> for 50-year loans, making the balance
                        unpaid at the end of 25 years due and payable at that time, subject to
                        renegotiation. It was argued that this would provide a positive incentive
                        for renegotiation at a stated time. These suggestions and other possible
                        means of handling the question <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0401"/>of
                        renegotiation were discussed at length. The Council agreed at the conclusion
                        of this discussion that the general formula for renegotiation stated in
                        paragraph 4 on page 3 of Document No. 1690 was an acceptable formula and
                        need not be changed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Overby requested clarification of the language in paragraph 1 on page 3,
                        relating to restrictions on the purposes for which the United States
                        Government might use local currency, pointing out that such language might
                        provide an incentive for borrowing governments to impose or increase
                        restrictions on the use of local currency by private citizens. Mr. Willis
                        pointed out that the language might alternatively be interpreted as making
                        the loans very hard in the event convertibility is achieved. Mr. Bennett
                        indicated that the language was intended to mean simply that U.S. Government
                        holdings of local currency would not be subjected to discriminatory
                        restrictions in the event of convertibility for other foreign balances.
                        After discussion, it was agreed that more general language, such as that
                        proposed by Mr. Dembitz at the meeting, should be substituted for the
                        language in the paper.</p>
                    <p>The Council then considered the problem of allocating the loan amounts by
                        countries. The statutory requirement of making loans of $200 million and the
                        Congressional desire for a higher figure if possible were explained to the
                        Council. Mr. Waugh stated that the Department of State had not had an
                        opportunity as yet to examine the proposed area and country amounts and
                        wished to have time to do so. He appreciated the desire of <gloss
                            target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> to begin operations promptly under the
                        program and he felt that State would be able to make its view known quickly
                        so as to avoid delay. It was agreed, after some discussion, that the Council
                        would approve the suggested program for development assistance and
                        defense-support loans, subject to <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>’s
                        reviewing the individual country programs in consultation with the
                        Department of State, and that the program for military assistance loans
                        would be submitted to the Council at a later date. It was agreed that any
                        significant variations in the program or in the amounts proposed for
                        particular countries would be referred back to the <gloss target="#t_NAC1"
                            >NAC</gloss>. The representative of the Bureau of the Budget stated that
                        the Bureau had an interest in the country allocations, and intended to make
                        the allocations subject to the usual apportionment procedure of the Bureau
                        of the Budget.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman suggested, as a means for providing continuing <gloss
                            target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> review of the program, the <gloss
                            target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> keep the Council informed of the progress
                        under the program so that Council agencies would have opportunity to request
                        discussion or raise objection if they felt it necessary.</p>
                    <p>Col. Wilson offered substitute language for a portion of the text describing
                        the military assistance loan program (p. 4), which was <pb n="376"
                            xml:id="pg_376" facs="0402"/>accepted by the Council. Certain minor
                        changes to the paper were agreed. The Council directed the Secretariat to
                        revise the paper in accordance with the discussion (see <gloss

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Glendinning</hi>: The recent shift in
                        international trade conditions from a seller’s to a buyer’s market abroad,
                        the increasing importance of export markets to United States manufacturers
                        because of expansion of plant capacity, and the increasing credit
                        competition offered by foreign manufacturers based on assistance provided by
                        their governments, make it desirable for the Export-Import Bank to adopt
                        procedures to expedite the extension of assistance to United States
                        exporters of capital goods without sacrificing sound principals of
                        finance.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, the Bank proposes, within the field in which it could
                        appropriately extend exporter credits on a case by case basis, also to
                        extend lines of credit to assist exporters of certain types of capital
                        equipment to meet competition in established United States markets abroad.
                        This proposal rests upon the premise that certain <pb n="377"
                            xml:id="pg_377" facs="0403"/>types of capital goods will be required
                        year after year in a particular country, will improve or continue to sustain
                        the economy of that country and, based upon past experience, can be sold
                        there for dollars in a certain volume each year without injury to our
                        overall trade position. Such a procedure would not minimize the importance
                        of or be inconsistent with consideration on their merits of either projects
                        of a developmental type or exporter credits for the expansion of exports as
                        distinct from their maintenance at appropriate levels.</p>
                    <p>Such a line of credit would not be expected to finance more than a portion of
                        the business of a particular exporter of capital equipment. The
                        establishment of such a line for his assistance, however, would enable the
                        exporter to know the extent of the aid he might anticipate from the Bank in
                        a given period and thus permit him rationally to plan the extension where
                        necessary of credit terms to his foreign dealers or other customers.
                        Moreover, the line of credit from the Bank could be arranged and used more
                        effectively to supplement and complement the exporters’ own resources and
                        his lines of credit from commercial institutions.</p>
                    <p>The contemplated procedure is not entirely new to the Bank. Somewhat similar
                        lines of credit have been extended to assist groups of manufacturers in the
                        machine tool industry. These revolving credits have operated successfully
                        and without loss. The creation of such groups, however, is not practicable
                        or appropriate for most types of equipment.</p>
                    <p>The Bank proposes, in short, to authorize a line of credit to assist an
                        individual company in an amount of not more than one-third to approximately
                        one-half of the average foreign business done by it during the last few
                        years. At the outset, no line would be authorized in excess of $10 million,
                        or would be available for more than one year, until some experience with
                        this device has been gained.</p>
                    <p>After such authorization, application could be made to the Bank by the
                        exporter for financial assistance under the line in making a sale in any
                        friendly country on a case by case basis. Where the nature of the goods
                        permits of repetitive sales to the same customer abroad during a year,
                        provision would be made for utilization of the line without prior approval
                        by the Bank of each such transaction. For these cases the Bank will
                        designate from time to time the countries in which such transactions may be
                        financed automatically, and the amount of credit which may be outstanding at
                        any one time in each approved country. As a further prerequisite to such
                        transactions, the Bank also will designate from time to time the amount of
                        credit which may be outstanding at any one time to an approved importer in
                        that country. The provisions for such automatic <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378"
                            facs="0404"/>treatment, however, are not to apply to sales where the
                        purchaser is a government or government owned entity.</p>
                    <p>In connection with each sale to be financed under an exporter credit line, a
                        down payment of at least 20% of the invoice value must be obtained by the
                        exporter unless otherwise approved by the Bank. The exporter will be
                        expected generally to participate in the financing by carrying not less than
                        25% of the balance or financed portion of the sale. The Bank, then, will
                        purchase or guarantee not more than 75% of the financed portion. This
                        financing would be without recourse to the exporter and would be pari passu
                        with the 25% or more which he would carry for his own account or with the
                        assistance of his commercial bank or other financial institution. On this
                        basis the amount to be financed by the Bank would not exceed 60% of the
                        invoice value of the item sold.</p>
                    <p>The maturity of the paper to be purchased or guaranteed would vary according
                        to the nature of the equipment to be financed and to some extent with the
                        competitive terms offered. It is believed the terms should not exceed and
                        usually should be shorter than those offered by competitors, but seldom
                        should be for periods of less than 1 year. For some types of equipment terms
                        of 2 or 3 years will be adequate. For others, terms of about 5 years may be
                        required, and for large units of heavy equipment there will be occasions
                        when terms of 7 years or so will be necessary. The desire to extend
                        excessive terms will be minimized, it is believed, because the exporter will
                        be required to participate ratably for the full period. It should generally
                        be possible to finance through private channels products for which credit
                        terms of less than one year are appropriate.</p>
                    <p>The paper to be purchased or guaranteed usually will bear interest at not
                        less than 5% per annum. There may be some instances, however, in which
                        approved sales to governments or their entities may require use of 4½% as
                        the rate of interest. Interest will at least equal minimum requirements of
                        the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> formula. Interest and installments
                        of principal are to be payable not less often than semiannually.</p>
                    <p>The Bank proposes to charge a commission on all obligations purchased or
                        guaranteed by it. The commission, payable by the exporter when the Bank
                        assumes responsibility for the paper, will be 1½% flat on obligations having
                        a final maturity of 3 years or less, and will be increased by ¼% for each
                        year or portion thereof by which the maturity of the last maturing
                        obligation exceeds 3 years.</p>
                    <p>Some exporters have indicated that they can provide the financing required
                        for the sales which are to be assisted if the Bank will extend its guaranty
                        to the exporter in lieu of arranging for purchase of the paper. In the
                        majority of cases, however, it is the intention <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379"
                            facs="0405"/>that these purchases shall be made by commercial banks
                        designated by the exporter with the guarantee of the Export-Import Bank.
                        Accordingly, it will be necessary to enter into guaranty agreements with
                        these commercial banks. The Export-Import Bank proposes to charge for its
                        guaranty, whether issued to the exporter or to the commercial bank, a fee of
                        2% per annum on the outstanding balance guaranteed if the obligation bears
                        interest at the rate of 5% per annum or less. The guaranty fee will be
                        increased by one-quarter of any amount by which the interest borne by the
                        guaranteed obligation exceeds 5% per annum. The fee would be payable to the
                        Bank from interest collected on the guaranteed obligation.</p>
                    <p>The exporter is to be responsible for determining that all requirements
                        incident to the right to obtain dollar exchange to meet installments on the
                        importer’s obligations have been complied with by himself or the importer.
                        If this has not been done, the Bank will have recourse against the exporter
                        in connection with the particular transaction.</p>
                    <p>A few exporters are prepared to assume all commercial risks involved in their
                        sales abroad on credit, but have indicated that if they are to do so they
                        require protection against loss resulting from political occurrences beyond
                        the control of the exporter or the importer. Such risks include
                        inconvertibility, war and, possibly in some cases, expropriation. The Bank,
                        therefore, proposes to offer limited guaranties which would vary from those
                        for total coverage under lines of credit as discussed above in the following
                        respects: (1) Instead of purchasing or guaranteeing the paper in the first
                        instance, the Bank will agree to make such purchase within 180 days after
                        occurence of a default resulting solely from a defined political risk; (2)
                        the Bank’s undertaking would cover 75% of the financed portion of the sale
                        after provision for a cash down payment of 20% of the invoice value; (3) the
                        commission charged the exporter by the Bank at the time of assuming
                        responsibility would be ¾% of the obligations covered by the Bank’s
                        undertaking for obligations having a final maturity of 3 years or less, plus
                        ¼% for each year or fraction thereof by which the maturity of the last
                        maturing obligation exceeds 3 years; and (4) the Bank will receive a premium
                        of 1¾% per annum payable at least semiannually if the obligations of the
                        importer bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum, plus one-quarter of any
                        amount of interest in excess of 5% borne by the obligations.</p>

                                exchange problem. Any sales in such countries will require prior

                                    >Supra</hi></ref>.</note> containing an Export-Import Bank
                        proposal for a program of exporter lines of credit. The Chairman invited the
                        representative of the Export-Import Bank to explain the program. Mr. Arey
                        commented that in many respects the program is not new, pointing out that
                        the Bank had made exporter credits for many years and has had experience
                        with lines of credit in certain fields. He felt that the really new thing
                        about the program is the advance assurance it would offer to the exporter of
                        access to the Bank’s resources under specified conditions. He described the
                        features of the automatic and non-automatic lines of credit contemplated in
                        the plan, and indicated that a significant advantage of this approach is in
                        the possession by the Bank of comprehensive knowledge of the exporter’s
                        business, which should expedite actual operations under the lines of credit.
                        He noted that an exporter newly entering the field would be treated on a
                        case-by-case basis until he built up a record which might enable him to
                        obtain a line of credit. He outlined the minimum standards for down payments
                        and exporter participation under lines of credit, and discussed the interest
                        rate and commitment charge provisions which the Bank contemplated. He
                        described the safeguards which the Bank has worked out to insure that
                        particular firms are not unduly assisted to the injury of others and
                        discussed briefly the two illustrative cases outlined in the paper.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Overby raised the question of the extent to which this program would
                        compete with private groups in the same field. Mr. Arey <pb n="382"
                            xml:id="pg_382" facs="0408"/>replied that the Bank has discussed the
                        program with the Chase National Bank group which is preparing to enter the
                        medium-term export financing field and felt that there would be no conflict
                        between the two plans Mr. Marget recalled that the Federal Reserve Board had
                        recently altered its regulations to enable the Chase group to organize a
                        corporation for this purpose. He therefore hoped that the Export-Import Bank
                        plan would not offer any undue competition to the private venture. He hoped
                        that to the extent private groups became able to handle export financing,
                        the Export-Import Bank would withdraw from the field, and he noted that this
                        would imply constant scrutiny by the <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1"
                            >Eximbank</gloss> of its own operations to be sure that it was not
                        competing with private capital. Thus, for example, <gloss
                            target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss> would have to watch its
                        interest rates in comparison with the rates charged by private groups. Mr.
                        Arey replied that he was sure that the Chase group was satisfied that the
                            <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss> plan would not hinder
                        them, and noted that the <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss>
                        always desires to encourage private lending. He indicated that the terms to
                        be offered by the Chase group seemed relatively advantageous to the exporter
                        as compared to the terms contemplated by the <gloss
                            target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss>. The <gloss
                            target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss> feels that it must direct its
                        financing toward the sale of goods that will improve U.S. markets abroad.
                        Therefore, the <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss> program
                        would be limited to financing capital goods which would tend to improve the
                        economies of the importing countries even though they may not necessarily
                        result in immediate production of dollar exchange. He felt that the Chase
                        group might limit its transactions in the same way. He noted that the
                        problem of the United Kingdom is quite different from the problem of the
                        United States, in that the U.K. wishes to promote sales of consumer goods to
                        obtain immediate earnings of foreign exchange for Britain.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Marget expressed the hope the monthly reports by the Bank to the <gloss
                            target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> would include data on transactions in
                        particular countries. Mr. Arey replied that the Bank contemplated reporting
                        amounts allocated to particular companies and also amounts allocated and
                        disbursed in particular countries. The Bank did not intend, however, to
                        report allocations or disbursements by country for each company, nor to
                        publish a list of countries which would be eligible for lines of credit. The
                        Chairman noted the importance to the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> of
                        watching the position of particular countries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Waugh stated that the plan seemed acceptable to the State Department, but
                        he wished that the Council had more time to consider it. Mr. Arey indicated
                        that he appreciated the time problem of the Council. He noted that the Staff
                        Committee had spent nearly a whole day on the plan and that the Bank was not
                        urging <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> action in undue haste. The Bank
                        hoped for Council decision by November <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383"
                            facs="0409"/>8 or 9 to enable them to announce the plan to the press by
                        about November 11, after talks with the two companies whose applications
                        were ready for approval.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Burgess stated that the <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss>
                        should make clear in its press release that no conflict was intended with
                        the Chase and other private groups in this field and should emphasize the
                        intention of the Bank to promote the use of private capital. Mr. Overby
                        thought it should be made clear that the <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1"
                            >Eximbank</gloss> is willing to withdraw from the field to the extent
                        that private firms are prepared to enter it. He wondered whether this kind
                        of proposal might at some point relieve the desirable pressure on commercial
                        banks to enter the field of financing foreign trade. Mr. Southard suggested
                        that a few years of favorable experience by the <gloss
                            target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss> might pave the way for the
                        entry of commercial banks into the field. Mr. Arey felt that the principal
                        deterrent to commercial banks was the transfer problem rather than the
                        credit problem, and that if the <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1"
                            >Eximbank</gloss> assumes the transfer risks the commercial banks may be
                        willing to handle the credit risks. Mr. Anderson agreed with Mr. Overby’s
                        view that the <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss> should be
                        willing to withdraw to the extent that private firms were willing to enter
                        the field. He felt that the Chase Bank plan offered more attractive points
                        than the Export-Import Bank plan, and hoped that the success of the Chase
                        group would cause other private firms to enter the field.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Marget called attention to the significance of the institutional change
                        in the structure of American banking heralded by the Chase venture. Mr.
                        Waugh felt that the present time is a period of transition in U.S. banking,
                        with U.S. banks gradually entering the foreign field. He felt that this plan
                        would inevitably encourage U.S. exports and therefore increase our trade
                        imbalance and felt that the plan should not yet be considered a finished
                        product. Mr. Arey indicated that in developing the plan the <gloss
                            target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss> was careful to preserve the
                        principle of selectivity in financing, and hoped that the plan would offset
                        pressures for blanket export insurance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hall raised the question of the relationship of the guarantee aspects of
                        the plan to the <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> guarantees. Mr. Arey
                        replied that all <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> guarantees concern
                        equity investments rather than loans and that the <gloss
                            target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss> did not anticipate any
                        conflict with the <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> program. Mr. Hall
                        hoped that the Bank and <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> would maintain a
                        close relationship on these programs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brundage expressed approval of the limitations and safeguards in the
                        plan, especially its limitation to the financing of capital goods, and the
                        intention to defer to commercial banks.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Overby stated that the program must be viewed as experimental with the
                        promotion of private enterprise in mind, that it should be kept in line with
                        other U.S. policies in the foreign economic <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384"
                            facs="0410"/>field, and that it should take into account the effect of
                        the growth of supplier credits on the field for development credits.</p>
                    <p>The Council discussed briefly the proposed announcement of the plan to the
                        public. Mr. Arey indicated that following the brief announcement to the
                        press around November 11 <gloss target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss>
                        proposed to submit a detailed story for publication in the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Foreign Commerce Weekly.</hi></p>
                    <p>The Chairman then summarized the discussion, indicating that it was agreed
                        that the plan was experimental. He noted that it offered the immediate
                        advantage of a positive proposal for the Rio Conference,<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d121fn2">Reference is to the Meeting of Ministers of Finance or

                        suggested that the Council review the entire program in six months on the
                        basis of reports of the Export-Import Bank. The Council then approved the

                        Board the Department gave its tentative views on the study of US civil
                        aviation operations via the North Atlantic which is pending before the Board
                        and which must be completed by July 1952, when the certificates now held by
                        PanAm and <gloss target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss> are due to expire. We stressed
                        that our views are tentative and subject to revision as the proceeding
                        unfolds, but we are at this time of the opinion that: 1) a return to the
                        area service concept is advisable rather than a continuance of
                        point-to-point competition; 2) the national interest requires continued
                        certification of carriers to serve points for which carriers are now
                        certificated and to which service is provided; and 3) that limited
                        certificates rather than those of permanent duration have definite
                        advantages from the national interest standpoint. We feel also that service
                        should continue to be certificated to points behind the Iron Curtain even
                        though they may not be served at this time since they compose a part of a
                        comprehensive route pattern for Europe.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Background.</hi> In July, 1952 the two international
                        carriers flying the North Atlantic routes to points in Europe, North Africa,
                        and the Near and Middle East will require new certifications to continue
                        their operations on these routes. It was planned in 1945 when service was
                        established that a complete review of the North Atlantic route pattern would
                        be made in 1952, based upon experience gained during the seven years’ trial
                        period. This procedure was decided upon to allow flexibility in
                        crystallizing permanent route patterns <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386"
                            facs="0412"/>for a rapidly developing infant industry. It also took
                        cognizance of the possibilities of political and economic change and the
                        prospect that our objectives as to traffic development could not be reached
                        in the immediate post-war period. In 1945 three US international carriers,
                        Pan American, American Overseas Airways, and Trans-World Airways, were
                        authorized to operate over the North Atlantic. Then in July, 1950, PanAm was
                        granted the right to acquire the property, assets and business of <gloss
                            target="#t_AOA1">AOA</gloss> and the authority to fly its routes. At
                        that time, President Truman expressed the desire that a route pattern be
                        established whereby the US international carriers (PanAm and <gloss
                            target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss>) might have the benefit of competition to
                        the principal traffic points in Europe and avoid a monopoly on the part of
                        either of the US carriers. He decided both carriers should be authorized to
                        serve the four European cities which he considered to be the most
                        important—London, Paris, Rome and Frankfort. This became known as the North
                        Atlantic Route Transfer decision and constituted a change in practice from
                        the area service concept whereby our international carriers were generally
                        not permitted to serve identical transfer points to the concept permitting
                        them point-to-point service.</p>
                    <p>In November, 1951 the <gloss target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss> informed the
                        Department that applications had been filed by PanAm and <gloss
                            target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss> requesting the extension, with certain
                        modifications of their respective authorizations to engage in foreign air
                        transportation across the North Atlantic which expire July 4, 1952. In order
                        that the Board might assess thoroughly the entire question of the North
                        Atlantic route pattern, and in view of the increasingly important part
                        international civil aviation is taking in regard to our foreign relations as
                        a whole, the Department’s comments were requested.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Department Views.</hi> Our views are predicated on the
                        assumption that: 1) US international air services should continue to be
                        extensive and should touch most of the countries of the world into which we
                        can gain access on an acceptable basis; and 2) the US should continue its
                        present efforts to maintain a system of maximum competitive freedom in
                        international civil aviation.</p>
                    <p>It is becoming increasingly evident that the favorable position enjoyed by
                        the US in the field of international civil aviation in the years immediately
                        following World War II has considerably altered with the establishment of
                        trunk and, more important, extensive regional services by foreign carriers.
                        Not only is there evidence that we would have great difficulty in expanding
                        our present operating rights abroad, but it is also increasingly apparent
                        that the maintenance of what we now have will be more and more difficult in
                        the period immediately ahead. Therefore, we feel that our present and future
                        negotiating position in civil aviation matters should be thoroughly <pb
                            n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0413"/>considered in the <gloss
                            target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss>’s decision regarding the North Atlantic
                        route pattern.</p>
                    <p>As for specific issues, we recommend a return to the system of area services
                        as the best means of serving US long-range aviation interests. We feel that
                        most of the basic advantages of competition can be obtained through the
                        competition between US carriers and foreign flag carriers. Therefore, it was
                        argued that the public interest would be served most effectively through a
                        system which recognizes the direct competition that exists between US and
                        foreign air carriers but which, at the same time, provides a means for
                        judging the standard of performance of the US carrier through the existence
                        of another such carrier performing comparable services under similar
                        conditions in another area. In addition, the US stands to gain numerous
                        economic advantages from the existence of viable civil air transport
                        enterprises in friendly countries. A return to the area concept should
                        contemplate a fair and equitable allocation of the routes in Europe and the
                        Near and Middle East for the US carriers serving those areas in such a
                        manner as to establish relatively equivalent opportunities for them. It is
                        felt that since we have consistently opposed the “chosen instrument” idea
                        and favored the pattern of several US carriers competing in international
                        air transportation, it is desirable to conduct such competition within
                        reasonable bounds for much of the force of foreign opposition would be
                        diluted by such self-imposed restraint.</p>
                    <p>In general, the Department believes the national interest requires continued
                        certification of carriers to serve points for which carriers are now
                        certified and to which service is provided. Not as yet having had an
                        opportunity to measure suggested solutions to this problem by the criterion
                        of the economic costs of operations, the Department has sought a solution by
                        distinguishing between: 1) points to which the national interest
                        indisputably required certification of US carriers and service by them; and
                        2) points where such requirement cannot be clearly shown but to which
                        certification of a US carrier is desirable.</p>
                    <p>In considering the route pattern and carrier participation for service
                        through the Middle East, account should be taken of the services now being
                        operated by US carriers in that region, the local arrangements and
                        obligations assumed by those carriers, and the political relations between
                        the US and the countries in the region. Requesting that the Department have
                        an opportunity for consideration of any proposal for elimination of service
                        to any points currently served in that area, or a reallocation of existing
                        route patterns which might affect services presently operated in that area,
                        we recommended that two carrier services be continued at least as far east
                        as India.</p>
                    <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0414"/>
                    <p>We have recommended that the certificates to be issued in July should be of
                        limited duration rather than permanent, because we believe that
                        international air transport is still in the process of development and
                        freezing the present route pattern is undesirable. Furthermore, rapidly
                        changing political conditions in the entire world require some flexibility,
                        and the ability of the US Government to review the situation periodically
                        serves as a reminder to the carriers that their conduct of business in the
                        national interest would be one of the factors considered in renewing their
                        certificates from time to time. This recommendation was made on the
                        assumption that it will be possible to treat both carriers operating over
                        the North Atlantic in the same manner. Therefore, since it is understood
                        that PanAm enjoys permanent certification over a portion of its routes, the
                        recommendation that certificates of limited duration be issued would be
                        modified should the Board not find it possible to change these certificates
                        by limiting them to specific terms. In this case, it would be recommended
                        that <gloss target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss> be given permanent certifications
                        of comparable importance and that all other certifications be of a limited
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the Board’s inquiry as to the advisability of certificating
                        presently authorized points which are not now served, we believe it
                        desirable to include points necessary for a comprehensive pattern for
                        service to all the areas reached by way of the North Atlantic even though
                        service to those points may not be possible at the present time. On this
                        assumption, the Department believes that it would be appropriate from the
                        standpoint of foreign relations to include points in the Soviet orbit
                        necessary to form a comprehensive air transport service pattern. However, it
                        is emphasized that in view of the fluidity of US-Soviet relations, requiring
                        continuous reappraisal of all aspects of these relations, the Department may
                        wish to make additional comments on this particular issue in the light of
                        developments during the progress in the case.</p>
                    <p>The problems of providing air service into and through Germany are unique and
                        will remain so as long as Germany is divided and Berlin must be treated as a
                        special circumstance. These problems emphasize the desirability of temporary
                        rather than permanent certification. For the present it is believed
                        sufficient to either: 1) certificate both US carriers on a temporary basis
                        to serve Berlin; 2) enable both to provide service under temporary,
                        extendable exemption orders; or 3) insure adequate service through a
                        combination of these methods. We feel that both carriers should also, for
                        the foreseeable future, be authorized to continue their Frankfort services.
                        At the present time it appears necessary that service to Munich,
                        Cologne–Dusseldorf, Hamburg and Bremen be authorized, with one-carrier
                        service to each of these points being adequate. No service <pb n="389"
                            xml:id="pg_389" facs="0415"/>need be provided to Stuttgart at this time.
                        The majority of points presently authorized for service and served required
                        no additional comment.</p>

                        <item>Technical Assistance Programs in Civil Aviation</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The situation with respect to U.S. technical assistance to foreign countries
                        in the field of aviation is one which should give rise to serious concern on
                        the part of the U.S. Government, in my opinion. In general, the U.S. does
                        not appear to be engaging in a sufficiently vigorous bilateral technical
                        assistance program. This deficiency appears to be particularly acute in the
                            <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> area. In raising this subject, I
                        would like to set forth certain assumptions upon which this memorandum is
                        based. These assumptions are: (1) No suggestion is being made to the effect
                        that a higher priority should be given to aviation technical assistance in
                        relation to non-aviation projects than is currently the case. (2) It is not
                        intended to imply that the U.S. Government should compete with <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agencies in offering technical assistance, or
                        that pressure should be placed upon foreign governments to induce them to
                        request U.S. rather than <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss>
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>Technical assistance to foreign governments designed to raise the standard of
                        their civil air power in all its aspects (air transport, ground facilities,
                        techniques and administration) has in most cases important political and
                        strategic implications to the U.S. which are not necessarily applicable to
                        technical assistance in other fields such as agriculture and health. Because
                        of this fact the motivation behind the interest of the U.S. in aviation
                        technical assistance should differ to a considerable degree from that which
                        leads us to promote programs designed generally to raise the standard of
                        living and social conditions in foreign countries.</p>
                    <p>Technical assistance in aviation serves the following purposes: (a) It
                        increases the defense potential of the recipient nation by improving its air
                        power potential, (b) It improves facilities which the U.S. and her allies
                        may require during an all-out emergency, (c) It promotes <pb n="390"
                            xml:id="pg_390" facs="0416"/>the sale of U.S. manufactured aeronautical
                        equipment and matériel, thus developing long term markets for an industry
                        essential to national defense, (d) It promotes the adoption of U.S.
                        techniques, which in turn serves to assist in furthering (b) and (c) above.
                        (e) It provides the U.S. Government with intelligence opportunities with
                        respect to an activity of great military importance.</p>
                    <p>The above list is not intended to be exhaustive and deliberately omits
                        mention of the benefits in terms of economic development which accrue from
                        well-developed air transport in an area such as the Near and Middle East.
                        The omission of mention of this factor is deliberate in view of assumption
                        No. (1) above.</p>
                    <p>If the above listed benefits accruing to the U.S. from aviation technical
                        assistance are accepted as being valid, it would appear that technical
                        assistance programs now under way or planned are inadequate both in number
                        and in character. With the exception of Greece, the only U.S. aviation
                        technical assistance now being rendered in the <gloss target="#t_NEA1"
                            >NEA</gloss> area is of a “spot” character. We have no missions in the
                        field nor do we have any requests for assistance of a comprehensive nature.
                        This situation has been brought about as I see it for three major reasons.
                        (1) The failure of the U.S. to be aggressive in “selling” its technical
                        assistance capabilities to foreign governments. (2) Our timidity in
                        encouraging a foreign government to seek American assistance once that
                        government or <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> has entered into
                        discussions regarding the possibilities of <gloss target="#t_ICAO1"
                            >ICAO</gloss> assistance. (3) The preference shown on the part of some
                        governments for assistance from an international body as opposed to
                        bilateral programs which, it is feared, may have strings attached.</p>
                    <p>There is probably little that can be done with respect to the desire of
                        foreign governments to seek international rather than bilateral assistance.
                        Only time and experience can prove that the U.S. Government does not use its
                        offers of assistance as a means of exploitation.</p>
                    <p>With respect to our failure to make known to foreign governments our
                        capabilities in the field of technical assistance, the ground which has been
                        lost could perhaps be recovered in part at least by an aggressive
                        informational campaign. The question of the relationship of <gloss
                            target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> to the U.S. in the field of technical
                        assistance is a difficult one, however it is my impression that we are in
                        many cases failing to achieve our legitimate objectives by following an
                        unrealistic policy of undue deference to <gloss target="#t_ICAO1"
                            >ICAO</gloss>. A reexamination of our policy appears called for.</p>
                    <p>In the first place, the desire to avoid duplicating efforts in a given
                        country appears to be so sound as to be beyond question. As a consequence,
                        the U.S. has not sought to mount a bilateral program where <gloss
                            target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> is already on the job. Unfortunately,
                        however, <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0417"/><gloss target="#t_ICAO1"
                            >ICAO</gloss> has not always reciprocated in this policy. Both in Greece
                        and in Turkey <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> representatives have
                        aggressively and actively sought to inject <gloss target="#t_ICAO1"
                            >ICAO</gloss> into the picture in spite of the difficulties which this
                        will, and already has, caused the U.S. Secondly, the U.S. has been so timid
                        that we have avoided even suggesting to a foreign government that a better

                        through <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> where practical difficulties
                        exist within the <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> organization limiting
                        the effectiveness of the program. This timidity on our part appears to
                        indicate that we are more concerned with the form than we are with the
                        substance in that greater weight is given to the question of what agency
                        should do the job than to the best method by which the job can properly and
                        effectively be accomplished. This is not intended to imply that in all cases
                        a bilateral program by the U.S. offers the best technical assistance. On the
                        other hand, we should not fail to recognize that in most cases the U.S. can
                        provide a better program with better technical backstopping than can <gloss

                        Policy</hi></p>
                    <p>A newly adopted US policy on international television standardization
                        provides for our advocating adoption by other countries of the same
                        technical standards for operation of their television systems as have been
                        adopted by the US or for adoption of standards compatible with ours. This is
                        considered necessary to facilitate the eventual interchange of programs,
                        free interchange of transmitting and receiving equipment, and for greater
                        and more efficient utilization of the radio spectrum. The progress of
                        television development in various parts of the world and its establishment
                        in some countries of the Western Hemisphere have emphasized that the future
                        interests of this country may be jeopardized if the US fails to work
                        actively for compatible television standards and finds itself in an isolated
                        position. This is particularly important so far as other countries of the
                        Western Hemisphere are concerned because it is, of course, technically
                        possible at this time to establish links between those countries which will
                        permit the interchange of programs.</p>
                    <p>A meeting of the television study group of the International Radio
                        Consultative Committee (CCIR) scheduled for May in Stockholm prompted urgent
                        action on our part so that the US delegation would be prepared to present a
                        positive position in support of our television standards or compatible ones.
                        We have had indications that there is certain dissatisfaction with the
                        performance characteristics of the 625 line system now largely utilized in
                        Europe, that there is a tendency to favor the 525 line US standards instead,
                        and that the Netherlands interests will raise this question at the
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Background.</hi> The first discussion of television on a
                        government level took place at the CCIR Plenary Assembly at Stockholm in
                        1948 at which time a television group was set up to study and make
                        recommendations on the possibilities of the international <pb n="393"
                            xml:id="pg_393" facs="0419"/>standardization of television systems to
                        facilitate interchange of programs. The study group’s first meeting was held
                        in Zurich in 1949 where four different systems were proposed for worldwide
                        adoption. The 405 line system was in use in the UK, the 525 line system was
                        in use in the US, the 625 line system was used experimentally in and
                        proposed by the Netherlands, and the 819 line system had been adopted as the
                        operating standard in France for a ten-year period. In doing this, however,
                        the French operating agency was also committed to transmit on standards of
                        441 lines, which had previously been in use in France, for the same period
                        of time.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that the four proposed systems should be viewed in operation in
                        order better to appraise their quality of performance, and demonstrations
                        were accordingly held in the US, France, the Netherlands, and the UK in
                        spring, 1950. A study group meeting followed in London at which seven
                        countries of continental Europe declared themselves in favor of the 625 line
                        system advocated by the Dutch and compatible with US standards. These
                        countries invited France and the UK to consider joining them in
                        standardizing television for Europe on the 625 line system. Later in 1950,
                        countries interested in the 625 line system met in Geneva and worked out the
                        complete set of standards based on this system. The UK, US and France were
                        represented.</p>
                    <p>Results of the television study group’s discussions were submitted to the
                        CCIR Plenary Assembly in 1951 at Geneva. General agreement was reached on
                        many of the component characteristics common to all systems. The majority of
                        the interested continental European countries expressed their interest again
                        in establishing the 625 line system, but the principal users of other
                        systems (including the US) were not in a position to agree to change their
                        established operating standards. The US remained in a favorable position,
                        however, when the decision was taken in favor of the 625 line system because
                        it is compatible with the US system.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Technical Considerations.</hi> In approaching the problem
                        of the international standardization of television systems, there are
                        several technical questions which must be weighed. These questions and their
                        significance arise in relation to the three major policy objectives which
                        standardization would bring about: 1) the interchange of programs; 2) the
                        international interchange of equipment and techniques; and 3) the more
                        effective utilization of the radio spectrum.</p>
                    <p>The direct interchange of programs is not presently feasible between
                        countries separated by extensive water areas. Repeated relaying is required
                        to cover large distances of the order of several hundreds or thousands of
                        miles and such relaying cannot now be <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394"
                            facs="0420"/>accomplished economically over water. There does not seem
                        to be any reasonable prospect that such exchange will be feasible within the
                        foreseeable future. Within regions, such as the European continent or
                        American continents, however, exchange is a practicability. Interchange is
                        not likely to be practical immediately throughout the length of the American
                        land areas, but sufficient interchange between adjacent countries may occur,
                        making uniform standards desirable.</p>
                    <p>All methods for the direct or instantaneous interchange of programs between
                        television stations require that the several stations involved in the
                        simultaneous broadcast operate on the same standards with regard to the same
                        number of pictures per second and lines per picture. There have been
                        proposals and some experimental work, looking toward equipment which will
                        make possible an immediate translation of program material from one set of
                        standards to another but, in this country at least, there has been no
                        commercial equipment of this type available. However, the experimental work
                        looks promising and it is quite possible that a successful development will
                        occur within the next few years.</p>
                    <p>At first it would appear that the international sale or exchange of equipment
                        would be facilitated by having international standards. However, this
                        problem is complicated by the existence of electrical power systems of
                        different characteristics in the various countries. Differences in power
                        voltages pose some problems as to interchangeability, but their solution is
                        relatively simple, provided that the differences are anticipated in the
                        design and manufacture of the television equipment. A second and more
                        serious group of problems arises from differences in the frequency of the
                        power stations. These problems are soluble provided they are anticipated at
                        the design stage of the equipment since solution may involve additional
                        filtering, shielding and parts placement in order to minimize the effects of
                        power supply “hum” on the reproduced pictures.</p>
                    <p>The allocation of frequencies and the efficiency of frequency utilization is
                        affected materially by the selection of television standards. The width of
                        the television channel is determined by many technical factors, and the
                        selection of specific channel widths and transmission specifications is a
                        compromise of many conflicting factors. The distance at which assignments
                        may be duplicated with a tolerable degree of interference between stations
                        also affects selection of standards.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Television in Europe.</hi> As a result of adhering to a
                        “hands-off” policy, the US stood to lose its leadership in international

                        validity of the views expressed in its letter to the Board of January 22,
                        1952 and takes this opportunity to reaffirm its previous position.</p>
                    <p>It is noted that the recommendation of the Chief Examiner is for continuing a
                        duplication of service by United States carriers to many traffic points and
                        against a return to the area service concept. Without belaboring this point
                        the Department wishes to record, for the reasons expressed in its letter of
                        January 22, its adherence to its earlier-expressed conviction that the
                        long-range interests of the United States would be best served by a return
                        to an area service concept and the reduction of point-to-point competition
                        between American carriers. It must be recognized that a return to the system
                        of area competition would require, to some extent, changes of routes already
                        being operated. It would seem that it would be relatively easy to make such
                        changes now but that it would become increasingly difficult to do so as
                        continued operations cause the carriers to become more and more firmly
                        entrenched <pb n="396" xml:id="pg_396" facs="0422"/>on the routes. There
                        should also be taken into account the fact that a change now would be made
                        voluntarily by the United States on its own initiative whereas, if the
                        foreign reactions already observed continue, a change at a later date may be
                        forced by the pressure of foreign objections to the growing competition by
                        United States carriers, making it difficult to achieve the orderly and
                        economically desirable arrangements that might now be made voluntarily.</p>
                    <p>The Department also reaffirms its previously expressed view that national
                        interest requirements would be better served by the grant of certificates of
                        limited duration rather than permanent certificates. Certificates of limited
                        duration are important in helping to retain the flexibility necessary to
                        enable the United States Government to adjust to changed conditions when
                        they occur. The Department cannot regard the operating history of our
                        trans-Atlantic services as being sufficiently extensive to enable the
                        Government to make accurate and long-range appraisals of the problem.
                        Despite knowledge gained in the past years of operation, the United States
                        still cannot forecast with any degree of certainty the civil aviation needs
                        of the future sufficiently accurately to justify shackling itself by
                        granting permanent certificates. Moreover, the United States Government is
                        confronted with a growing concern on the part of foreign governments over
                        the competitive impact of operations by United States carriers and at the
                        same time these foreign governments have developed strong protective
                        attitudes toward their own growing carriers. This situation, pointing as it
                        does to a fluid and uncertain aviation picture in the future, emphasizes the
                        importance to the United States Government of retaining the flexibility of
                        certificates of limited duration. Recent experiences in Mexico illustrate
                        the desirability of retaining to the United States Government the ability to
                        adjust outstanding certificates.<note n="3" xml:id="d125fn3">For
                            documentation concerning U.S. efforts to conclude a bilateral aviation

                    <p>In addition to providing flexibility in adjusting to changing international
                        conditions the issuance of certificates of limited duration also provides
                        the United States Government with an element of control over the actions of
                        its carriers. When a carrier is obligated to give an account of its services
                        and its methods of operation at specified intervals, and when the retention
                        of the certificate under which the carrier is operating is dependent in part
                        at least, upon a showing that the carrier’s operations and conduct are in
                        the interest of the United States, that carrier is less likely to develop a
                        history of unsatisfactory operations abroad than is the case when the
                        carrier feels that by reason of possession of a permanent certificate <pb
                            n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0423"/>it is beyond the control of the
                        United States Government. The United States Government has unfortunately few
                        means at its disposal for the control of the international operations of its
                        carriers and it is considered essential therefore that it retain at least
                        the degree of control represented by limiting the duration of
                        certificates.</p>
                    <p>The Department’s position with respect to the duration of the certificates to
                        be issued is modified only to the extent that the Department, being anxious
                        to see the creation of relatively equal conditions of opportunity and
                        stability for both <gloss target="#t_PAA1">PAA</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss>, would urge that permanent certificates
                        necessary to create such substantial equality be issued. Accordingly, the
                        Department urges that no additional permanent certificates be issued to
                            <gloss target="#t_PAA1">PAA</gloss> and that permanent certificates be
                        granted to <gloss target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss> only to the extent necessary
                        to place it in a position substantially equal to that of its competitor.
                        Care should be taken that this substantial equality be an equality in fact
                        rather than merely a seeming equality.</p>
                    <p>Another point on which the Department wishes to comment is the question of
                        whether the certificates should name the particular traffic points to be
                        served or should use the form used in the 1945 Order and provide for
                        intermediate points in specified countries.<note n="4" xml:id="d125fn4"
                            >Reference is to the 1945 <gloss target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss> order
                            certifying transatlantic service for Pan American Airways, Inc.,
                            American Export Airlines, Inc., and Transcontinental and Western Air
                                (<gloss target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss>).</note> The record of past
                        experience clearly indicates that freezing of the service pattern and the
                        consequent loss of ability to adjust periodically the routes of our carriers
                        can seriously handicap the <gloss target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss> as well as
                        the other United States agencies concerned with our international civil
                        aviation. The Chief Examiner based his recommendation for extensive
                        certification of individual points on a conclusion that relative stability
                        has been attained and that there is no longer a need for flexible
                        certification. As has been indicated above in comments on the undesirability
                        of permanent certification the Department does not agree with the Chief
                        Examiner on this point and considers the Chief Examiner’s conclusions to be
                        contrary to the aviation experience of the United States throughout the
                        world. It is considered that the present aviation situation is fluid and
                        developing and that occasions will arise when the Board will find it
                        necessary to adjust the route structure with a minimum of time and
                        procedural difficulty. This can be accomplished more easily if the
                        certificates issued delineate the routes in general terms as far as
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>An illustration of a country where events may require service pattern
                        adjustments is the Federal Republic of Germany. The Department <pb n="398"
                            xml:id="pg_398" facs="0424"/>anticipates the negotiation of an air
                        transport agreement with the Federal Government in the near future To follow
                        the Examiner’s recommendation would result in the authorization of service
                        to seven specific points in Germany whereas there is some question as to
                        whether the United States would consider it desirable to include that many
                        traffic points in its agreement with Germany. It would be desirable in any
                        event to be able to adjust the pattern of United States carrier service to
                        Germany following the negotiation of an air transport agreement and the
                        establishment of a pattern of service by German carriers. The situation in
                        Iraq is equally well known to the Civil Aeronautics Board and is also
                        indicative of the advantage of retaining maximum flexibility through
                        certification of service to a country rather than certification of service
                        to a particular traffic point.<note n="5" xml:id="d125fn5">Reference is to
                            the limitations placed by the Iraqi Government on <gloss

                            led to the withdrawal of U.S. flag carrier service to Baghdad. U.S.
                            service to Basra, in Iraq, was able to continue. Documentation on this
                            subject is in Department of State file 987.52.</note> The difficulty
                        that has arisen in Mexico in part as a result of the certification of United
                        States carriers to serve specified points to and through that country is a
                        further example of the need for preserving freedom of action for the United
                        States Government.</p>
                    <p>In recommending that the certificates be limited in duration and that insofar
                        as possible the certificates should delineate the routes in general terms,
                        the Department believes the considerations underlying these recommendations
                        apply with equal force to the United States civil aviation situation
                        throughout the world and are not confined to the problems presented in this
                        particular case.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the situation east of Cairo the Department wishes to express
                        its wholehearted concurrence in the Chief Examiner’s recommendation for the
                        continuance of the present routes into and through this area and for the
                        continuance of operations by two United States air carriers in the Middle
                        East and South Asia. The growing importance of the Middle East and South
                        Asia to the United States and the importance of the activities of United
                        States air carriers in terms of our foreign relations in that area, make it
                        highly desirable that the existing route structure be maintained without
                        substantial modification, and that there be no substantial reduction of
                        United States airline activity in the region.</p>
                    <p>The United States Government has frequently reiterated the view that
                        international air services should be performed over reasonably direct routes
                        from the points of origin to the points of destination. This position has
                        been taken by the United States in a number of instances when foreign air
                        carriers seeking to establish new routes to the United States have been
                        advised that this Government <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0425"/>could
                        not agree to the establishment of routes which approached the United States
                        in such an indirect manner as to cause doubt whether their purpose was to
                        effect service from the country of origin to the point of destination or was
                        primarily to effect service from some intermediate point to the United
                        States. In view of the position which the United States has taken in this
                        respect it is necessary that the United States avoid establishing routes for
                        its carriers which would themselves be open to the criticism that their main
                        purpose is that of providing service between two foreign points rather than
                        that of providing service from a point in the United States to the point of
                        ultimate destination.</p>
                    <p>The establishment of indirect routes for United States carriers becomes of
                        even more concern when it appears from the United States Government’s own
                        documents that such indirect routes may be established for the primary
                        purpose of carrying fifth freedom traffic.<note n="6" xml:id="d125fn6">Fifth
                            freedom traffic refers to the right to carry air traffic from a point of
                            origin in one foreign country to a point of destination in another
                            foreign country.</note> In the Chief Examiner’s report there have been
                        several references to the fifth freedom traffic which may be generated along
                        the routes recommended. This Department, in common with other Government
                        agencies concerned with international operation of United States airlines,
                        is anxious to insure the full participation of United States air carriers in
                        the traffic which may be generated along their routes. However, it may
                        redound to the disadvantage of the United States if certain routes are
                        justified in the Board’s opinion on the ground that they can be supported by
                        fifth freedom traffic. The Department therefore urges that the Board avoid
                        placing undue emphasis on the dependence of United States carriers on fifth
                        freedom traffic over certain routes. Care should be taken especially in
                        cases where the route segments over which an unusually large percentage of
                        fifth freedom traffic might be carried are served by United States carriers
                        only as the result of substantial deviations from a reasonably direct route.
                        Undoubtedly the Board will be able to justify its decisions without making
                        statements which might be used by other countries as evidence that the
                        routes, or segments thereof, rely on fifth freedom traffic to such an extent
                        that they could not be justified in the absence of fifth freedom traffic.
                        The Board’s cooperation in this matter will, it is believed, help to prevent
                        the creation of unfavorable attitudes abroad and the establishment of
                        arguments which might be used against the United States in future route
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>There remain several specific route questions on which the Department has the
                        following comments.</p>
                    <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0426"/>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Afghanistan</hi>—Although the certification of service to
                        Afghanistan is not recommended in the Chief Examiner’s report, the
                        Department believes it would be in the national interest of the United
                        States to continue certification of service to this country.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Kuwait</hi>—The Department recommends the certification of
                        a United States carrier to serve Kuwait. It is considered that certification
                        of a United States carrier to serve Kuwait could beneficially influence the
                        current difficult situation in Iraq as Kuwait could serve as a potential
                        alternative to a traffic point in Iraq. Since Basra is served by both
                        carriers, the need for service in Kuwait is perhaps debatable. However, it
                        would appear undesirable to create a rigid situation so as to preclude the
                        possibility of an American flag service to this state. Past experience has
                        shown that from a practical point of view the United States Government is in
                        a much stronger position in arranging service to a country named in a
                        certificate than in cases where the country involved has not been so
                        named.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Lisbon</hi>—The Department is concerned over the Examiner’s
                        recommendation that Pan American be certificated to serve Lisbon as an
                        intermediate point between The Azores and Dakar on the South African route.
                        There are a number of factors which give rise to this concern. First, there
                        is the matter of the circuity involved. As pointed out by the Chief Examiner
                        the direct route The Azores–Dakar is 1608 miles whereas the route The
                        Azores–Lisbon–Dakar is 2624 miles, an increase of 1016 miles. Secondly,
                        there is the question of the justification for the service of Lisbon on this
                        route. The Chief Examiner, in discussing the routing via Lisbon, refers to
                        the revenue received by Pan American for traffic carried between Lisbon and
                        other points on the route, inferentially points in Africa. His analysis
                        emphasizes that the prime motivation in directing the South African route
                        through Lisbon is to improve the economy of the operation through the added
                        revenue gained from carrying fifth freedom traffic into and out of Lisbon
                        from points in Africa. In no other way is there offered justification for
                        service of Lisbon on this route. In the face of the foregoing facts, the
                        certification of a carrier to serve Lisbon on the South African route would
                        seem to place the United States Government on record as subscribing to the
                        precept that, in the interest of improving the economy of a route, it is
                        proper and acceptable to deviate substantially from the reasonably direct
                        course in order to gain revenue from fifth freedom traffic thereby. The
                        certification of service on such an indirect route, although it might
                        produce temporary and limited benefits, would be inconsistent with the
                        position of the United States that routes should be reasonably direct. The
                        Department has considered this problem in relation to the problem with the
                        Philippines and <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0427"/>has been unable to
                        escape the conclusion that the certification of a carrier to serve Lisbon on
                        this route would present the Philippines with a very strong argument in
                        support of their request for a stop at Tokyo on the Manila–San Francisco
                        route.</p>
                    <p>There is, moreover, a third factor which causes the Department some concern.
                        As the Board knows, the United States-Portuguese Air Transport Agreement
                        does not provide for a United States route beyond Lisbon to points in West
                        Africa. Pan American’s operation of this service in the past has been on the
                        basis of a special and temporary arrangement with the Portuguese Government,
                        which has consented to this service by Pan American until such time as a
                        Portuguese carrier commences operations between Lisbon and points in West
                        Africa. Statements made by the Portuguese from time to time cause the
                        Department to believe that they would refuse to permit <gloss
                            target="#t_PAA1">PAA</gloss> to continue this service when a Portuguese
                        carrier commences a similar service. It is unlikely, indeed, that the
                        Portuguese would consent to a revision of the Agreement so as to establish
                        this service on a permanent basis. Therefore, the Department believes that
                        if the service to Lisbon is to be continued, it should be continued by the
                        use of exemption orders as is now the case.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Casablanca</hi>—The report of the Chief Examiner recommends
                        that there be granted a certificate for service to Casablanca on the route
                        through Lisbon to South Africa. This Department does not wish to interpose
                        any objection to the certification of a United States carrier to serve
                        Casablanca if service to that point is considered desirable. However, it
                        does wish to bring to the Board’s attention the fact that service to
                        Casablanca cannot be established without the consent of the French
                        Government. Political factors may make it difficult to obtain such consent.
                        The Department also believes that the Board should take into consideration
                        the fact that if <gloss target="#t_PAA1">PAA</gloss> were not granted a
                        certificate to serve Lisbon on the route to South Africa or if the
                        Portuguese Government should reach the conclusion that continued operations
                        at Lisbon on this route were no longer permissible, a service to Casablanca
                        might be as effectively offered on a route across North Africa. It is
                        therefore suggested that the Board give consideration to the relative value
                        of a service to Casablanca (a) on a route to South Africa without a traffic
                        stop at Lisbon, and (b) on a route across North Africa.</p>
                    <p>In the past there have occurred instances when the publication of United
                        States Government decisions relating to air transport operations has brought
                        proposed route changes to the attention of certain foreign governments
                        without those governments’ having been previously advised of the matter
                        through inter-governmental channels, either formal or informal. In such
                        cases the manner in <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0428"/>which the
                        foreign governments became aware of the decisions created difficulties
                        magnified beyond their reasonable import and needlessly complicated the
                        international discussions required to implement the decisions. Therefore,
                        the Department requests the cooperation of the <gloss target="#t_CAB1"
                            >CAB</gloss> in presenting the conclusions and results of the Board’s
                        work in the North Atlantic Route Review Case to foreign governments in the
                        best possible manner. It is recalled that in the <gloss target="#t_PAA1"

                        and the <gloss target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss> cooperated in bringing certain
                        aspects of the decision to the attention of interested governments in
                        advance of publication with excellent results. It is therefore suggested
                        that the Department and the <gloss target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss> cooperate
                        similarly in this case in bringing to the attention of interested
                        governments, in advance of publication or at least simultaneously therewith,
                        aspects of the decision which will affect service to those countries,
                        particularly in cases where modification of the air transport agreements may
                        be required. Sincerely yours,</p>

                    <p>The Civil Aeronautics Board’s North Atlantic Certificate Renewal Decision
                        approved by President Truman on June 28 will permit PanAm and <gloss
                            target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss> to continue their transatlantic operations
                        with certain modifications until July 4, 1959. The decision continues to
                        permit competitive service between our international carriers to major
                        European cities and adheres generally to the basic route pattern which has
                        been followed since 1950. Certificates will be issued to the carriers for a
                        seven year period except for the grant of several permanent points to <gloss
                            target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss>, thereby substantially equalizing its
                        competitive position with that of PanAm. In general, the certificates <pb
                            n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0429"/>will designate countries or areas
                        to be served and will be supplemented by a separate document specifying
                        individual points of service. With a few exceptions, the Department
                        concurred in and supported the Board’s conclusions.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Background.</hi> In 1945 when North Atlantic air service
                        was established by US international air carriers it was planned that a
                        review of the North Atlantic route pattern would be made in 1952 based upon
                        experience gained during the seven years’ trial period. In 1950 when PanAm
                        acquired the property, assets and business of American Overseas Airways and
                        the authority to fly its routes, President Truman decided that both PanAm
                        and <gloss target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss> should be authorized to serve the
                        four European cities which he considered to be the most important—London,
                        Paris, Rome and Frankfort. This became known as the North Atlantic Route
                        Transfer decision and constituted a change in practice from the area service
                        concept, whereby our international carriers were generally not permitted to
                        serve identical transfer points, to the concept of point-to-point service.

                            <ref target="#pg_385">p. 385</ref>.</note> The recent <gloss
                            target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss> decision adheres closely to the findings of
                        the North Atlantic Route Transfer Case.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Routes and Certificates.</hi> In the new decision the Board
                        ruled that, in general, routes would be awarded to the two international
                        carriers on a temporary basis so as to permit more time and flexibility in
                        determining a permanent trans-Atlantic route pattern. However, since PanAm
                        had previously been accorded permanent authority to serve London, Lisbon and
                        Marseilles, <gloss target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss> was granted permanent status
                        to serve the New York–Paris–Rome route via intermediate points in
                        Newfoundland and Ireland. In addition, <gloss target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss>
                        is authorized to serve Kuwait on its flights between Basra and Dhahran, thus
                        linking the major oil centers of the Middle East to the US with a
                        single-carrier service. <gloss target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss> is authorized to
                        serve the Azores on the route between the US and Portugal, and Italy will be
                        added between Tunisia and Egypt. According to the new decision, <gloss
                            target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss> will continue operations to India,
                        specifically Bombay, but not to points further east. The Board is deferring
                        decision on <gloss target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss>’s application to serve
                        points east of India until this question can be considered with Northwest
                        Airlines’ application for extension of its trans-Pacific system to
                        India.</p>
                    <p>PanAm will be certified to serve Nice on its route to Marseilles and its
                        Lisbon–Foynes route has been eliminated. The latter was started during World
                        War II as an emergency measure and has not been used since 1946. For the
                        present PanAm will continue to serve Basra on its Middle East route. PanAm
                        was originally authorized <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0430"/>to
                        operate to Baghdad rather than Basra, but because of inadequate airport
                        facilities at Baghdad, PanAm has been serving Basra instead. Under the new
                        decision, PanAm will continue to serve Iraq with the provision that its
                        service to Basra shall terminate sixty days after the conclusion of mutually
                        satisfactory arrangements between Iraq and the US providing for service to
                        Baghdad. Consistent with the Board’s decision regarding <gloss
                            target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss>’s application to serve points east of
                        India, PanAm will continue to operate its route to Calcutta but
                        consideration of its request for route renewals east of that point is being
                        deferred.</p>
                    <p>On its South Atlantic route, PanAm will be permitted to serve Lisbon and
                        Casablanca as intermediate points between the Azores and Dakar. PanAm’s
                        South Atlantic route operation to Lisbon has until now been covered by an
                        exemption order. PanAm’s certification to operate the South Atlantic route
                        will terminate August 14, 1952 at which time this portion of PanAm’s
                        operations will be reviewed.</p>
                    <p>New York will be the terminal point for both carriers, with Chicago, Detroit,
                        Boston and Philadelphia designated co-terminals. The Board decided that
                        continuation of Washington and Baltimore as transatlantic co-terminals was
                        unwarranted and eliminated them.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Department’s Views.</hi> When the case was under review the
                            <gloss target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss> adopted some recommendations made by
                        the Department. These included recommendations that: certificates be issued
                        to the carriers on a temporary basis; the competitive positions of <gloss
                            target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss> and PanAm be more nearly equalized by
                        according <gloss target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss> permanent points of service;
                        the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> be maintained in the Near East; and
                        certificates include service to satellite areas despite our inability to
                        serve those areas at this time.</p>
                    <p>Although the Department considered the Board’s decision in general a
                        satisfactory solution of the complex issues involved in the case, it
                        recommended certain changes to the Bureau of the Budget prior to submission
                        of the decision to President Truman for approval. These recommendations were
                        over-ridden, however. Among other things, we felt that a period of from
                        three to five years would be more satisfactory than seven for the duration
                        of the certificates, believing the experience gained during the next three
                        to five years added to that obtained since the decision of the North
                        Atlantic Route Transfer Case in 1950 should provide an adequate basis for
                        evaluating the performance of the two US carriers. We felt that other
                        countries might be less restrictive toward the activities of our carriers if
                        they were made aware of the fact that the routes were subject to continuing
                        review and possible change.</p>
                    <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0431"/>
                    <p>Also, we urged against statements in the Board’s opinion indicating that US
                        carriers rely heavily on the carriage of traffic between the territories of
                        other states along international trunk routes (fifth freedom traffic),
                        particularly where such traffic would be gained as a result of substantial
                        deviation from a reasonably direct route. We particularly wanted to avoid
                        this situation with respect to awarding PanAm service to Lisbon and
                        Casablanca on the South Atlantic route because of the possibility of its
                        bringing about complex aviation negotiations with France and Portugal. We
                        would have much preferred in these instances that short-term exemption
                        orders be issued.</p>

                    <p>The policies established in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 15/3 have
                        been, on the whole, effectively implemented. Soviet and Satellite civil
                        aviation has been contained to the extent considered necessary to provide
                        the desired “balance of advantage.” Although the Polish airline, LOT, is
                        permitted to operate to Brussels, Paris, Copenhagen and Stockholm; we obtain
                        an advantage through the British courier air service to Warsaw. The Russian
                        airline, Aeroflot, serves Helsinki at which location containment would be
                        difficult, if not impossible, to enforce. However, several of the Western
                        Powers also have agreements to operate into Helsinki; and, in fact, Pan
                        American World Airways includes it as a regularly scheduled stop.</p>
                    <p>The Czech airline, CSA, has provided an essentially different problem in the
                        implementation of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 15/3. Before the 1948
                        Communist coup in Czechoslovakia, this airline had extensive services
                        throughout Europe; and in turn, the Czechs maintained a liberal policy in
                        granting operating rights for airlines of the Western <pb n="406"
                            xml:id="pg_406" facs="0432"/>Powers. Therefore, at the time of the
                        containment decision, Praha had become the hub of Western airline
                        penetration of the Iron Curtain and the operating rights of CSA throughout
                        Europe were firmly established. As a result, the curtailment of CSA
                        operations proceeded at a slow pace with every attention being given to
                        maintaining western air connections to Praha. Restrictions on operators and
                        passengers into Praha nevertheless made the service uneconomical; and Pan
                        American World Airways, the United States certificated carrier, finally
                        received in the fall of 1950 government approval to suspend service on this
                        route. As a result of a foreign policy decision in 1951 to exert pressure on
                        the Czechoslovak Government in various ways because of its action against
                        American interests steps were taken in cooperation with Western European
                        states to curb CSA operations through denial of permission for flights over
                        the territory of the German Federal Republic. As a result CSA now operates
                        only to Copenhagen, Stockholm and Helsinki. Recently resumption of operating
                        rights to Brussels and Paris by a circuitous route through Copenhagen have
                        been strenuously sought by the Czech Government but so far they have been
                        successfully denied. Although, as one of their reprisals to our pressure
                        measures, the Czechs have evicted from Praha the Pan Am sales office, the
                        last vestige of United States airline activity, they have strangely, and to
                        our advantage, permitted Western European airlines to continue their Praha
                        operations.</p>
                    <p>Yugoslavia was exempted from the provisions of the containment policy by
                        Presidential approval on August 16, 1949. No efforts have been made to
                        restrict the operation of its national airline, JAT, which connects Belgrade
                        with Munich, Salzburg, Frankfort, Athens, and Paris. The Swiss and Greek
                        airlines have landing rights in Belgrade and it is not believed any great
                        difficulty would be encountered if an American airline were to apply for
                        this service. In fact, a Bilateral Air Transport Agreement exists between
                        Yugoslavia and the United States and close coordination is maintained
                        between the respective aviation authorities. On the other hand, the Yugoslav
                        Government exercises some control over the services to Tirana of the Russian
                        airline, Aeroflot, by requiring a technical stop at Belgrade.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the implementation of the policy in the Near East, South Asia
                        and Africa, it has been determined that reciprocal landing rights would not
                        offer a balance of advantage to the non-Communist countries; and civil air
                        operations into these areas by the U.S.S.R. and its satellites have been
                        successfully blocked.</p>
                    <p>Implementation of the policy objectives with respect to the availability of
                        facilities and services and of aircraft and spare parts has likewise been
                        effective. Cooperation of the Western Powers has <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407"
                            facs="0433"/>been obtained and it is believed that there is a minimum
                        leakage of aviation materials through to the Iron Curtain countries. This
                        situation has been considerably strengthened by United States shortages in
                        these materials and by increased United States vigilance over their end-use,
                        which have, in part, been brought about by the Korean emergency and domestic
                        mobilization.</p>
                    <p>The policies of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 15/3 appear to have been
                        implemented satisfactorily and the balance of advantage remains in favor of
                        the Western Powers. Because of the criteria by which the necessity for
                        action is to be assessed, the objectives have a desirable flexibility and
                        unless unforeseen circumstances recommend amendment, the paper does not
                        require revision.</p>

                        effect of helping to contain the operations of CSA. However, the Department
                        understands that weekly representations are being made by the Czechs for
                        approval of CSA operations into Belgium and the Netherlands. This has so far
                        been denied although the Belgian Government has expressed concern over
                        possible retaliatory measures that may be taken by the Czechs against the
                        operations of Sabena, the Belgian Air Line, into Prague. In these

                    <p>The strategic importance of the Near and Middle East, in relation to the
                        world situation, and the nature of the political, economic and psychological
                        structure of society in this area are such that a more clearly defined and
                        aggressive policy toward these three problems appears desirable in the
                        furtherance of general American foreign policy objectives.</p>
                    <p>A basic United States policy objective toward the Near and Middle East is to
                        orient the peoples and governments of the area in the direction of the
                        United States and our Western allies in view of (1) the oil resources of the
                        area, (2) the strategic location of the area in terms of world shipping and
                        air transport routes, (3) military requirements for base rights. Various
                        tools of foreign policy have been chosen to accomplish this objective,
                        including governmental economic and military aid programs, and support of
                        private American educational, religious and commercial activities. The
                        development of U.S. national interest air routes as well as the assistance

                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Associated Airline Contracts</hi></p>
                    <p>The assistance rendered by American aviation interests in establishing and
                        operating important elements of the regional air transport system through
                        associated airline contracts has contributed substantially toward the
                        achievement of the above basic objective. Following World War II, it became
                        possible for the advances made in aeronautics to be applied to the solution
                        of the transport problem of this area where surface means of transport were
                        either nonexistent or inadequate. This was possible because of the
                        development of transport aircraft during the war, the wartime construction
                        of ground facilities, and the availability of surplus transport type
                        aircraft at very low cost from United States sources. Of all the powers, the
                        United States thus was in the best position to assist the countries of this
                        area in the establishment of regional and local air services adequate to
                        their needs and in so doing to promote American political, economic, and
                        strategic objectives in the area. The negotiation of management contracts
                        and/or partnerships between American carriers and Iranian Airways, Saudi
                        Arabian Airlines, Ethiopian Airlines, Greek National Airlines, Syrian
                        Airlines, and Middle East Airlines are examples of what was and has been
                        done in this direction. The commercial interests of the air carriers in the
                        development of feeder lines and the creation of a friendly political
                        atmosphere in the states through which certificated trunk routes were to be
                        operated were motivating factors insofar as the American companies were
                        concerned. This farsighted policy on the part of the U.S. Government and the
                        air carriers, (despite reverses in Iran and Syria which led to withdrawal of
                        the American companies) resulted in placing American aviation interests in a
                        predominant position in Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, and Lebanon. In these three
                        states, the associated airline contract constitutes one of the most
                        important tangible evidences of American activity and interest in the
                        country. In all three countries in varying degrees the technical and/or
                        management assistance rendered through private channels is of the utmost
                        importance in the maintenance of the air transport system. In Saudi Arabia
                        and Ethiopia the airline provides virtually the only means of tying the
                        country together and is therefore essential to economic and political
                        stability. These contracts provide the means for a continuing program of
                        technical and management assistance through non-governmental channels to a
                        vital public service at a minimum cost to both the United States and the
                        country concerned. As such, these contracts demonstrate what can be done
                        through private investment channels in the furtherance of our objective of
                        helping the foreign country to improve its economy. The associated airline
                        contract also provides a means <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0436"/>for
                        establishing the type of relationship between the United States and foreign
                        countries which affords the best long range opportunity for building a
                        better understanding of Americans, American techniques and the American way
                        of life. Furthermore, the dependence of a foreign government upon American
                        assistance of this type for the maintenance of a vital segment of the
                        economy of the country encourages the orientation of the government of that
                        country toward the United States. Contrary to programs of assistance through
                        government channels, the development of increased relationships on a private
                        level provides a more normal and permanent basis for close relations with
                        the United States.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, the military advantages of foreign airline associated contracts are
                        believed important, including the opportunity provided for intelligence, the
                        availability of airlift under American control, and the building up of a
                        corps of trained American personnel familiar with local conditions, and
                        skilled in flying under the unique conditions of this area.</p>
                    <p>If it be assumed, therefore, that the associated airline contract can in many
                        cases further U.S. national interests, two questions arise:</p>
                    <p>First, whether the American carrier should be required to defray the costs
                        arising from a contract of this kind which are not defensible for purely
                        commercial reasons. For example, <gloss target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss> has
                        clearly indicated that its connection with EAL would be terminated forthwith
                        were it not for considerations of U.S. foreign policy. How long these
                        broader objectives of national interest can be protected in the face of a
                        situation which places an increasing financial burden upon <gloss
                            target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss> is doubtful. If the American carrier is to
                        serve as an instrument of national policy in such cases, it would appear
                        reasonable that the U.S. Government should be prepared to bear costs which
                        can properly be ascribed to the public interest.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, if currently effective associated airline contracts in this area
                        have served the U.S. national interest, a question arises as to whether in
                        certain specific cases it would not be wise to encourage additional
                        arrangements of this type by joint effort of government and industry, under
                        a plan whereby the government would undertake, as suggested above, to
                        compensate the carrier for losses incurred in the public interest, such as
                        advances to cover unpaid debts, losses due to inconvertibility of funds paid
                        the managing carrier in local currencies, etc. Three potential opportunities
                        for associated contracts with foreign carriers in this area which would
                        appear to be commercially unattractive but in the best interests of the
                        United States are; Iranian Airways, Air Jordan, and MISR Airlines.</p>
                    <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0437"/>
                    <p>With respect to Iranian, the Embassy at Tehran has already analysed the
                        factors of U.S. national interest involved in keeping the national airline
                        in operation with Western rather than Soviet assistance, and has indicated
                        the requirements of Iranian Airways for equipment and personnel. Failure to
                        maintain Iranian Airways services through outside help from non-Soviet
                        sources might well provide unfriendly elements in Iran with the opportunity
                        for seeking Soviet aid. A first step toward Soviet penetration of Iran could
                        well be an attempt to place the air transport system under Communist
                        control. It would not be the first time that foreign subversion of a state
                        began by attempts to control the transport system. The U.S. Government fully
                        recognized the danger in South America shortly after the outbreak of World
                        War II and conducted an aggressive program to combat German infiltration of
                        Latin American aviation.</p>
                    <p>With respect to Jordan, Air Jordan in association with Trans-ocean represents
                        the sole American business venture in the country, is understood to be in a
                        very shaky financial position, and is under pressure by British interests
                        who probably wish to exclude this type of American influence from the
                        country. Transocean does not now appear to be in a position to provide the
                        financial backing to place Air Jordan on its feet in order that the
                        operation may be conducted in accordance with accepted airline practices. In
                        view of this situation it is possible that insufficient support by the
                        American associate may bring about a condition which will reflect
                        unfavorably rather than creditably upon American aviation generally and may
                        adversely affect the climate for additional American investment.</p>
                    <p>With respect to MISR, the Embassy at Cairo is of the opinion that the
                        negotiation of a management contract with an American carrier (logically
                            <gloss target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss>) would advance U.S. objectives in
                        Egypt. The Embassy therefore is hopeful that some form of contract will be
                        entered into. In all probability an examination by <gloss target="#t_TWA1"
                            >TWA</gloss> of the factors involved in concluding a management contract
                        will reveal at least two problems to be overcome; namely, (1) conversion of
                        earnings under the contract, and (2) the requirement of MISR for a
                        substantial increase in capital for the purchase of new equipment. Whether
                            <gloss target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss> will be in a position to invest
                        large sums in MISR and whether such investment would be viewed
                        sympathetically by the Civil Aeronautics Board are questions which would
                        require study. Prior to the time when the above probable obstacles in the
                        path of the conclusion of a contract between an American company and MISR
                        lead the American interests involved to react negatively to a specific MISR
                        proposal, it would seem that avenues of U.S. <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412"

                        regional carriers of this area in obtaining modern aircraft to replace
                        equipment becoming obsolescent are closely related. Factors of U.S. public
                        interest in the continued use of American aircraft by foreign carriers in
                        this area have been outlined in Beirut despatch No. 473 of February 17<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d129fn2">Not printed. (483A.119/2–1753)</note> and are
                        believed applicable elsewhere in the Near and Middle East. Present trends
                        toward increasing incursions into the U.S. aircraft export market in this
                        area indicate the desirability of a study by the Department and other
                        interested agencies of steps which might be taken to encourage the purchase
                        of American equipment by foreign carriers. While it is true that extending
                        governmental aid to promote the sale of American aviation products in
                        competition with British manufacturers raises a policy question of the
                        extent of U.S. interest in the British economy, it is felt that the issues
                        involved should be considered in all aspects including the apparent
                        political purposes behind current British efforts to sell British equipment
                        to airlines in this area, as well as the political and strategic interests
                        of the U.S. in the Near and Middle East.</p>

                    <p>If American equipment is to remain predominant in this area, a way must be
                        found to offer the Convair 340 or similar aircraft at prices and on terms
                        competitive with the Viscount. This might be done by offering longer term
                        and more liberal loans to the prospective purchaser or seller. The
                        availability of this type of assistance should, however, be reasonably
                        certain in advance in order that the seller may be in a position to quote
                        accordingly. Secondly, manufacturers should be encouraged to be more
                        aggressive in their sales efforts once governmental support is assured.
                        Numerous aviation officials in this area have expressed the opinion, for
                        example, that Convair appears somewhat less interested than Vickers in
                        selling its aircraft. Thirdly, in cases where the U.S. national interest
                        would clearly be served thereby, means should be at hand, if feasible, for
                        placing priority on the delivery of aircraft to selected foreign customers.
                        As pointed out in a recent despatch from London, British European Airways
                        has released to foreign purchasers aircraft on order scheduled for early
                        deliveries to BEA. Fourthly, an effort should be made to educate the public
                        away from technically unsound beliefs concerning the lesser safety of two as
                        opposed to four engined aircraft. A statistical analysis of accident rates
                        per miles flown by four and two engined aircraft might be useful in this
                        connection. Lastly, and perhaps in some respects most important, the
                        desirability of developing an economical and less expensive replacement for
                        the DC–3 should again be reviewed, bearing in mind that time is a real
                        factor insofar as putting such an airplane in use in this area is
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p>It is generally conceded that there may be too many airlines in this area.
                        Those who obtain modern equipment first will be most likely to survive the
                        coming financial storms and remain in business on a reasonably sound
                        economic basis. If the United States has reason to be concerned that the
                        airlines associated with American interests continue to develop and to
                        provide the major share of the airlift in this area, ways should be explored
                        to assist in overcoming the difficulties outlined above.</p>
                    <p>At the present time, it is believed important to concentrate upon the
                        provision of new aircraft to BEA and MISR Air in particular.</p>
                    <p>The promotion of a reasonably sound air transport system in the Near and
                        Middle East is important not only to American national interests in the
                        direct sense. The economy of the area depends in large measure upon this air
                        transport system. At a time when U.S. efforts are directed toward economic
                        development of the area, assistance toward the purchase of more modern
                        airline equipment would be an important factor toward a strengthening of the
                        transport system of the region. Unless the existing airline fleets of the
                        stronger regional carriers can be modernized, it is unlikely that the <pb
                            n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0440"/>air transport system can
                        indefinitely meet the needs of the economy of the region or continue to
                        stimulate economic growth. A program of loan or grant assistance for the
                        purchase of new equipment by carriers serving this area therefore appears a
                        desirable part of an economic development program. Such assistance, while
                        relatively unique as concerns the Near and Middle East would not be new,
                        witness grant aid programs to France and Italy under <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                            >ECA</gloss> for the purchase of modern four engined equipment to
                        rehabilitate the international air transport systems of those countries.
                        Furthermore, an aid program to Near and Middle Eastern carriers such as
                        suggested would not involve providing them with equipment competitive with
                        U.S. subsidized airlines and would be consistent with our policy of
                        encouraging export markets for United States aircraft manufacturers in the
                        interest of minimizing the impact upon this vital industry of a decline in
                        military purchases.</p>

                    <p>The need for improvement of ground aids to air transport in this area has
                        been recognized by airline operators, by <gloss target="#t_ICAO1"
                            >ICAO</gloss>, and by United States technicians. Progress toward
                        rectification of some of the most glaring deficiencies is being made slowly
                        by the governments concerned both with and without U.S. assistance. An
                        expanded program of technical and financial aid from fiscal 1954
                        appropriations for economic and military aid to this area is needed and it
                        is hoped will be recommended during the course of the next few months as
                        area requirements can be more clearly defined by personnel now in the field.
                        Agreements covering the installation of <gloss target="#t_VOR1">VOR</gloss>
                        equipment at Beirut have virtually been completed and similar agreements are
                        under discussion with respect to Saudi Arabia and Egypt. It is hoped that
                        funds can be obligated for equipment in these two countries prior to July
                        1953. A recommendation from Washington to the <gloss target="#t_TCA1"
                            >TCA</gloss> Country Directors to the effect that every effort be made
                        to obligate funds for this purpose within current fiscal 1953 programs would
                        be helpful.</p>
                    <p>The need for, as well as the use of, improved aids is regional in scope.
                        Allocation of funds on a country by country program basis therefore appears
                        somewhat unrealistic. A more logical approach might be to earmark sufficient
                        funds from overall aid program funds for the Near and Middle East to permit
                        allocation of monies to country program funds as specific projects are
                        developed and approved. The objective of bringing about improvement of
                        ground aids which are used regionally and benefit the area as a whole would
                        thus be assured without regard to country program planning. In some cases, a
                        facility may be required for use by foreign <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415"
                            facs="0441"/>carriers operating into a given airport or along a route
                        where only an indirect benefit to the state in whose territory the facility
                        is located can be seen. In cases of this kind, <gloss target="#t_TCA1"
                            >TCA</gloss> may be reluctant to provide, from country program funds, an
                        allocation to cover the cost of installing the equipment. It is suggested
                        that an administrative decision in Washington to place the carrying out of
                        the program under discussion on a regional basis is desirable.</p>
                    <p>Given the attitude of suspicion which exists on the part of many Near Eastern
                        States concerning motives behind U.S. Government administered programs of
                        aid, the desirability of channeling assistance toward the development of
                        ground facilities through U.S. airline organizations to the extent feasible
                        might be considered. In this way the air carrier, under contract to the U.S.
                        Government, would undertake to provide the equipment and the necessary
                        installation and training.</p>

                    <p>In August, 1951, a secret agreement was signed by Mr. Lovett and Mr.
                            Sawyer<note n="3" xml:id="d130fn3">Charles Sawyer, Secretary of
                            Commerce, and Robert A. Lovett, Secretary of Defense, during the Truman
                            Administration.</note> which assured Defense that in a period of
                        emergency the National Shipping Authority would allocate a bloc of normal
                        cargo-type merchant vessels to the Navy for its exclusive use.<note n="*"
                            xml:id="d130fn-sym9">This agreement also guaranteed to transfer to
                            Defense jurisdiction a number of merchant-type ships (includes <hi

                            as well as cargo-type vessels) which would be converted or especially
                            adapted to specialized military purposes. This aspect of the agreement
                            is not an issue between the two agencies nor is it in conflict with our
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitments. [Footnote in the
                            source text.]</note> This agreement was made without this Department’s
                        knowledge and was in conflict with the principle of a single pool of
                        civilian authority controlled <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> war-time
                        merchant shipping agreed to by the North Atlantic Planning Board for Ocean
                        Shipping (<gloss target="#t_PBOS1">PBOS</gloss>) and concurred by the
                        Council Deputies in January, 1951. At the last <gloss target="#t_PBOS1"
                            >PBOS</gloss> meeting (May, 1952) we were obliged to indicate that some
                        U.S. shipping would not be available to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> pool. This reservation resulted in considerable dismay in
                            <gloss target="#t_PBOS1">PBOS</gloss> as well as in the North Atlantic
                        Council itself.</p>
                    <p>A few weeks ago Commerce reopened with Defense the question of the control of
                        U.S. cargo merchant shipping in wartime stating their view that it is not
                        desirable for a large claimant on cargo merchant shipping in wartime to
                        control exclusively a percentage of that resource: The Department of Defense
                        in reply has indicated it stands firmly on the earlier Commerce–Defense
                        agreement and will insist on having a bloc of unconverted cargo-type
                        shipping under its exclusive jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>This development permits the Department to stress the desirability of

                                    >PBOS</gloss>) and U.S. Policy in That Organization</hi></p>
                        <p>In June, 1950, the North Atlantic Council created the North Atlantic
                            Planning Board for Ocean Shipping (<gloss target="#t_PBOS1"
                            >PBOS</gloss>). <gloss target="#t_PBOS1">PBOS</gloss>’s terms of
                            reference required it to recommend to the Council principles for wartime
                            control and allocation of member government merchant shipping.</p>
                        <p>In November, 1950, <gloss target="#t_PBOS1">PBOS</gloss> agreed to the
                            principles for the control of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            merchant shipping in wartime including the form of an organization to
                            exercise this control. In brief, these principles state that all member
                            government merchant shipping at the outset of war will be taken over by
                            these governments and placed in a single <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> pool of shipping. The control and allocation of
                            shipping from this pool is to be made by an organization to be called
                            the Defense Shipping Authority (<gloss target="#t_DSA1">DSA</gloss>).
                            The <gloss target="#t_DSA1">DSA</gloss> is to be a service organization,
                            not in itself a claimant for shipping. Its task is to meet the shipping
                            requirements of both the military and essential civilian war claimant
                            bodies. As a service organization the <gloss target="#t_DSA1"
                                >DSA</gloss> will not determine major priorities—the latter are
                            assumed to be the responsibility <pb n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0444"
                            />of the higher authority of the war. Although the <gloss
                                target="#t_DSA1">DSA</gloss> will be an international body, as a
                            practical matter the real control will rest with the National Shipping
                            Authority in Washington and the Ministry of Transport in London. The
                            executive function of the <gloss target="#t_DSA1">DSA</gloss> rests with
                            a small executive board functioning in two branches—to be chaired by the
                            U.S. and the U.K. respectively. In other words, the United States will
                            have absolute control over its own contribution to the pool and at the
                            same time have available to it the shipping resources of all our <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners. In brief, the rationale
                            behind these principles is the conviction that it permits more effective
                            and economical employment of a deficit critical resource, for that
                            resource to be controlled by an organization thoroughly qualified
                            technically to do so, but not having any claimant requirements in
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. concurred in the above principles in <gloss target="#t_PBOS1"
                                >PBOS</gloss> in November, 1950, and later again in the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council Deputies in January, 1951.
                            This position at that time had the concurrence of both the Departments
                            of Defense and Commerce. In August, 1951, the Departments of Defense and
                            Commerce without this Department’s knowledge entered into a domestic
                            agreement in conflict with our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            commitments. This agreement assured Defense that in a period of
                            emergency the National Shipping Authority would transfer to Defense a
                            sizable bloc of merchant-type ships which would be under the exclusive
                            jurisdiction of the Department of Defense. There are two categories of
                            shipping involved in this agreement—one of which is not an issue in the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nor between Commerce and
                            Defense now. This category includes all merchant-type vessels to be
                            converted to naval auxiliaries, e.g., tankers, submarine tenders, <hi
                                rend="italic">troop ships,</hi> hospital ships, especially adapted
                            cargo ships for specialized military purposes, such as the carriage of
                            ammunition, beach landings, etc. The second category includes a number
                            of unconverted, civilian crewed, cargo vessels for the carriage of
                            normal-type military requirements. It is the latter group which is the
                            issue.</p>
                        <p>Despite the embarrassment it would cause this government in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, the Department had to agree with
                            Defense and Commerce that a reservation to our earlier <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> undertaking was required. The
                            Department’s view at the time was predicated on the agreement of the two
                            agencies primarily concerned that it was to be national policy in
                            wartime for Defense to have under its control in wartime a bloc of
                            normal-type cargo shipping. Therefore, a U.S. reservation was made at
                            the last <gloss target="#t_PBOS1">PBOS</gloss> meeting (May, 1952). It
                            caused much dissension and the U.S. was requested to review its stand.
                            Subsequently, the same concern was expressed in the North Atlantic
                            Council.</p>
                        <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0445"/>
                        <p>Since the last <gloss target="#t_PBOS1">PBOS</gloss> meeting the
                            Department has been attempting to find the most palatable method of
                            presenting the U.S. position and an agreement for such a presentation
                            was reached in August between Commerce, Defense, and State. A few weeks
                            ago, however, Mr. Rothschild,<note n="5" xml:id="d130fn5">Louis S.
                                Rothschild.</note> the new Maritime Administrator, and Mr.
                                Murray,<note n="6" xml:id="d130fn6">Robert B. Murray.</note> the
                            Under Secretary of Commerce, informed the Department they no longer
                            agreed to the proposed presentation on the grounds that Commerce itself
                            was no longer in agreement with Defense that the latter should have a
                            bloc of normal cargo-type shipping under its exclusive jurisdiction in
                            wartime. This development, of course, completely alters the premises
                            under which the Department had been acting, i.e., agreement between
                            Defense and Commerce. It affords for the first time since 1951 an
                            opportunity for the Department to assist in the correction of a serious
                            U.S. embarrassment in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>

                        Board. At such time as the President requests the views of the Department on
                        this case, these conclusions will be re-examined and appropriate
                        recommendations prepared.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the routes to be served and the certificates to be issued as a
                        result of the Trans-Pacific Certificate Renewal Case, the Department
                        believes it necessary to consider anew the basic issues of whether
                        competition between the United States carriers on international routes
                        should be on the basis of direct competition between points served or should
                        be on the basis of “area competition.” In this regard it will be recalled
                        that in the Department’s <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0446"/>letters of

                        Atlantic Route Review Case strong support was given the concept of area
                        competition. Although the geographic factors involved in the Trans-Pacific
                        Case differ from those involved in the North Atlantic Case, the Department
                        believes that its previously expressed views are generally applicable in
                        this instance as well as in the North Atlantic Case and considers that the
                        principle of area competition should be applied insofar as the geographic
                        and economic conditions permit.</p>
                    <p>Consideration is also given to the fact that countries in this area are in
                        many instances developing air transport services for which they feel that
                        protection from competition is necessary. When the competition to which they
                        are subjected includes that of more than one strong United States carrier,
                        the fear of competition is multiplied, in some cases out of proportion to
                        the actual or potential effect of the operations performed by United States
                        carriers. The Department believes therefore that the continuation of area
                        competition will more successfully protect United States operating rights
                        and thus better serve the national interest.</p>
                    <p>The applications of United States carriers in this case request certification
                        for operations affecting India, which is a particularly sensitive area at
                        this time. As is well known to the Board, the Government of India and the
                        Government of the United States have recently held extended consultations in
                        which the Government of India strongly urged the drastic reduction of
                        capacity of United States carriers operating into and through India. The
                        negotiations have now been adjourned without any curtailment of current
                        United States carrier operations into India, but the situation remains in
                        very delicate balance.</p>
                    <p>The Department understands that the Board, in addition to its examination of
                        the certification of routes which are presently operated by United States
                        carriers in the Far East, also will give its attention to the linking up of
                        Trans World Airlines and Northwest Airlines, thereby creating a second
                        round-the-world service by United States carriers. The Department, after
                        consideration of the foreign relations problems in this field and in view of
                        the objective of maintaining conditions which will enable the United States
                        to sustain an adequate level of air service in the Far East, free of local
                        restrictions, does not believe that a second round-the-world service should
                        be created at this time. The area in which it would be necessary to seek air
                        rights to implement such a service is one which generates comparatively
                        little traffic, and is one which is already <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421"
                            facs="0447"/>being served by the major trunk operators of the world.
                        Under these circumstances, the introduction of an additional United States
                        carrier would be cause for general resentment compounding the difficulties
                        of obtaining the air rights needed to conduct the services.</p>
                    <p>However, should it be deemed advisable for economic or military reasons to
                        provide this second service, the manner in which this second service would
                        be accomplished is of considerable importance to United States aviation
                        relations with several foreign countries. First, in view of the extremely
                        delicate state of United States-Indian aviation relations described in a
                        foregoing paragraph, it would be deemed most unwise for the junction to be
                        made in India. In addition, it is believed that the certification of either
                        Trans World Airlines or Northwest Airlines, which would provide a second
                        United States flag service through India on route 2(a) of the Annex to the
                        United States–India Air Transport Agreement, would be of such concern to
                        India that there would be serious danger of the bilateral agreement being
                        denounced by India. On the other hand, it is thought that the use of route
                        2(b) of the Annex to the Agreement, providing for a junction point outside
                        of India, although disturbing to the Indians, would lessen the possibility
                        of such action. East of Ceylon a second service would also encounter air
                        rights problems, although not of the same magnitude as is the case with
                        India. Certification of service between Ceylon and Singapore would make it
                        necessary to conclude arrangements with the United Kingdom, as such a route
                        is not provided for in the Annex to the Bermuda Agreement. In so doing, it
                        is likely that a <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> would be required. If
                        it should be decided to take advantage of route 2(b) in the Indian
                        Agreement, it is assumed that consideration would be given to certification
                        of service to one or more of the principal traffic points of Manila, Hong
                        Kong and Tokyo as a point or points beyond Singapore. The United
                        States–Philippine bilateral includes language which would permit service to
                        and from Manila. Nevertheless, as a practical matter, the Department would
                        anticipate a renewed demand on the part of the Philippine Government for the
                        grant of the right of Philippine Air Lines to serve Tokyo as an intermediate
                        point on its route to the United States, and unless this were granted the
                        United States should expect further aggravation of current differences with
                        the Philippines. Regarding Hong Kong, the Department believes that a <hi

                        The use of Tokyo as the junction point of <gloss target="#t_TWA1"
                            >TWA</gloss> and NWA, i.e., the certification of United States flag
                        carrier service to Tokyo as the end of an Atlantic route, would require an
                        adjustment of the United States–Japan Civil Air Transport <pb n="422"
                            xml:id="pg_422" facs="0448"/>Agreement. It is not possible to forecast
                        the difficulties involved in making such an adjustment.</p>
                    <p>The applications now before the Board in this case request certification for
                        service to points on the China Mainland. The impossibility of serving the
                        China Mainland at the present time is a matter of common knowledge.
                        Nevertheless, this Department believes that the certificates issued to
                        United States carriers should include appropriate points on the China
                        Mainland notwithstanding the fact that it may not be possible to operate to
                        them for a considerable period of time.</p>
                    <p>The Department makes a distinction between the service in the area which is
                        covered by the Trans-Pacific Certificate Renewal Case considered as a whole
                        and that portion of the area in the vicinity of the China Mainland, where
                        political conditions now permit service by the United States carriers. In
                        this more limited area, where operations are restricted to a relatively
                        narrow corridor determined by the combination of political, economic and
                        geographic considerations, there may be some justification from a foreign
                        relations standpoint, at least on a temporary basis, for expansion of
                        existing operations. It is believed that action on this case should not
                        foreclose such a possibility.</p>
                    <p>The recent cessation of hostilities in Korea may soon make possible a renewal
                        of operations by civilian carriers to Seoul. It is too early to evaluate the
                        eventual relative value of services to Seoul and Pusan. However, it is
                        believed that since Seoul is the capital, it would be desirable to provide
                        for service to that city at least.</p>
                    <p>The Department would be reluctant to see two-carrier service from the West
                        Coast to the Orient discontinued as both carriers are now well established
                        and the withdrawal of either might be considered by the Asiatic nations as
                        an indication of declining United States interest in the area. The
                        Department prefers continuance of operations over the North Pacific route
                        instead of the introduction of parallel competition by two United States
                        carriers over the central Pacific route. Although the Department does not
                        believe that the North Pacific route can be justified solely on the basis of
                        the political requirements of the United States, it assumes that the overall
                        interests support its continuance. A routing of Northwest Airlines from the
                        West Coast via Honolulu to Tokyo and Manila would make it exceedingly
                        difficult for the United States to continue to deny the Philippines access
                        to Tokyo as an intermediate point on the Philippine Air Lines route to the
                        West Coast.</p>
                    <p>The Department, bearing in mind its earlier comment concerning Korea,
                        believes that the certificates to be issued in this case should provide for
                        service to all points now being served by United <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423"
                            facs="0449"/>States airlines, including Taipei which is a point of
                        considerable importance due to conditions now existing on the China
                        Mainland.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the following points, in addition to those on the China Mainland and
                        Seoul, have been certificated but are not now served: Mandalay, Hanoi,
                        Palembang, Djakarta, Penang, Kurile Islands, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, Noumea and
                        Melbourne. The Department perceives no foreign relations requirement for
                        service to Mandalay, Hanoi, Palembang, Penang, Kurile Islands, Noumea and
                        Melbourne. It does believe that Djakarta, as the capital city of Indonesia,
                        should be retained as a certificated point. The Department has no interest
                        in certification of service to Iwo Jima but it does consider that Okinawa
                        should be included on a certificated route.</p>

                        the U.S. position that a block of U.S. merchant type shipping will not be
                        available to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> pool in wartime has
                        raised serious concern in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. This
                        concern arises because it appears that the U.S. is abrogating unilaterally
                        an undertaking to which it had earlier agreed and which was approved at
                        Ministerial level. The U.S. stand threatens not only to break up the
                        shipping pool but has raised a general doubt regarding U.S. preparedness to
                        adhere to its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> undertakings.<note n="3"

                    <p>From our standpoint this problem has been most unfortunate for our <gloss

                        unfortunate because in our view it is not necessary to make a reservation
                        from the pool in order to assure U.S. military objectives. …</p>
                    <p>The reasons Defense have given for not believing its objectives can be met

                        comments. Although never stated, we believe Defense is not so afraid to be
                        dependent on an international pool of shipping—as it is aware the U.S. will
                        control its contribution—so much as it does not wish to be entirely
                        dependent on a U.S. civilian government agency for its requirements.</p>

                        <p>Although Defense reasoning here is not entirely clear, it seems in part
                            to be based on a need for “speed” at the outset of an emergency <pb

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Livie</hi>: I am very much disturbed about
                        developments in connection with the US reservation with respect to the
                        commitment of merchant vessels to the <gloss target="#t_PBOS1"
                            >PBOS</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_DSA1">DSA</gloss> pool. Knowing that you
                        share my concern and that you have been good enough to follow the matter
                        personally, I am taking this subject up with you again.</p>
                    <p>My latest information is that the Defense Department has come up with a
                        figure of … “notional ships” in response to the Fleming request for an
                        estimate of the number of vessels it would be necessary to keep out of the
                        pool, in order to meet the Defense Department’s requirements. I am sure you
                        agree with me that this is most unsatisfactory and that a US position based
                        on such a figure would probably lead, not only to the dissolution of the
                        shipping pool, but also to a loss of confidence in US–<gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitments, which would be most
                        unfortunate, particularly at this time. I understand that you propose to
                        discuss this with Frank Nash,<note n="1" xml:id="d133fn1">Assistant
                            Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, Feb. 10,
                            1953–Feb. 28, 1954.</note> and in all probability you may have already
                        done so. Since, however, Frank has resigned, it will doubtless be necessary
                        to have further conversation with others, and I don’t want you or anyone
                        else in Washington to think that our silence on this matter during the last
                        number of weeks has meant any reduction in the importance of a satisfactory
                        solution of this issue.</p>
                    <p>This matter has not been mentioned in the Council lately. I am sure, however,
                        that this is because our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners are
                        hoping that, given a chance for a careful calm assessment of the problem,
                        without pressure from them, the US will find a solution all can accept.
                        Basically, I am quite certain that the feelings of the Council are just as
                        strong as those outlined by me in my cable sent November 19, <gloss

                            >Not printed. (740.5/12–1253)</note> To repeat, I do not recall a single
                        issue which seems to have aroused more widespread anxiety on the part of my
                        colleagues than has been exhibited as a result of the US position on this
                        matter. Although dormant, the anxiety is genuine, for reasons which have
                        previously been expressed. It will, I fear, be reflected in <pb n="427"
                            xml:id="pg_427" facs="0453"/>a serious disintegration of <gloss

                    <p>When we received <gloss target="#t_Topol1">Topol</gloss> 679, dated December
                            12,<note n="4" xml:id="d133fn4">Not printed. (740.5/12–1253)</note>

                        up with some solution which would prove generally acceptable. Such
                        information as we have received indicates that that is far from being the

                    <p>The Acting Secretary stated that at this meeting yesterday he felt that we
                        were out numbered and that our case was not too good. The military had
                        insisted that on D-Day they should have control of 25% of U.S. military
                        tonnage requirements. He stated that he had presented our case as best he
                        could but he felt that the military were probably correct; that on D-Day
                        this was a minimum requirement of supply tonnage to have under military
                        orders; that commercial shipping was not satisfactory as officer and crew
                        were not required to go into combatant waters.<note n="3" xml:id="d134fn3"
                            >At this point in the source text appears an illegible, crossed-out

                        He also stated that the <gloss target="#t_PBOS1">PBOS</gloss> planning for
                        D-Day plus 24 months was completely unrealistic, as no one could see that
                        far into the future and it should be abandoned. In reply to Mr. Bonbright’s
                        statement that this was to our advantage because it gave the British and
                        ourselves control of merchant shipping far greater than that given to us

                        in dealing with the British in shipping matters would lead them to believe
                        that the military were still right—that we had always come out on the short

                            Policy</hi></p>
                    <p>In accordance with a request from the President of last September, the US
                        Government’s basic policies related to civil aviation have been reviewed in
                        the light of our national objectives. The review, prepared by the Air
                        Coordinating Committee, was delivered to the President April 30 and is
                        expected to provide policy guidance to executive agencies in testimony
                        before the Senate Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee on Senator
                        McCarran’s redraft of the Civil Aeronautics Act, 1938, in hearings that are
                        scheduled for mid-May.</p>
                    <p>The new policy statement says that there must be a continuing expansion of
                        our air services and their supporting base to keep pace with our economic
                        growth and our responsibilities as a principal world nation. For this task,
                        the resources and initiative of private enterprise are essential. The goal
                        of federal policies at this time should be directed to the development of
                        economically healthy carriers, capable of financing with private resources
                        their own continuing growth.</p>
                    <p>The sections of the report of most concern to the Department are those
                        dealing with air transport rights, exports of aircraft and other
                        aeronautical material, movement of US mail on foreign carriers, subsidies,
                        air routes, aviation technical assistance, and relations with the
                        International Civil Aviation Organization. This article deals principally
                        with the international aspects of the policy review.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">International Aviation Agreements.</hi> The review
                        recognizes the importance of operations abroad of US airlines for our
                        commercial needs, for postal service, and for our national defense. In
                        general, it endorses the policies that we have been following in the
                        international aviation field. It points to the forty-five bilateral aviation
                        agreements which we have with other countries and states that the exchange
                        of air transport rights will continue to be by bilateral agreement until
                        such time as it is possible to achieve a multilateral agreement which
                        contains principles generally in accord with those of existing US bilateral
                        agreements.</p>
                    <p>The US will continue to adhere to the policy of negotiating for international
                        air rights on the basis of all five freedoms, according to the new policy
                        statement. The five freedoms are: first—right of an aircraft to fly across
                        the territory of a foreign country without landing; second—right of an
                        aircraft to land for non-traffic purposes; third—right to carry traffic from
                        country of nationality of aircraft to another country; fourth—right to carry
                        traffic from a foreign country to country of nationality of the aircraft;
                        fifth— right to carry traffic from point of origin in one foreign country to
                        point of destination in another foreign country. The US has regarded the
                        enjoyment of all these rights as essential to economic operation of
                        international routes, to the fullest development of air transport services,
                        and in the interest of the traveling public. All bilateral air transport
                        agreements negotiated by the US since the latter part of 1944 have been
                        based on the exchange of the five freedoms.</p>
                    <p>Since the conclusion of the Air Transport Agreement with the UK at Bermuda in
                        February 1946, the US has adhered to the basic principles which were
                        established in that agreement. These include standards for relating capacity
                        to traffic on an <hi rend="italic">ex post facto</hi> basis, taking into
                        consideration the public requirements for air transport service, and the
                        requirements of both trunk line operations and local or regional operations.
                        They also include certain provisions, designed as safeguards to the airlines
                        of both contracting parties, such as the declaration that capacity shall
                        bear a close relationship to traffic demands, that the airlines of both
                        countries shall have a fair and equal opportunity to operate the routes for
                        which they are designated, and that the airlines of one country shall take
                        into consideration the interests of the airlines of the other country so as
                        not to affect unduly the other’s services. The policy statement says that in
                        negotiation of agreements for the exchange of international air rights, the
                        US will continue to adhere to the Bermuda principles as the most
                        satisfactory for relating capacity to traffic. In determining the routes to
                        be included in bilateral agreements, the US <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430"
                            facs="0456"/>will continue its objective of establishing, insofar as
                        possible, an equitable exchange of economic benefits.</p>
                    <p>Essentially, the network of bilateral air transport agreements has now
                        expanded to the point at which world-wide services are possible, and the
                        conclusion of additional agreements will serve to augment and regularize the
                        system rather than to establish the basic requirements necessary to begin
                        operations. Therefore, while new agreements may be concluded from time to
                        time, it is expected that the most outstanding developments will consist in
                        their application and interpretation in relation to operations under them.
                        The US will seek interpretation and application of its agreements in a
                        manner which will accord with the over-all objectives of an effective
                        international air transport system.</p>
                    <p>The policy also states that the US should seek to arrange long-term rights
                        for use by US civil and military aircraft of foreign bases which have been
                        constructed or improved with US funds.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Fares and Rates.</hi> The International Air Transport
                        Association (IATA), an organization consisting of most of the international
                        air carriers of the world, presently serves as the primary instrument for
                        establishing and maintaining the highly complex structure of international
                        fares and rates. The new policy states that full US support should be given
                        to the IATA as the primary instrument for establishing and maintaining sound
                        fare and rate structure for international air services. However, US reliance
                        on IATA should be supplemented by governmental authority, which is currently
                        lacking, to resolve rate problems resulting from the inadequate functioning
                        or the absence of IATA machinery. Therefore, the new policy states that the
                        Civil Aeronautics Board should be empowered by Congress: a) to control the
                        fares, rates, rules, and practices of the US air carriers, applicable to
                        transportation to and from the US, to the same extent as the Board now has
                        power to act with respect to domestic air transportation; and b) to control
                        the fares, rates, rules, and practices of foreign air carriers, applicable
                        to transportation to and from the US, more effectively than is now possible
                        under the Civil Aeronautics Act.</p>

                        for continuance of cooperative efforts in fostering the development of
                        international civil aviation. Therefore, the US should continue to support
                            <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> and propose that its future
                        activities be consistent with the following objectives: a) development of
                        additional international standards, recommended practices, procedures, and
                        regional plans for facilities and services, when necessary for safe and
                        efficient international air navigation, emphasizing implementation of

                        development and implementation of <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss>’s
                        program for the facilitation of international civil aviation; c) collection
                        and distribution of information in the field of air transport economics; d)
                        adoption of conventions on needed international air law; e) administration
                        of joint support projects for international financing of essential
                        international air navigation facilities and services. However, the number
                        and duration of meetings of the <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss>
                        Council and its subordinate bodies and the workload of the organization
                        should be reduced with consequent budgetary economies.</p>
                    <p>International aviation traffic is such that national regulations and
                        procedures governing entry, transit and exit must be simplified to the
                        maximum extent consistent with national security. The US has worked with
                        other nations in the <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> to establish
                        uniform standards and recommended practices governing border crossing
                        formalities in order to expedite this traffic. The policy statement
                        reiterates continued US support of this facilitation program.</p>
                    <p>Safety and efficiency of operations over international air routes require a
                        system of aids to air navigation based on “common system” concepts. The
                        policy states that the US will, to the extent practical, continue to provide
                        in the US and its territories and areas under its control, airports,
                        facilities, and related services required to facilitate international air
                        navigation, in accordance with <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss>
                        standards and recommended practices. The US will stress the obligations of
                            <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> member nations in this regard and
                        give support to all practical efforts by other nations to provide such

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Export and Import of Aircraft and Equipment.</hi> The
                        policy points out that it is in the national interest of the US to sell
                        civil aircraft and other aeronautical equipment to purchasers in friendly
                        foreign countries. If the manufacture and supply of aircraft become critical
                        because of a shortage of materials necessitating the use of a priority
                        system, civil purchasers of aircraft and parts in friendly foreign countries
                        should receive substantially equal treatment to that accorded US civil
                        purchasers. Likewise, the export sale of available military aircraft and
                        related equipment to friendly nations is desirable and to be encouraged as
                        much as possible, consistent with military requirements and international
                        policy. Each application by a manufacturer to release his military aircraft
                        products for sale abroad must be considered on its merits and in the light
                        of the article’s importance to national security. To encourage and
                        facilitate the sale of aircraft and related equipment abroad, the <gloss
                            target="#t_EximEximbank1">Eximbank</gloss>, in appropriate cases and
                        where necessary, should continue to make loans and to guarantee loans made

                    <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0458"/>
                    <p>The policy also points out that the US favors the development of
                        international trade and proposes to keep its market open to competitive
                        foreign aircraft and equipment which meet US levels of safety as a valuable
                        and necessary corollary to a healthy, expanding market for US aeronautical
                        equipment abroad. To accomplish this objective it is believed that the
                        following measures should be taken to permit readier access by foreign
                        manufacturers to the US market for this equipment: a) expansion of the
                        program of patent arrangements and exchange of licenses between US and
                        foreign manufacturers; b) agreements for mutual recognition for import and
                        export purposes of airworthiness certificates for aeronautical equipment; c)
                        elimination or reduction to a minimum of tariff rates and avoidance of
                        unnecessarily burdensome taxation and regulations on foreign-manufactured
                        aviation equipment.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Subsidies and Routes.</hi> The policy recommends
                        termination of subsidies to the aviation transport industry in an orderly
                        manner and the merging of trunk lines into fewer systems, thereby
                        eliminating uneconomic operations. It recognizes, however, that in some
                        cases it may be necessary to continue subsidy for an indefinite period to
                        preserve a service which is essential in the national interest and which
                        cannot be provided feasibly on a non-subsidized basis. Thus, foreign
                        competition and other special factors will probably prolong the period
                        during which subsidy will be required for international air transport
                        operations. These cases must be very carefully considered, however, not only
                        to determine whether the service itself is sufficiently essential to justify
                        federal support, but also to determine whether the service can be rendered
                        by other US carriers with less or no subsidy.</p>
                    <p>Because of the distances involved and lack of adequate high speed surface
                        transportation, US territories are dependent upon air transportation for
                        rapid communication, but in many instances are unable to generate sufficient
                        traffic to support self-sufficient air transport operations. Under these
                        circumstances, too, uneconomic duplication in services must be avoided or
                        eliminated.</p>
                    <p>National interest factors require that many international routes be
                        maintained, despite subsidy requirements. The policy review points out that
                        in large part, the present international route pattern was established at a
                        time when there was relatively little experience with the economic
                        characteristics of international air service. At that time it was not
                        generally expected that foreign flag operations would provide the degree of
                        competition which has actually developed. It was therefore thought necessary
                        to certificate competitive US flag operations for the purpose of assuring
                        adequate attention to the needs of the traveling public, and development of
                        efficient and economical service. Actual financial experience <pb n="433"
                            xml:id="pg_433" facs="0459"/>of international operations has proved to
                        be considerably less favorable than was originally anticipated. In all
                        areas, competition has greatly increased and on some routes traffic has not
                        developed sufficiently to support economical frequency or load factors. As a
                        general policy, it is desirable in the public interest that competition
                        between US flag carriers be maintained in areas where traffic is
                        sufficiently dense so that competition can be economically supported.
                        However, where such is not the case, it is difficult to justify subsidy
                        expenditures in terms of the public benefits to be derived. Under the
                        present pattern of US flag international operations, no general improvement
                        in the dependence on subsidy support is anticipated in the foreseeable
                        future. In view of this fact, and the continuing increase in the
                        effectiveness of foreign competition, the policy states that it is necessary
                        at this time and continuously to review most critically the justification
                        for maintaining the present pattern of competition between US carriers on
                        international routes. Route decisions in this area should recognize the
                        necessity of avoiding or eliminating uneconomic duplication of service
                        between US carriers.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Aviation Mobilization Planning.</hi> The policy paper
                        recognizes the importance of mobilization planning on a continuing basis and
                        in sufficient detail to achieve a high level of readiness so that available
                        civil airlift capacity will be ready to augment military air transport and
                        support the war program immediately should there be an outbreak of war. It
                        also states that international mobilization planning is desirable to
                        establish coordinated principles and policies which could be applied
                        uniformly insofar as possible by allied states to their wartime civil air

                    <p>Your Committee has recently considered the existing organization of

                            <item>The Soviet Union has developed telecommunications as a positive
                                instrument of its national and international policy and uses
                                telecommunications as a key weapon in controlling its peoples and
                                for subversion and propaganda abroad. The communists are capable of
                                disrupting our present vital, long-range high-frequency radio
                                communications at any time.</item>

                                utilized its telecommunications resources in a fully effective
                                manner in its struggle with world communism. Our basic
                                telecommunications policies, which have not been significantly
                                revised in twenty years, were set down in a period when our position
                                in the world and world conditions were quite different.</item>

                                appear to ignore the importance of telecommunications in the

                                        therefore, leaves unclear the legal basis for developing

                        Department notes the types of questions that have arisen in your discussions
                        with the British authorities over the implementation of <gloss

                        clarify U.S. views. However, in order that the Embassy may be more
                        specifically informed of the Department’s position there are
                        cross-referenced below replies to the itemized questions contained in

                        operation of reciprocal services between Paris and Moscow. <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 15/3 states that reciprocal arrangements
                        should be sought “when it has been clearly determined, on an individual
                        basis, that a fully realizable balance of advantage would result from such
                        services to the United States or the non-curtain country concerned after
                        careful evaluation and weighing of the civil aviation, economic, political
                        and military security considerations involved.” Such a balance of advantage
                        may at some time exist, but no views to this effect have yet been
                        expressed.</p>
                    <p>It was determined, however, when <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 15/3 was
                        adopted that a balance of advantage to the West did exist in the aviation
                        arrangements then in effect between Czechoslovakia and certain non-curtain
                        states. Therefore these were left undisturbed at that time. Since the
                        reasons for the interim suspension of CSA operations to Western Europe have
                        now been eliminated, the Department sees no adequate reason for not
                        reverting to the <hi rend="italic">status quo ante</hi> and resuming
                        permission for the overflights. <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>

                    <p>2. It has been established that some special air service to Warsaw by a
                        Western state is extremely important. The most favorable arrangement yet
                        found possible is the RAF courier service. As the Embassy is aware, even
                        this operation has been precariously close to summary suspension, and the
                        Department has been reluctant to suggest disturbing this delicate situation
                        lest a more unsatisfactory situation would result. It is likewise apparent
                        that enforcement of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 15/3 policy is
                        far more difficult in the Scandinavian countries <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439"
                            facs="0465"/>and the satellite operations in this area cannot in all
                        instances be tied to the principles of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        15/3.</p>
                    <p>3. Sabena and KLM services to Prague provide a reliable communication across
                        the curtain and are considered to produce benefits. It was partially because
                        of the existence of alternative services that Pan American was permitted to
                        suspend its services to Prague.</p>
                    <p>4. The Department and the Department of Defense are conducting a review of
                        U.S. policy with regard to civil operation of turbine-powered aircraft.
                        Under current policy, the United States would certainly disfavor use of
                        these aircraft across the curtain, but a final answer to the Embassy’s
                        question must await completion of the policy review.</p>
                    <p>5. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 15/3 states that each situation
                        arising under this policy should be treated “on an individual basis.”
                        Therefore, the Department does not believe it is possible to set standard
                        conditions that would be acceptable in all instances. However, the United
                        States as a general principle is in favor of Western airline penetration of
                        the curtain countries if this can be accomplished without reciprocity. If
                        reciprocity is involved, then the balance of advantage must be assessed. The
                        Department therefore cannot advise the Embassy on the desirability of
                        discouraging negotiations by Western airlines for air rights in curtain
                        countries until the terms of the negotiations are known.</p>
                    <p>Since the Embassy indicates that such questions as these have been raised,
                        the Department would be interested in knowing what comments have been made
                        and in particular what the British views currently are.</p>

                    <p>The relative importance of air as compared with surface transport in this
                        area, the underdevelopment characterizing the region, and its strategic
                        location in terms of global air routes has meant that aviation problems of
                        concern to the United States fall into two <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440"
                            facs="0466"/>major categories; namely, (1) air transport development
                        within the area, and (2) problems of securing U.S. air rights in the
                        area.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Air Transport Development</hi></p>
                    <p>The air transport system is characterized by: (a) Inadequate aviation
                        facilities in terms of navigational aids, communications facilities, etc.
                        Existing facilities for the most part were constructed by military forces
                        during the last war. The governments of the area have been faced with
                        difficult problems in maintaining existing facilities and in trying to keep
                        pace with the growing requirements for modernized facilities. In their
                        efforts the local governments have been hampered by (1) inadequate Civil
                        Aviation Department staffs, both in terms of numbers and qualifications, (2)
                        inadequate budgets, and (3) inability largely for financial reasons to make
                        the long-term plans required to meet present day requirements for facility
                        development. A regional plan, backed by sufficient funds for its
                        implementation has been recommended to the Department and <gloss
                            target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>, however it has not been implemented to
                        date. A regional rather than country-by-country program seems essential.</p>
                    <p>(b) An airline system which is comprised of far too many individual carriers
                        in relation to the air traffic potential. This in turn has led to the
                        imposition of government restrictions on air operations as between the
                        various countries, which in turn creates an economic situation which
                        discourages the introduction of more modern, larger capacity aircraft to
                        replace the existing fleets of war surplus DC–3 type equipment.</p>
                    <p>(c) Air carriers which are in the main under-capitalized and without
                        sufficient financial resources to meet the cost of acquiring modern
                        aircraft.</p>
                    <p>(d) Absence of effective government regulation and an effective program of
                        inter-governmental coordination in the field of aviation policy permits
                        unregulated cut-throat competitive practices to the detriment of sound
                        economic operating practices.</p>
                    <p>(e) Management and Operational staffs are to a large extent insufficiently
                        trained to conduct an efficient, safe operation approximating Western
                        standards.</p>
                    <p>(f) The lack of an indigenous logistics base for the air transport system,
                        plus some of the other factors above mentioned, including dependence upon
                        foreign sources of supply for material, aircraft, and technical skills, has
                        meant that foreign interests are associated to a large extent with nearly
                        all of the airlines of the area. British, French, and American influence has
                        been predominant. The political and strategic importance of the area to the
                        big powers, and the relative importance of air transport in the area have at
                        times led to competitions between these powers to maintain and/or increase
                            <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0467"/>their influence in regional air
                        transport. At the present time, American interests are associated with
                        Ethiopian Airlines (<gloss target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss> management), Saudi
                        Arabian Airlines (<gloss target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss> technical operations),
                        Air Jordan (Trans-Ocean financed affiliate), Middle East Airlines (36%
                            <gloss target="#t_PAA1">PAA</gloss>), Iranian Airways (Trans-Ocean
                        management).</p>
                    <p>The British appear to have an overall plan for increasing their influence in
                        aviation in this area, probably as the result of developments in Iran and
                        Egypt. Several airlines under British control have been merged and there is
                        evidence of an all-out attempt by the British to replace <gloss
                            target="#t_PAA1">PAA</gloss> in Middle East Airlines—a move which if
                        successful would give the British a group of associated airlines circling
                        the Near East.</p>
                    <p>A beginning has been made toward a coordinated American program of assistance
                        for the development of regional air transport in this area. <gloss
                            target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> has established an Air Staff and is
                        currently engaged in efforts to work out management contracts between
                        American carriers and DHY, the Turkish carrier, increased assistance to Iran
                        Air, and a management contract with Pakistan International Airlines.
                        Discussions have also been had relative to the negotiation of a management
                        contract between <gloss target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss> and MISR Air in Egypt,
                        support for loan assistance to Ethiopian Airlines, and the establishment of
                        a regional heavy aircraft overhaul base at Beirut, together with a regional
                        aeronautical training school.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Air Rights</hi></p>
                    <p>The situation with respect to U.S. air rights in this area is relatively
                        stable and satisfactory. An air agreement with Iran is under negotiation.
                        The most difficult problem had been in Iraq, where, after eight years we
                        have not succeeded in obtaining an agreement without a prohibition on fifth
                        freedom rights between Baghdad and other points on <gloss target="#t_PAA1"
                            >PAA</gloss>’s routes. Capacity problems of a serious nature have not
                        arisen under existing agreements to date.</p>

                    <p>There is attached a draft of a report for consideration of the Committee. The
                        first six pages of the draft are essentially a condensation of the briefing
                        presented on December 13. The balance is concerned with draft statement of
                        objectives, recommended policies, <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0468"
                        />and the action programs and organization believed necessary to implement
                        the objectives and policies.</p>
                    <p>This draft represents a very broad and aggressive approach to the entire
                        problem. However, I believe that some such approach is necessary to protect
                        the national interest and further the national objectives.</p>
                    <p>The draft is based on about six weeks’ intensive study of this problem by our
                        staff, but it essentially embodies the combined experience of about
                        one-hundred years of private, military and Government experience at all
                        levels in telecommunications and directly related problems which have been
                        brought together within our staff. We submit the draft for the consideration
                        of the Committee.</p>
                    <p>As indicated, we have prepared twenty copies, but the copies to the members
                        of the Committee and one copy to the Assistant Director for
                        Telecommunications, <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>, are the only ones
                        which have been permitted outside of our staff group.</p>

                                    broad requirement that the U.S. have a comprehensive up-to-date
                                    national telecommunications policy which will be consistent with
                                        <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0469"/>the broad public

                                <item>To make sure that the Government provides effective leadership
                                    in assuring that our national telecommunications policy and
                                    programs help enable our public and private telecommunications
                                    organizations to play their proper roles in strengthening the
                                    economic, social and political bonds of those nations which
                                    share with us the desire for peace and progress.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>It was suggested also that the primary objectives of this study would not
                            require us to devote time or attention to the domestic broadcasting
                            services.</p>
                        <p>In response to these instructions, the members of the Committee have
                            examined existing telecommunications legislation, policies, practices,
                            facilities and organizations. We have drawn freely upon the many
                            studies, publications and official Government reports dealing with this
                            subject. Liaison was established with the Chairman of the Federal
                            Communications Commission, and with those agencies of the Executive
                            Branch of the Government concerned with communications, largely through
                            the Office of the Assistant Director for Telecommunications, Office of
                            Defense Mobilization.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the course of the study, the Committee and its staff have kept
                            in close touch with the Office of Defense Mobilization to the end that
                            the work of the Committee would not interfere with or impede the
                            discharge of urgent responsibilities of the Office of Defense
                            Mobilization in the field of telecommunications. The Committee had
                            before it a report by the President’s Communications Policy Board, March
                            1951, which embodied the views of the industry leaders as of that date
                            on many of the specific problems under consideration. Western Union and
                            RCA have also informed the Staff of their current views with respect to
                            these problems. The Chairman plans to meet with industry leaders to
                            obtain their current views during the week of January 10th.</p>
                        <p>The Committee has made an assessment in a general way of the importance
                            of telecommunications to the nation.</p>
                        <p>The central question is whether or not the strategic capabilities of
                            telecommunications shall be employed by and for the nation as a whole or
                            whether telecommunications is to continue as a fragmented service
                            provided by and for each separate agency of Government and for the
                            public by competing private organizations.</p>
                        <p>If telecommunications is to be provided on an agency and company basis,
                            the problems of concern to the Government are few and relatively simple.
                            They involve public regulation and international resource management of
                            the use of the radio spectrum.</p>
                        <p>The force of events and circumstances shape the answer to the question.
                            All world powers openly utilize telecommunications as a <pb n="444"
                                xml:id="pg_444" facs="0470"/>national instrument as this country
                            does its mail service. Further, telecommunications itself is an area of
                            direct conflict and a theatre of cold war because of the active and
                            latent challenge of Soviet jamming capabilities. For these two reasons
                            it will become increasingly difficult and ultimately impossible for this
                            country to continue to meet its communications needs on an agency and
                            individual (competitive) company basis.</p>
                        <p>Policy direction and support of this nations telecommunications
                            activities must be raised to the Government level if the national
                            welfare and national security are to be adequately served.</p>
                        <p>The Committee offers a statement of what it believes the broad national
                            and international telecommunications objectives of this Government
                            should be. In recommending policies, action programs and organizational
                            changes, the Committee has set forth the concepts and the mechanisms
                            which it believes can best accomplish the national objectives and lead
                            to solutions of the many particular problems. We believe that the
                            guidelines laid down by the Committee will facilitate the solution of
                            day-to-day problems, and be flexible enough to meet changing national
                            and international conditions.</p>

                                the United States</hi></p>
                        <p>The importance of communications, especially rapid communications, to
                            this nation increases as our interests, activities and responsibilities
                            are extended further and further across the face of the globe, and as
                            the speed of transport gets greater and greater. The international
                            telegraph, telephone and radio are the great universal catalysts of
                            trade and culture, but for this nation, they are even more. Upon their
                            efficiency depends whether the United States will grow in the future, as
                            Great Britain has in the past, as a center of world thought and trade,
                            and influence. Our Constitution recognized the importance of
                            communications to the thirteen original States, by providing for a
                            national postal system as a Federal monopoly and the building by the
                            Federal Government of post roads. Today, rapid electrical communications
                            are equally important to this nation as the power center of the free
                            world. The importance of telecommunications as the “voice of command”
                            for the military can hardly be overstated in the light of current
                            weapons and military technology. In the philosophical sense, many
                            mathematicians and scientists consider that modern communications theory
                            is the key concept of 20th Century science.</p>

                        <p>The Committee believes that the present U.S. situation in
                            telecommunications is generally unsatisfactory, and in particular
                            respects, is dangerously and critically so. The situation is as follows:

                                    under a concept of regulation, and its Government communications
                                    are managed on an agency basis to serve respective and

                                    telecommunications will be carried on. The U.S. position in
                                    telecommunications is in sharp contrast with its over-all

                                    the field of international telephone service, and the Soviet
                                    Union is rapidly bringing itself into a strategic and powerful
                                    position in telecommunications. Reviving interest of Germany in

                                    insecure against potential disruption from jamming action by the
                                    Soviets. This country is presently highly dependent for its
                                    civil and military communications upon radio, which can be
                                    seriously disrupted by existing Soviet jamming systems. There
                                    are, however, some cables to Europe and South America, and a new
                                    telephone cable to the United Kingdom is under

                        <p>We have found that many of the action programs necessary to implement the
                            recommended national policies cannot be initiated without legislative
                            authority of one kind or another and without basic changes in
                            organization. This is true because of the divided authority between the
                                <gloss target="#t_FCC1">FCC</gloss> and the Executive and because of
                            the basic principle in the Communications Act of 1934 requiring
                            competition between international carriers, and the achievement of the
                            public interest, convenience, and necessity merely through regulation.
                            The action programs outlined below are in some cases interlocking <pb
                                n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0477"/>and interdependent; some are
                            short range and others will necessarily extend over an indefinite period
                            of time.</p>
                        <p>Some of these action programs can be carried out by the Executive Branch
                            within present legislative authority while in the case of others for
                            which legislation is required the Executive may either take the
                            initiative in proposing legislation or may rely upon the appropriate
                            committees of the Congress to initiate legislation. It is intended that
                            these action programs will be implemented through private enterprise
                            whenever possible.</p>

                        <p>We are convinced that these objectives can not be attained nor these
                            policies implemented within existing Government organization and under
                            existing legislation. The division of authority and responsibility
                            between the Executive Branch of the Government and the Federal
                            Communications Commission is an insurmountable obstacle. We believe that
                            the activities of the Federal Communications Commission in the
                            telecommunications field other than domestic broadcasting services must
                            be carried on within the Executive Branch.</p>

                            areas, authority and responsibility must be centralized in the Executive

                            The Department of Communications would be of Cabinet rank, would break

                            a completely independent Cabinet level organization having the
                            responsibilities and authorities, in the field of telecommunications,

                        for this Department’s views on the Trans-Pacific Certificate Renewal Case
                            (<gloss target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss> Document 5031 et al.), the
                        Department sent a letter to the Board dated September 29, 1953<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d141fn2"><hi rend="italic">Ante,</hi>
                            <ref target="#pg_419">p. 419</ref>.</note> in which the various aspects
                        of the case of interest to this Department were reviewed. This letter was
                        supplemented by a letter dated May 13, 1954 and another dated November 15,
                            1954.<note n="3" xml:id="d141fn3">The letter of May 13 dealt with the
                            question of certification to points on the China mainland; the letter of
                            Nov. 15 reaffirmed the Department’s position concerning the
                            Trans-Pacific Certificate Renewal case previously expressed in the
                            Secretary’s letter to Ryan dated Sept. 29, 1953. Neither the May 13 nor
                            the Nov. 15 letter is printed.</note> In view of the lapse of time
                        during which this case has been under consideration and the developments
                        that have taken place during that period, it is believed desirable to
                        restate the Department’s comments on the case.</p>
                    <p>The Trans-Pacific Renewal Case, affecting as it does operations of United
                        States air carriers over a broad area of the world, is one in which the
                        application of the general policy of the United States Government with
                        regard to the development of international air transport service is of
                        importance. It is the general policy of this Department to favor competition
                        between U.S. carriers in international air transport services. However,
                        experience has shown that in the international field area competition is
                        preferable to route or point-to-point competition. The Department wishes to
                        reaffirm its support of this principle.</p>
                    <p>As is well known, geographic and political factors in the Pacific area have
                        made impossible the type of area competition feasible in other parts of the
                        world. Nevertheless U.S. carriers have been able to establish competitive
                        services and to experience satisfactory relations with the governments of
                        the countries served. The Department believes that such services should be
                        continued so far as such continuation is compatible with the maintenance of
                        a reasonably economic air transport system. Such service is a demonstration
                        of U.S. interest in and contribution to the economic development of the
                        areas served.</p>
                    <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0482"/>
                    <p>On the question of certification of any U.S. airlines to points on the China
                        Mainland, the position expressed in the Department’s letter of May 13, 1954,
                        opposing such certification, is reaffirmed.</p>
                    <p>This case also involves the question of linking Trans World Airlines with
                        Northwest Airlines by (1) renewal of the presently inoperative portion of
                        the Trans World Airlines certificate for service beyond Bombay to Calcutta
                        and Far East points and the addition of Tokyo, or (2) the extension of the
                        Northwest Airlines route beyond Tokyo to Hong Kong, Bangkok and Calcutta.
                        The Department, after weighing the value of competition between U.S.
                        carriers against foreign relations problems which would arise in seeking
                        such traffic rights, does not believe that a second round-the-world service
                        should be created at this time.</p>
                    <p>However, if it is concluded that economic or military considerations justify
                        the second round-the-world service, the Department calls the following
                        factors to the Board’s attention. Current relations with India indicate that
                        the establishment of a connecting point between Trans World Airlines and
                        Northwest Airlines in that country cannot be accomplished in the foreseeable
                        future. Although a certificate providing for a connecting point outside
                        India would be less disturbing to the Indians, difficulties would be
                        encountered in obtaining the desired traffic rights, particularly should
                        such certificates require conclusion of arrangements with the United Kingdom
                        for service to Singapore or Hong Kong. Furthermore, any additional U.S.
                        carrier service operating in direct competition with the Philippine airline
                        is likely to encounter serious resistance, especially with reference to
                        fifth freedom traffic. This is also true of new service competitive with the
                        Indian airline as long as the United States airlines enjoy traffic rights in
                        India.</p>
                    <p>Aside from operational problems a carrier’s relationships with the
                        governments and people in the area which it serves affect the reactions of
                        those governments and people to the United States as a whole. Withdrawing
                        Northwest Airlines from the places where it has developed good-will and
                        favorable relations and, in the case of Korea and Formosa, substituting a
                        new carrier, would leave at best a period of uncertainty and a need for
                        especial care in replacing the loss.</p>
                    <p>The Department brings the above foreign relations considerations to the
                        attention of the Board in accordance with its request in order that it may
                        have them available in its examination of the case. The Department is fully
                        aware, however, that these views represent only a few of many considerations
                        which the Board must take into account in determining this case.</p>

                    <p>In a letter dated December 20, 1954<note n="2" xml:id="d142fn2">Not printed.
                            (911.5200/12–2054)</note> the Bureau of the Budget in accordance with
                        the usual procedure requested the views of the Department on the Civil
                        Aeronautics Board’s recommended decision in the Trans-Pacific Certificate
                        Renewal Case (Docket 5031, et al) dated December 17, 1954. Subsequently, the
                        Department was requested by a telephoned message from the Bureau of the
                        Budget to expedite its comments on this case, sending them to the Bureau of
                        the Budget not later than December 27. Informally the Department has learned
                        that the reason for the expedited action is to enable a cabinet level
                        meeting scheduled for December 30 to discuss this case. Up to the present
                        time the Department of State has apparently not been invited to participate
                        in this meeting.</p>
                    <p>It is important that the Department of State participate in the meeting to
                        discuss the Trans-Pacific Case since it involves international civil air
                        transport matters. Furthermore, the responsibility for negotiating with any
                        foreign governments for additional traffic privileges which may be needed to
                        implement the routes authorized rests with the Department. The meeting will
                        afford an opportunity to clarify the Department’s interests and
                        responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>The Board’s decision recommended a continuance of both Pan American and
                        Northwest operations across the Pacific; the denial of <gloss
                            target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss>’s application for an extension of its
                        certificate to permit a round-the-world service through connection with
                        Northwest; and a denial of the Transocean Airlines’ application for a
                        certificate to operate across the Pacific. The Department did not make
                        previous comments with regard to the Transocean application. The Board’s
                        proposed decision with regard to other matters is in line with the
                        Department’s recommendations. There is attached a letter to the <pb n="458"

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Hughes</hi>: Reference is made to the Bureau of
                        the Budget’s letter of December 20, 1954 transmitting a copy of the Civil
                        Aeronautics Board decision in the Trans-Pacific Certificate Renewal Case,
                        Docket 5031 et al., and requesting the views of this Department thereon. The
                        Department believes in general that the views expressed by the Board are
                        consistent with and would further the foreign policy objectives of the
                        United States at this time.</p>
                    <p>It is noted that the Board’s decision provides for continued competition
                        between United States carriers across the Pacific and that it establishes,
                        so far as is possible under existing conditions in the Pacific, area
                        competition between such carriers. In this connection the Department notes
                        that the Board has found that any savings that might result, even under
                        reasonable assumptions favorable to single carrier service, would be far
                        outweighed by the overall benefits resulting from competition over the
                        Pacific. It is the Department’s view that this finding indicates that
                        continuation of competition over the Pacific is consistent with the Civil
                        Air Policy expressed <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0485"/>in the Air
                        Coordinating Committee’s report of May 1954, approved by the President.</p>
                    <p>The Board’s handling of the situation with regard to certification of
                        carriers to serve points presently inaccessible to United States air
                        carriers because of the political situation seems to this Department to be
                        especially noteworthy. The Department is pleased to note that the Board has
                        found it possible to continue a flexible situation with regard to these
                        points without naming them as points in a new certificate. In this respect
                        it is assumed that the authorization to serve these points through the
                        application of the Administrative Procedures Act is subject to further
                            <gloss target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss> approval should it become feasible
                        to operate to these points.</p>
                    <p>As is noted in the Board’s Opinion, operations into Hong Kong by Northwest
                        Airlines cannot be begun until the British have agreed that a United States
                        airline may exercise traffic rights there.</p>
                    <p>The Department also wishes to express its approval of the Board’s action in
                        deferring decision on the <gloss target="#t_TWA1">TWA</gloss> request for
                        renewal of existing authorizations to serve points in the Far East. Inasmuch
                        as this Department has found that such value as a second round-the-world
                        service at this time might provide would probably be outweighed by the
                        foreign relations problems that would arise in seeking the traffic rights
                        necessary to establish such a service, it is believed that the Board’s
                        opinion denying the application for new and additional points for that
                        purpose is wise.</p>
                    <p>In view of the above foreign policy considerations, the Department of State
                        recommends the approval of the Board’s decision in the Trans-Pacific
                        Certificate Renewal Case.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                        Committee and its subcommittees. Through this medium, and its predecessors,
                        the interested agencies have cooperatively developed policies and procedures
                        currently governing the mutual security programs. The question: What
                        committee arrangements will be needed in the future?</p>
                    <p>Although the real issue is how the committee is set up and managed, at the
                        outset some will question the need for a committee at all. The facts which
                        support the need for some committee arrangement can be simply stated. The
                        Mutual Security Program consists of diverse operations, employing diverse
                        techniques among diverse peoples and situations. Many parts of three
                        separate Government agencies are directly involved in the program. In
                        addition many aspects of the program impinge on the responsibilities of
                        several other agencies. The constituent elements of the program, however,
                        all support the same foreign policy objectives; and the sine qua non of
                        successful accomplishment is consistency in conception and execution.
                        Committee work is not the only way to develop this consistency of course.
                        But it is one of the more important ways by which we can get multi-agency
                        action, with economy in time and effort.</p>
                    <p>In establishing new committee arrangements we should take advantage of some
                        unfortunate experiences with ISAC. While there is a surfeit of uncritical
                        judgment on the errors of ISAC, there were <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461"
                            facs="0487"/>actually five aspects in which it was found wanting. To
                        begin with, too much reliance was put on formal committee action. It has
                        long since been proven true that the Government would jar to a halt if it
                        were not for the informal day-to-day contacts between individuals of
                        different agencies. Any artificial requirements that all collaboration be
                        through a committee is nonsense of course, but the relative emphasis between
                        the formal and informal is important. The greater your staff can accelerate
                        the evolution of informal cooperation, the quicker we will solve the problem
                        of “Government by committee”. A second shortcoming ISAC suffered was the
                        lack of good staff work. Too much responsibility was put on subcommittees
                        instead of on agencies. There comes a time in the development of a policy or
                        a procedure when it should move from an agency to an inter-agency forum.
                        Generally, however, the subcommittees of ISAC were formally seized with a
                        problem too early in its development. The staff work was similarly faulty in
                        that neither in the committee structure, nor in the agency structure was
                        there one group responsible on a full time basis for reviewing and seeing
                        that action was taken on the whole range of problems in the program. This
                        was a serious gap which the Gordon shop should overcome. At heart, such a
                        general review is a planning function in which the major problems are
                        separated from the minor problems. The staff responsible then takes the
                        action necessary to reach a quick solution—even though the action might be
                        to have one of the agencies do it. A third deficiency we suffered in ISAC
                        was a lack of discipline in controlling the gestation period of the various
                        problems. Many of the issues in the mutual security field require, by their
                        complex nature, considerable inter-agency exposition, discussion and
                        reflection. Decisions on these issues many times involve overruling stoutly
                        held points-of-view. The problem is to allow sufficient discussion and
                        analysis to clarify the issue and develop the facts which bear upon it, but
                        to terminate this process with a decision before discussion reaches the
                        point of diminishing returns. Our handling of the infrastructure question is
                        a good example of how it shouldn’t work. Disciplining the gestation period
                        works two ways. We can get as poor results by precipitately inflicting a
                        unilateral decision as we can by interminable discussion and analysis.
                        Fourth of the major ISAC errors was the way the subcommittees developed. In
                        the beginning, ISAC established subcommittees by speculating on the pattern
                        in which anticipated problems would arise. There is no doubt that it was
                        overdone. Moreover, membership in the parent committee carried a right to
                        membership in all subcommittees. This led to a swelling in the subcommittees
                        which was not conducive to brisk discussion. The last error in ISAC was that
                        the members were not all able to speak for their agencies. It <pb n="462"
                            xml:id="pg_462" facs="0488"/>will be essential in forming the new
                        committee that we assure members who can in fact speak for their agency
                        heads. Some of these problems will be avoided by the way we set up the
                        committees; some will be avoided by better management.</p>
                    <p>Against this background, it is recommended that initially we establish only
                        one committee, to be known as the Mutual Assistance Advisory Committee and
                        to be chaired by Mr. Gordon. It is recommended that no permanent
                        subcommittees be established but that for the time being we rely upon the
                        designation of <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> groups to consider <hi
                            rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> problems, with the membership to be determined
                        by the chairman of the parent committee. It is recommended that we continue
                        to use the secretariat facilities of the State Department. This would have
                        the advantages of maintaining a common secretariat for both <gloss
                            target="#t_MAAC1">MAAC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        problems. State’s people are experienced in the subject matter, and it is
                        administratively much more convenient.</p>
                    <p>One problem on which we have come full circle over the past year is how we
                        relate the assistance aspects of the mutual security program to U.S.
                        positions in regional groups, such as <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.
                        In the present situation, where authority is separated again, the State
                        Department could establish—in addition to the committee discussed above—a
                        committee to coordinate the agencies on those <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> matters which do not involve assistance programs. It is
                        possible that the Departments of State and Defense would prefer this, and
                        there might be some advantages to such a course. On the other hand, such a
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> committee would consist of the
                        same agencies proposed for the <gloss target="#t_MAAC1">MAAC</gloss> and the
                        agencies would be represented by the same people. Both committees would be
                        serviced by the same secretariat and many of their problems would be
                        impossible to separate. Establishing two committees at this time, therefore,
                        seems extraordinarily impractical. In lieu thereof it is recommended that
                        the <gloss target="#t_MAAC1">MAAC</gloss> also be used for coordinating
                        non-assistance U.S. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> positions, with
                        the Chair alternating between your office and the State Department depending
                        on the agenda.</p>
                    <p>There has been some discussion about whether or not in addition to a working
                        level committee there shouldn’t also be a Cabinet-level committee which you
                        would chair. From an institutional standpoint, such a committee would have
                        several disadvantages. For example, there would likely be more decisiveness
                        and discipline in the working-level committee if conflicts either had to be
                        resolved there or else the dissenting member had to carry the burden of
                        proof to get his own agency head into the matter. There is also a question
                        about the extent to which a Cabinet-level committee would restrict your
                        flexibility in resolving differences. Many such differences which occur will
                        be between two Departments <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0489"/>only.
                        Many such differences might be resolved more readily below the Cabinet
                        level, but above the working committee. As you know, we created a
                        Cabinet-level Foreign Military Assistance Steering Committee at the
                        Cabinet-level a couple of years ago. It has met once and that meeting was
                        only a formality.</p>
                    <p>On balance it is recommended that no Cabinet-level committee be established
                        at this time, although it is recognized that there might be other
                        considerations which would offset these disadvantages.<note n="3"

                    <p>Since the transmittal of the aforementioned memorandum, and as a result of
                        Presidential decisions,<note n="2" xml:id="d146fn2">At the Secretary’s Staff
                            Meeting on Feb. 26, 1952, Merchant reported that there had been a
                            meeting the previous day with the President to decide on what had to be
                            done regarding proposals for an additional $55 million for Israel and
                            additional $60 million for India and Pakistan, and Ambassador Locke’s
                            proposal to increase by $100 million the amount recommended for the
                            Middle East region. The notes of the meeting read in part as follows:
                            “The President decided that there would be no change in the ceiling of
                            the program of $7.9 billion. He approved $55 million in addition for
                            Israel, $60 million for India and Pakistan, and $5 million for the
                            Middle East requests. $50 million of the $120 million additional will
                            come from the military end-item program of $5.4 billion; $15 million
                            will come from the administrative side; and $55 million will come from
                            the elimination of a new request for <gloss target="#t_UNKRA1"
                                >UNKRA</gloss>.” It was felt that the <gloss target="#t_UNKRA1"
                                >UNKRA</gloss> program could be handled by “other means”.

                    <p>In a nationwide radio and television address on March 6, 1952, President
                        Truman urged continuation of the Mutual Security program for fiscal year
                        1953 as “essential to advance our program of world peace and to protect the
                        security of the United States.” In order to implement the program, the
                        President requested a Congressional allocation of $7.9 billion, $5,889
                        million of which would go to Europe in the form of direct military aid
                        ($4,070 million) and defense support ($1,819 million). The text of the

                        million ($615 million of which was for economic aid for Europe) as a result
                        of amendments proposed by Representative John Vorys (R.–Ohio), passed by a
                        vote of 246–109 on May 23. A Senate bill, also authorizing $6.9 billion,
                        passed May 28 by a vote of 64–10, with amendments by Senator Henry C.

                            Ambassador Cowen took over on the Mutual Security Affairs job I urged
                            him to get a complete inventory of the active problems for which he
                            would have varying degrees of responsibility. He did this and the
                            attached paper, which he gave me to read and asked me to pass to you, is
                            such an inventory. Since this covers the waterfront without going into
                            too much detail, I think it will be useful to you to look it over.
                            Ambassador Cowen says there are one or two of these subjects which he
                            would like to discuss with you after you have looked over the paper.”

                    <p>A decision to give $300 million in economic aid to the UK during the fiscal
                        year 1952 was made subject to the following conditions: 1) that the funds
                        would be used only to purchase items directly related to military uses, and
                        2) that payments would only be made against contracts yet to be signed, with
                        exceptions in specific cases, providing past shipments were not covered.
                        During the past two months British reserves have continued to decline at an
                        alarming rate. In the opinion of Embassy London, if the drain continues at
                        the current rate, the British economy may be brought to a point where the
                        entire British military effort would be threatened. It has been estimated
                        that, even under the most favorable conditions, on the present basis of
                        eligibility the actual impact of aid on British reserves before June 30,
                        1952 will fall significantly short of $160 million. According to Embassy
                        London, therefore, the full $300 million can be reflected in reserves by
                        that date only if 1) we allow reimbursement for past shipments which can be
                        fully documented <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0501"/>and 2) we extend
                        the range of eligible commodities to include some items not directly related

                        reviewed. This action is the result of the failure of South Africa to obtain
                        jet aircraft to equip the squadron. The Union Government had promised the
                        squadron jets as far back as May 1951, and inability to make good on the
                        promise has, according to the Union Government, accentuated the problem of
                        obtaining volunteers for the squadron. Our Ambassador at Capetown<note n="6"

                        in six months, the decision could be reconsidered. We have asked the
                        Department of Defense to reexamine the problem and furnish us with

                        through <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> countries. The UK recently
                        inaugurated licensing controls over the physical movement pf goods in
                        transit and urged the countries participating in export controls to adopt
                        similar controls. <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>, due largely to
                        Dutch, Belgian and French opposition, turned down this proposal. We are
                        gratified at reports of Belgian-Dutch negotiations understood to involve the
                        adoption of licensing controls over the physical movement of goods
                        transiting their countries. It is understood, however, that the Dutch are
                        imposing a condition that the UK adopt financial controls, similar to those
                        in the Netherlands, which the UK is known to oppose. If these differences
                        are resolved and the Belgians and Dutch adopt licensing controls over

                                        appears to be that we cannot and do not use the money we
                                        have received. His position on this matter will determine

                                    <item>His principal concern is that the <hi rend="italic"
                                            >scope</hi> of assistance is increasing, not decreasing.
                                        His approach is best expressed in Section 503 of the Act of
                                        1951, limiting the scope of aid after June 30, 1952. Some
                                        discussion with him on defense support for Europe, and the
                                        scope of assistance outside Europe would be advisable. He
                                        probably favors a reduction in amount.</item>

                                        It may be advisable to emphasize to the Senator that the
                                        cost of security is a first priority; it is not “can we
                                        afford it?” but “can we afford not to afford it?”</item>

                                        might center around the key arguments in support of the
                                        program, particularly why defense support is
                                        necessary.</item>

                                    <item>Reduction in amounts. Mr. Richards will, in all
                                        probability, sponsor or join in some proposal to reduce the
                                        funds, not a crippling reduction, but one he can and will
                                        defend on the floor. It will be difficult to convince him
                                        that some reduction is not possible. The full amount should
                                        be urged, without question, but not in such a way that would
                                        prevent us from supplying him with cogent arguments to
                                        support the amount finally recommended by the
                                        Committee.</item>

                                            >AMP</gloss>, and defense support should be clarified.
                                        Mr. Richards will back defense support funds as he did last
                                        year. Emphasis should be placed on viewing defense support
                                        as the assistance necessary to produce a total economic
                                        effort for defense. His speech of last year (<hi

                                        support assistance is merely “Marshall Plan giveaway” under
                                        a defense label. It will be difficult to persuade him
                                        otherwise, but the effort should be made. He is willing to
                                        support defense support items used directly for military
                                        production (<gloss target="#t_AMP1">AMP</gloss> type) but

                                        assistance in loans. Although this question has not yet
                                        arisen, it might be well to go into it with Mr.

                                        additional conditions into the legislation, particularly on
                                        European integration. He is quite concerned that Europe is
                                        not “integrating” under our urging and that it must do
                                        so.</item>

                        thought to the effectiveness with which the Department is exercising its
                        responsibility under existing legislation to assure that the various Mutual
                        Security programs conform to the objectives of American foreign policy.<note

                                471</ref>.</note> A brief review of the Department’s previous role
                        concerning the aid programs might be useful as background for the present
                        unfortunate situation. Since the programs of military assistance were first
                        established by the Congress there have been at least a half-dozen men who
                        for more or less brief periods have exercised the Department’s authority.
                        This authority has varied all the way from little more than a liaison
                        responsibility to the high point of <gloss target="#t_SISA1">S/ISA</gloss>
                        under Mr. Cabot, who was given a degree and extent of responsibility which
                        few officers in the Department have ever had. Unfortunately, Mr. Cabot
                        appears to have allowed his authority to slip from his hands into those of a
                        number of other people, with the result that the Department never exercised
                        the leadership and control with which it was charged by the Congress.
                        Following the unhappy <gloss target="#t_SISA1">S/ISA</gloss> experiment, the
                        Mutual Security Act gave coordinating and operational authority over the aid
                        programs to the Director of Mutual Security.<note n="2" xml:id="d150fn2">See
                            the memorandum by Sheppard, Oct. 27, 1951, <ref target="#pg_460">p.

                        />did, however, specifically reassert the control of the Secretary of State
                        over the conduct of foreign relations. To meet this situation, <gloss
                            target="#t_SMSA1">S/MSA</gloss> was established. As far as economic aid
                        programs are concerned, the history of the relations between the Department
                        and the <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> are too well known to call for
                        any description.</p>
                    <p>I find that at present the Department is not exercising its proper role in
                        the Mutual Security programs. This situation arises from a number of facts.
                        In effect there is no longer a staff which works with these problems, due to
                        numerous changes of leadership, personnel, and authority. Each geographical
                        bureau tends to run its own part of the aid programs without reference to
                        the other parts of the world and without any strong coordinating force from
                        above. As a result, each of the bureaus deals directly with the Director of
                        Mutual Security, <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>, Defense, and other
                        concerned agencies. Any coordination which can be taken to represent the
                        voice of the Department is purely coincidental. I do not mean to imply that
                        the bureaus are not working effectively for their own areas: for example,
                        the <gloss target="#t_RA1">RA</gloss> Office in <gloss target="#t_EUR1"
                            >EUR</gloss> is doing a superb job, but necessarily it is concerned with
                        its own regional interests rather than the global aspects of the aid
                        programs as instruments of foreign policy. I find that quite naturally an
                        outside agency might get one answer from one bureau and a second answer from
                        another. As a result the other agencies are more or less consistently
                        confused as to what the views of the Department are and they are normally
                        irritated at not being able to come to one focal point. Somewhat to my
                        surprise, I have found an amazing amount of desire in many quarters in
                        Washington for stronger leadership and more effective guidance from the
                        Department and an inability to understand why the Department does not assert
                        itself. For example, in some of the briefings which Mr. Harriman received
                        from his staff prior to his presence before the Congress, I noticed that
                        many decisions which were taken were made subject to the approval of the
                        Department. In brief, I believe that the Department leadership in the aid
                        programs can and should be reasserted but I also believe it can only be done
                        by a drastic tightening up of our own internal organization.</p>
                    <p>Two ways of accomplishing this objective occur to me. The first one would be
                        a new Departmental directive on the functions and authority in <gloss
                            target="#t_SMSA1">S/MSA</gloss> which would make it clear beyond any
                        shadow of a doubt that directive and coordinating authority for the
                        discharge of the Department’s responsibility in the aid programs resides in
                            <gloss target="#t_SMSA1">S/MSA</gloss>, that all Mutual Security matters
                        must be cleared through that office, and that the office is the point of
                        contact for other agencies with the Department. Any such directive should of
                        course be brought to the attention of the other agencies.</p>
                    <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0518"/>
                    <p>There is another solution which offers advantages in view of the previous
                        piebald record of the Department in exercising its authority on these
                        matters. This solution would be to request the Congress to write into the
                        legislation authority for the creation of a new Assistant Secretary of State
                        for Mutual Security. This position would be authorized to continue for the
                        duration of the aid programs and would automatically go out of existence
                        with their termination. The principal advantage I see to this solution is
                        that the position would carry a title and authority of long and recognized
                        status in the hierarchy. The titles which have been used for this position
                        have been either extemporaneous invention and, therefore, lacking the
                        necessary weight, or they have become so hackneyed through casual use or
                        misuse to a point where they have largely become meaningless. In my
                        experience I have noticed that conventional titles and designations have
                        generally been more effective. I am convinced that the Congress could with
                        little difficulty be persuaded to write such a provision into the
                        legislation now under consideration and I also believe that the position
                        would greatly facilitate and improve effective coordination within the
                        Department.</p>

                            substituting “general supervision” for “general direction.” We

                    <p>The Secretary met yesterday afternoon with Mr. Harriman, Mr. Draper, Mr.
                        Batt, Mr. Nash and Mr. Perkins. The Secretary told me following the meeting
                        a little of the discussion on the questions which Mr. Heneman has raised in
                        the attached memorandum.<note n="2" xml:id="d152fn2">Reference is to the

                    <p>With regard to item 1 (the question of “general direction and leadership”
                        versus “general supervision”), the Secretary said that Mr. Harriman plead
                        for the Secretary to give in on the point and agree to Mr. Harriman’s
                        wording. The Secretary said he declined to do this but agreed to think it
                        over. They mentioned that some other wording may be found which would solve
                        the problem, although to my knowledge no such wording was suggested. The
                        Secretary said he could take care of any problem arising with specific
                        individuals by instructions to them and he felt that no problem of keeping
                        them in line would necessarily arise. The Secretary has agreed to consider
                        this whole question but he is inclined to think that he is fighting a losing
                        battle and does not consider that the wording Mr. Harriman has in mind would
                        be a serious loss.</p>
                    <p>With regard to item 2 (the question of extending the proposed Executive Order
                        to include a reference to Ambassador Draper’s role), the Secretary said that
                        Mr. Harriman had withdrawn his request on this subject.</p>
                    <p>With regard to item 3 (legislative authorization for information media
                        guarantees), the Secretary said that he was a little confused about this
                        whole question and he was a little uncertain as to just what our position
                        was versus Mr. Harriman’s position. He said Mr. Harriman wanted this
                        provision in the law, with the State Department administering it. Perhaps
                        Mr. Perkins can provide more information on the discussion on this point.
                        From the Secretary’s remarks to me, I gather it was rather inconclusive.</p>

                        therefore the Secretary did not speak to him, then to Mr. Kenney. He said he
                        had told Mr. Harriman he would reconsider the wording of the executive order
                        applying to <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> operations abroad, with
                        reference to whether he would be willing to have “general supervision”

                        direction and leadership”. He said he had reviewed the matter now and felt
                        he could not change the wording which he had so strongly advocated in past
                        instances, and that he could not see any reason why it should be changed in
                        this instance.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he proposed to let the draft go to the President, asking
                        the Budget Bureau to inform the President that there had been some criticism
                        of the language as it stood, but that he, the Secretary, would not send a
                        memorandum along arguing his side of the matter.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Kenney said he thought that was all right. His concern arose because he
                        had encountered difficulties due to these two words. The Secretary said he
                        felt sure that there was no chance of difficulty arising, except in possibly
                        one or two specific cases. If it did, he would take charge and see that it
                        did not develop.</p>

                    <p>We have just learned confidentially that Senator Green proposes to introduce
                        the following amendment for insertion in this year’s Mutual Security
                        Act.</p>

                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>“The Congress believes it is essential that the Mutual Security Act be
                            administered so as to make it clear at all times that the American
                            people wish to assist dependent peoples the world over to establish
                            their own free political and economic institutions.”</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>According to our information which comes from a member of the staff of the
                        Foreign Relations Committee, no Senator can be expected to oppose this
                        amendment. In addition, strong representations by the Department to the
                        Committee, especially after the President’s recent speech,<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d155fn2">Reference is presumably to President Truman’s
                            nationwide address of Mar. 6 on the Mutual Security program. See the
                            editorial note, <ref target="#pg_470">p. 470</ref>.</note> would be both
                        difficult and embarrassing. Consequently, it seems to us that our only
                        course of action would be an informal and personal approach to Senator
                        Green.</p>
                    <p>Although the wording of the proposed amendment is fairly restrained, I think
                        you will agree that its introduction at this time, and subsequent passage,
                        would be sure to cause great concern among our Allies with overseas
                        dependencies, particularly coming on top of the President’s recent speech. I
                        strongly urge that an effort be made to talk the Senator out of it and I
                        hope, that you would be willing to take this on.</p>
                    <p>The task is made more difficult by the fact that the confidential manner in
                        which we obtained the text of the proposed amendment makes it impossible for
                        us to reveal our knowledge of its existence. We therefore have to find
                        another “peg” on which to hang the discussion. It seems to us that the peg
                        may be provided by the Secretary’s telephone conversation with Senator Green
                        on March 25.<note n="3" xml:id="d155fn3">No record of this conversation has
                            been found in Department of State files.</note> I attach a copy and you
                        will note in the second paragraph that they discussed the colonial question.
                        It seems to me that you could approach the matter by indicating that the
                        Secretary asked you to follow up on this conversation. You could perhaps
                        begin by explaining our position on the Tunisian question along the lines of
                        the Secretary’s press conference yesterday. With this as a starter, you
                        might be able to smoke the Senator out in revealing his plans so that a
                        direct discussion of his proposed amendment would follow.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, we have a very tight deadline if there is any hope of getting
                        the Senator to withdraw. According to our confidential source we must act
                        before tomorrow (Friday) evening. Otherwise it is believed we will be too
                        late.</p>
                    <p>I am also enclosing for your information a copy of a memorandum prepared by
                        Messrs. Knight and Nunley which I think has some good and interesting
                            suggestions.<note n="4" xml:id="d155fn4">A handwritten notation at the
                            end of the source text reads: “I think it important to consult with Ti

                                source text is accompanied by two covering memoranda. The first,
                                dated Apr. 17, is from Knight to Under Secretary Bruce and reads as
                                follows: “This is one of the papers which I mentioned yesterday in
                                connection with the Colonial problem. It may be difficult to use
                                after the President’s recent speech. I will forward the paper from
                                which this stems after touching it up a bit.” The second covering
                                memorandum was drafted by Knight on Mar. 26 in reaction to an
                                exchange between Senator Green and Secretary Acheson during the
                                Secretary’s testimony on behalf of the 1953 Mutual Security Program
                                on Mar. 18. A copy of this paper, along with the briefer summary

                        <p>In considering any proposal for the expression of a point of view by the
                            United States on the “colonial question”, it is important first to
                            recognize that the people of the United States have a natural sympathy
                            for the aspirations of dependent peoples for freedom, independence and
                            economic well-being. This sympathy has been demonstrated time and again
                            by the actions of the United States Government, both in dealing with
                            territories under its control and in the exercise of its influence in
                            behalf of other dependent peoples (Indonesia, India, Libya, etc.). As a
                            basic principle of its foreign policy, the United States believes that
                            the peoples of all territories now dependent should eventually attain
                            self-government, either by establishing the territory as an independent
                            state or, where acceptable to the peoples concerned, by political
                            integration with the mother country under conditions of freedom and
                            equality.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, in the application of this fundamental policy to
                            particular situations, the United States is required to take into
                            account certain additional considerations, as follows: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The United States cannot, by action or implication,
                                    automatically endorse “just any” independence movement, without
                                    regard <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0527"/>to its
                                    competence, political coloration or probable consequences. In
                                    some instances, these movements are inspired and dominated by
                                    the forces of Communist imperialism, which has long aimed at
                                    separating dependent peoples from the colonial powers as a first
                                    step in subjugating the former and breaking down the strength of
                                    the latter. In such cases, the movement is not toward
                                    “independence” at all, but in fact toward a powerful and
                                    merciless tyranny. In other instances, the movement may be
                                    genuine but may be undertaken by a people so pitifully
                                    ill-prepared for self-government that immediate success would
                                    result in increased economic weakness, social retrogression, and

                                    established on solid political, economic and social foundations.
                                    Otherwise, the dependent peoples risk exchanging a temporary
                                    political subordination for a crushing despotism which might
                                    take generations to break.</item>

                                    with mother countries as well as dependent peoples. Some of the
                                    mother countries, in fact, such as France and the United Kingdom
                                    are important allies in the world struggle against Soviet
                                    imperialism. Our security requirements will not permit us to be
                                    indifferent to any development which threatens the legitimate
                                    interests of these countries and which might gravely weaken
                                    their capacity to act as full partners in our collective
                                    security system. There would be little value in a policy
                                    designed to create strong and democratic friends 50 years hence
                                    at the cost of sacrificing the strength and stability of the
                                    nations upon which our security depends at this moment. Our aim
                                    must be to avoid a choice between these alternatives and to
                                    pursue policies through which the true interests of both mother
                                    countries and dependent peoples may best be realized.</item>

                                <item>Even without regard to the aims of United States policy, there
                                    is always a delicate question as to when, how and to what extent
                                    United States influence can be used effectively in particular
                                    circumstances. In disputes between a mother country and a
                                    dependent territory, intervention by a third party may often
                                    serve no purpose other than to create suspicion on both sides,
                                    and sometimes produce a result quite the reverse of what was
                                    intended. Moreover, the use of United States influence places on
                                    us a definite responsibility for results—sometimes a

                                <item>In general, the Department of State believes it desirable to
                                    confine statements of policy in legislation to subject matter
                                    which is directly related to the purposes of the legislation.
                                    Any other course tends to produce suspicions of United States
                                    motives and aims. In particular, a seemingly non-relevent
                                    provision tends to supply fuel for anti-American propaganda
                                    attacks embodying the theme that the United States is using its
                                    aid program not merely as a measure for helping to build the
                                    collective strength of the free world, but largely as a device
                                    for pressing America’s special interests in all aspects of
                                    international relations.</item>

                                    colonial peoples would achieve little in a positive nature,
                                    since the responsible elements in dependent territories will
                                    judge the United States by its actions rather than by general
                                    expressions. Statements of this kind tend to be ignored by
                                    people to whom they are addressed, and to be used only by
                                    “trouble makers”.</item>

                                <item>A statement of the kind suggested would almost certainly be
                                    subject to a great deal of misinterpretation among the dependent
                                    peoples, partly unintentional and partly deliberate. For
                                    example, in some areas irresponsible leaders might use such a
                                    statement to convince their followers that the United States
                                    will support even the most fanatical demands against the
                                    colonial powers. Similarly, it might be interpreted as a sign of
                                    weakness and division among the Western powers and thereby
                                    stiffen local leaders against acceptance of compromise solutions
                                    to current disputes. Even Communist elements, masquerading as
                                    legitimate nationalists, could use the statement to advantage,
                                    just as the Communists tried, in the 1948 Italian elections, to
                                    persuade many ignorant voters that the United States did not
                                    care whether they voted Communist or not.</item>

                                <item>The effects within the governing countries would be equally
                                    detrimental to American interests. In countries such as the
                                    United Kingdom, France, Belgium, etc., a probable popular
                                    interpretation of such a statement of policy would be that the
                                    United States is intervening in what most of the national
                                    population believes is a <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0529"
                                    />matter of purely national concern. Anti-American propagandists
                                    in these countries would go much further and would declare (as
                                    they have already done on occasion) that the real aim of the
                                    United States is to use its aid program as a device for
                                    “stealing” the colonies for itself. An argument of this kind
                                    makes a real impression in circumstances where it seems evident
                                    that the colonial territories concerned are actually incapable
                                    of self-government at this time. In either case, the effect is
                                    to arouse resentment against the United States among peoples
                                    whose friendship and cooperation is vital to American security.
                                    Several of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies are
                                    colonial powers, and they have acknowledged their
                                    responsibilities under the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                    Charter, both within the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and
                                    elsewhere. Sometimes we have not agreed with them in their
                                    handling of issues arising in the dependent territories, nor
                                    with their judgments as to the capability of certain dependent
                                    peoples for self-government. However, steps by the United States
                                    which might be interpreted as infringing upon the sovereignty of
                                    these nations might well cause a serious rift between the
                                    countries of the North Atlantic alliance and could conceivably
                                    result in the withdrawal of certain countries from active
                                    participation in the mutual defense program. As a minimum, it
                                    would make the task of the existing governments in these
                                    countries far more difficult, by permitting the political
                                    opposition to play on chauvinist sentiments and to accuse the
                                    government of being subservient to American pressure.</item>

                        concerned about the final action which the Armed Services Committee is going
                        to take today on the bill. The Secretary said that he was hoping that the
                        Committee would not recommend any further cut. The Secretary said that he
                        hoped the Senator had read our note to the USSR which came out this
                            morning.<note n="1" xml:id="d156fn1">Reference is to the tripartite note

                    <p>The Secretary said that from that note the Senator would see that we are in a
                        desperate game with the Russians at the present time to try to push through
                        this consolidation. Everybody knows what we had last year in the bill and
                        knows what we are likely to get this year in the bill. We have two new
                        problems this year. One is the Germans coming in and the new divisions being
                        raised; the other is the attempt to raise and extend capacity of the native
                        army in Indochina. With another cut we cannot take on either of those
                        responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Saltonstall said that he let his proxy yesterday to vote the bill out as
                        is, reserving the right to vote for any further cut on the floor. He said he
                        thought the Committee vote would be extremely close; he didn’t know just how
                        it would go, it might go either way by one or two votes. The Senator said he
                        wouldn’t want to give the impression that if he voted the bill out as it now
                        is, that he wouldn’t vote to cut it further on the floor after he hears all
                        the evidence. Senator Saltonstall said that he thought the Secretary wanted
                        him to tell him frankly what his feelings were, and that is that he would
                        vote as is without any cut but reserve his right to make up his mind after
                        hearing the evidence on the floor.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he would like to give him all the evidence that we
                        have. He said that he talked at some length about the Middle East when he
                        testified last Friday. He said that the Senator was not there but he would
                        be delighted to go over all those parts of the bill with him. The Senator
                        repeated that he would vote as is without any further cut but reserve his
                        right to make up his mind after hearing the evidence. That was his feeling
                        at the moment, he said, and he thought he would stick with it. The Senator
                        said that it was a very difficult vote for him for several reasons, but that
                        was his position.</p>

                        of $6,447,730,750 in foreign aid for appropriation under the Mutual Security
                        Program to free nations resisting Communist aggression beginning July 1. Of
                        the total authorization, $4,598,424,500 is to be used for military
                        assistance and $1,805,288,500 for economic and technical assistance.
                        Authorization is also included totaling $44,017,750 for <gloss

                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> International Children’s Emergency Fund. The
                        total authorization falls short $1,468,750,250 of the $7.9 billion requested
                        by President Truman and it is possible that there will be a further cut in
                        the appropriation legislation.</p>
                    <p>The new legislation contains some provisions that will present increased
                        difficulties in administration, and the sharp reductions in funds authorized
                        will materially handicap certain of the programs. One of the most serious
                        developments in Congressional consideration was the Senate version which
                        included a new Kem amendment to supersede the present Battle Act.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d158fn3">For documentation on the Kem Amendment and the Battle
                            Act, see <ref target="frus1952-54v01p2#pg_817">pp. 817</ref> ff.</note>
                        The Executive Branch opposed the new amendment which was far worse than the
                        original Kem amendment. It provided, with no possibility for exceptions,
                        that all economic, financial, or military assistance should be terminated to
                        any country exporting or knowingly permitting the export <pb n="506"
                            xml:id="pg_506" facs="0532"/>of arms, military matériel, or goods likely
                        to be used in the manufacture of arms or armaments going to the Soviet Union
                        or its satellites or the shipment of which is embargoed or would be refused
                        export licenses by the US. The amendment was struck out in conference. A
                        strong attempt was made on the floor of the Senate to reject this portion of
                        the conference report. Owing to an unusual parliamentary situation, the vote
                        in the Senate could not be taken on a proposal to recommit the bill to
                        conference but had to be taken on the conference report as a whole. The fact
                        that the Senate approved the conference report by a good margin does not
                        give us grounds for complacence, however. Political observers believe that
                        had the vote been taken on the Kem amendment alone, it probably would have
                        passed. There is a possibility that this issue may come up again in the
                        appropriation debate.</p>
                    <p>Another amendment that would have presented serious difficulties had it been
                        adopted would have limited dollar expenditures under the Act for
                        International Development for supplies and equipment in any country for any
                        fiscal year to not more than three times the dollar costs for personnel. The
                        conferees felt that the reduction in <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>
                        funds was a sufficiently restraining factor for this year, and that the
                        proper limit for such expenditures could not be effectively expressed by a
                        mathematical ratio. The conference report points out, however, that supplies
                        and equipment beyond those necessary for demonstration purposes will convert
                        this into a type of world-wide economic aid program our country cannot
                        afford and specified that this should provide adequate notice as to the
                        legislative intent of this program.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Funds Authorized.</hi> Under the new Act, a total of
                        $4,698,047,750 is authorized for Europe for military and defense support
                        purposes. Military and technical assistance in the amount of $741,430,500 is
                        authorized for the Near East and Africa, including funds for Arab and
                        Israeli refugees. Asia and the Pacific have been authorized $886,220,000 for
                        military, economic and technical assistance, and $78,014,750 is provided for
                        Latin American military and technical assistance. As in previous
                        legislation, there is an administrative provision permitting a transfer of
                        funds up to 10% for the purpose for which they were originally intended, at
                        the discretion of the President, between geographic areas.</p>
                    <p>All funds were cut below the amounts requested by the President. The 29.5%
                        reduction in the sum for the defense support of our North Atlantic Treaty
                        allies and other European countries together with the decreased
                        authorization for the furnishing of military end items to European countries
                        (from $4,145,000,000 to $3,415,614,750 or 17.6%) will result in a
                        substantial decrease in their ability to carry through the planned defense
                        build-up. A large <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0533"/>reduction

                        authorization for technical assistance for South Asia, including Burma and
                        Indonesia, which will materially handicap the projected programs in those
                        areas. The Executive Branch favored inclusion of an amendment in the
                        legislation that would provide for continued <gloss target="#t_MSA1"
                            >MSA</gloss> administration in Burma and Indonesia despite US
                        non-participation in any mutual defense programs in those countries. <gloss
                            target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> has been administering in those areas the
                        economic programs originated under the previous Economic Cooperation
                        Administration. Under the new legislation it will be necessary to shift the
                        economic and technical assistance programs in those areas to the
                        administration of the Technical Cooperation Administration.</p>
                    <p>The bill includes an authorization of $9,240,500 for contribution to the
                        Provisional Intergovernmental Committee for the Movement of Migrants from
                        Europe with the stipulation that none of the funds made available for the
                        movement of migrants shall be allocated to any international organization
                        having in its membership any Communist or Communist-dominate or controlled
                        country.</p>
                    <p>A total of $16,481,000 was authorized for the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> International Children’s Emergency Fund. It was specified
                        that in no case should US contributions exceed one-third of the
                        contributions from all governments including government contributions for
                        the benefit of persons located within territories under their control. In
                        addition, none of the funds may be used in duplication of the activities of
                        other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agencies.</p>
                    <p>The bill also provides for a US contribution for multilateral technical
                        assistance programs, authorizing $15,708,750 for the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> and its Specialized Agencies and for the Organization of
                        American States.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Counterpart</hi>. A provision was modified which would have
                        seriously hampered the flexibility of use of counterpart funds. The proposed
                        provision, which the Executive Branch strongly opposed, would, except as
                        otherwise provided, limit use of counterpart funds only for projects of
                        military assistance or defense support. The conferees recognized the
                        desirability of the use of more counterpart funds in the defense effort, but
                        felt that this provision might prevent the use of counterpart under other
                        acts, and for such purposes as US procurement of strategic materials.
                        Furthermore, the conferees felt there was the possibility that under this
                        provision counterpart could not be used in Germany, Austria and Trieste to
                        carry <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0534"/>out programs essential to the
                        security of the US but not strictly within the limitation of this provision
                        The modification limits the programs for which new funds authorized in the
                        1952 Act would be available except as other uses of counterpart are
                        specifically authorized by law.</p>
                    <p>The new legislation increases the availability of counterpart for the
                        procurement of strategic materials to 10% from the previous 5%. The
                        Executive Branch opposed it as it will require renegotiation of bilateral
                        agreements with countries receiving economic assistance, will reduce pro
                        tanto funds available for the military budgets of recipient countries, and
                        may reduce the dollar earning potential of those countries in respect to
                        materials sold to the US.</p>
                    <p>On the positive side, the new legislation provides for setting aside
                        counterpart funds for programs furthering free private enterprise objectives
                        (Benton Amendment). Dollar aid in the amount of $100,000,000 is to be
                        furnished under agreements which will assure that the counterpart derived
                        therefrom shall be used for this purpose. The counterpart funds are to be
                        used to establish revolving funds which shall be available for making loans
                        and carrying out such programs. In this connection, funds not to exceed
                        $2,500,000 may be transferred to the Organization for European Economic
                        Cooperation for the encouragement of free enterprise objectives. In
                        addition, limited amounts of counterpart funds acquired in connection with
                        the foreign-aid programs may be used for the educational exchange funds
                        authorized by the Fulbright Act.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Shipping</hi>. The new legislation clarifies the shipping
                        provisions of the Mutual Defense Assistance Act so that the 50% requirement
                        no longer applies to material purchased by foreign countries from the US on
                        a reimbursable basis. The 50% requirement still applies to other cargo
                        shipped from the US under the Mutual Defense Assistance Act.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Ocean Freight Subsidies</hi>. The authority of the US to
                        pay ocean freight charges on shipments of relief supplies overseas is
                        continued in the 1952 Act. Similar authority is granted in the case of
                        shipments by voluntary non-profit relief agencies (registered with and
                        approved by the Advisory Committee on Foreign Aid) to any country eligible
                        for economic or technical assistance under the Mutual Security Act. The
                        Department will assume the responsibility for administering this program for

                    <p>The Act carries a limitation on personnel in Government agencies
                        administering the Mutual Security Program which will require a reduction in
                        the Washington staffs and will present difficulties in carrying out the
                        program.</p>
                    <p>Another difficulty is presented by the bill’s prohibition of use of any

                        However, at the same time the conferees recognized there should not be any

                        November. The Bureau of the Budget has set a deadline of September 15 for
                        submission of the figures to that office. Mr. Harriman has set August 10 as

                        that this is a reduction of our planning figure for this year. The Bureau of
                        the Budget has also submitted figures by titles and countries, and the
                        Bureau <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0536"/>asks the individual agencies
                        to develop justification for these figures. Mr. Martin pointed out that at
                        the last meeting of <gloss target="#t_MAAC1">MAAC</gloss>, we and <gloss
                            target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> protested the establishment of these
                        figures, and the Bureau of the Budget agreed to submit its assumptions on
                        which the figures were based. Mr. Martin was concerned that this preparation
                        by the Bureau of the Budget freezes to some degree what we might propose and
                        continues programs which we might wish to reexamine. He also questioned the
                        relationship of these planning figures to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                            <gloss target="#t_DMS1">DMS</gloss> will work with the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> on this general problem. Mr. Bohlen pointed
                        out that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> reappraisal, which is
                        general, would not help in the establishment of ceiling figures or
                        individual figures for countries or programs. However, the annexes which are
                        being prepared by the individual agencies might help in this respect. Mr.
                        Martin pointed out that, in effect, we are preparing the annexes before the
                        general report. Mr. Ferguson was inclined to believe that the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> review could be of some assistance. Mr.
                        Bingham added that he was not in sympathy with Mr. Martin’s criticism of the
                        approach by <gloss target="#t_DMS1">DMS</gloss> and the Bureau of the
                        Budget. He felt that it was much better to have these figures now rather
                        than at the last moment as was the case for the 1953 program. He doubted
                        that submission of figures by the Bureau of the Budget would freeze action
                        on the individual agencies involved.</p>

                    <p><gloss target="#t_DMS1">DMS</gloss> and the Bureau of the Budget have
                        prepared a statement, a copy of which has been furnished your

                    <p>Discussion of these assumptions in <gloss target="#t_MAAC1">MAAC</gloss> is
                        scheduled for early July. Comments from interested parts of the Department

                        insofar as possible with other interested departmental offices, be available
                        in <gloss target="#t_SMSA1">S/MSA</gloss> not later than August 3rd to

                            target="#t_DMS1">DMS</gloss> has been given until September 15 to submit

                        on that date.</p>
                    <p>At the June 25th meeting it was agreed that the Department should take “a
                        fresh look” at the foreign aid program for 1954. There should be a
                        comprehensive and realistic appraisal of United States objectives in all
                        areas of the world, and an evaluation should be made of these objectives to
                        determine what has been accomplished and what remains to be done in order to
                        determine how best to proceed in 1954, i.e. are the instrumentalities and
                        techniques now being employed the most effective and efficient which could
                        be utilized for the purposes envisioned? A series of project assignments
                        designed to accomplish this is attached.</p>
                    <p>Several of these projects attack from different angles the single central
                        problem of how we should give aid to under-developed areas. Basically there
                        are four types of economic aid which may go to under-developed areas: <list>

                    <p>The examination of the Locke project<note n="2" xml:id="d160fn2">See footnote
                            4, <ref target="#pg_473">p. 473</ref>.</note> is primarily an
                        examination of how we wish to conduct our program in an area in which
                        elements of type 2 and 3 aid, and type 4 aid for relief, are all
                        involved.</p>

                        a combined type 2 and 3 program, with elements of type 4 to assist in
                        financing the latter.</p>
                    <p>The re-examination of our programs in the Far East, other than those which
                        are pretty clearly justified as type 1 defense programs—Formosa and
                        Indochina—is designed to give guidance as to what in fact we are trying to
                        do in Burma, Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia. Then we can decide, in
                        the light of this study and of the other projects, what are the best means
                        for accomplishing these purposes.</p>
                    <p>The African project on Dependent Overseas Territory programs is an example of
                        an essentially type 2 program, with some elements of a type 3 program, which
                        is being accomplished, however, within a type 1 defense support framework,
                        insofar as legislative authority is concerned.</p>
                    <p>The emergency project is an attempt to face up to the fact that the provision
                        of type 4 aid for emergency purposes, such as famine relief, is not possible
                        within the spirit, arid only to a very limited extent within the letter, of
                        the Mutual Security Program as it now stands.</p>
                    <p>While the emphasis on these projects is primarily in terms of objectives, of
                        legislative authority, and to some extent of agency responsibility, the
                        examination of our basic objectives will involve decisions as to which ones
                        we do want to continue to seek with U.S. funds and will thus have an
                        influence on the amounts to be requested for these countries for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954.</p>
                    <p>While some of these re-examinations can be completed within a relatively
                        short period of time, some of them may take somewhat longer and it may be
                        necessary to make our <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 justification
                        submittals to <gloss target="#t_DMS1">DMS</gloss> prior to their completion.
                        We believe that this can be done and arrangements worked out with <gloss
                            target="#t_DMS1">DMS</gloss> for necessary amendments up to the date
                        when <gloss target="#t_DMS1">DMS</gloss> must submit to the Bureau of the
                        Budget. Nevertheless, projects should be pursued with a considerable amount
                        of urgency. <gloss target="#t_SMSA1">S/MSA</gloss> will hold approximately
                        weekly meetings with those responsible to discuss progress.</p>
                    <p>Since all the projects involve aspects of our economic foreign policy, it is
                        assumed that representatives of <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss> will be
                        consulted and work with the unit having primary responsibility in each case.
                            <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> is also being invited to indicate
                        those projects in which they would like to participate. In addition,
                        attention is called to certain other units which should be consulted in the
                        development of a proposal for consideration as a Department position. It is
                        urged that any <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0539"/>major differences of
                        view be brought promptly to the attention of <gloss target="#t_SMSA1"
                            >S/MSA</gloss> so that we can be of assistance in resolving them.</p>

                            Program</hi></p>
                    <p>The Supplemental Appropriations Bill for 1953 as signed by the President
                        appropriates $6,001,947,250 for foreign aid to nations resisting Communist
                        aggression—a cut of 25% from the amount originally requested by the
                        executive branch. This was a reduction of $445,783,000 below the amount
                        included in the authorizing legislation. In relation to the original
                        executive branch request, the final appropriation bill carried over-all
                        funds in the amount of $4,219,834,500 for military assistance. This
                        represented a cut of <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515" facs="0541"/>$1,205,165,500
                        from the asking figure of $5,425,000,000. Funds for all other purposes were
                        cut by $692,887,250 to a final figure of $1,782,112,750 as compared to the
                        President’s original request of $2,475,000,000.</p>
                    <p>The US agencies concerned are now attempting to determine how much money
                        individual countries will receive under the final appropriation bill, and
                        are studying the possibility of shifting funds in order to help the most
                        hard-pressed areas. Consideration is also being given to going to Congress
                        for a deficiency appropriation to increase aid to South Asia, with
                        particular reference to India, whose economic assistance cut was the most
                        drastic. According to tentative allocations based on the amounts
                        appropriated, only about $44 million are now available for India, compared
                        to last year’s $50 million.</p>
                    <p>The Point IV appropriation for South and Southeast Asia including India,
                        Pakistan, Burma and Indonesia suffered a 60% cut to $67,793,000 from the
                        original request of $178,000,000 and an authorized amount of $118,634,250.
                        The over-all Asian military and economic assistance program was cut to
                        $811,378,750 from the $1,019,230,000 originally asked, a reduction of
                        $207,851,250. The amount authorized was $886,220,000.</p>
                    <p>Europe’s aid program was also severely cut back in the appropriating
                        legislation, with a total cut for military, economic and technical
                        assistance of $287,390,000, bringing the amount available to $4,410,657,750
                        from the authorized figure of $4,698,047,750. The total amount originally
                        requested by the President for Europe was $5,964,200,000.</p>
                    <p>The Near East and Africa suffered cuts of $61,200,500, bringing their
                        appropriation for military, economic and technical assistance, and Arab and
                        Israeli refugees from $741,430,500 to $680,230,000. The President had asked
                        for $802,370,000.</p>
                    <p>Latin American countries were cut a flat $6 million from $78,014,750 to
                        $72,014,750; the original request had been $84,400,000. Multilateral
                        technical assistance was cut to $9,171,333 from the authorization of
                        $15,708,750. The President had asked $17,000,000 for this purpose. Our

                        packages; the amount authorized and appropriated amounted to $2,587,500. No
                        money was sought for <gloss target="#t_UNICEF1">UNICEF</gloss>, <pb n="516"
                            xml:id="pg_516" facs="0542"/>but Congress appropriated $6,666,667, after
                        having authorized $16,481,000.</p>
                    <p>In criticizing the appropriation, President Truman called the Congressional
                        action the poorest kind of economy, stressing that the cuts came at a time
                        when many countries are facing severe economic strains. He expressed the
                        opinion that the cut in Indian aid was extremely dangerous, for that country
                        is now engaged in a tremendous effort to build up its own economy and living
                        standards, to show that democratic methods can succeed in curing present
                        conditions in Asia. The President also expressed his conviction that
                        Congress itself will eventually find it necessary to make additional funds
                        available during this fiscal year.</p>

                            Office of the Director for Mutual Security stated that it represents
                            essentially the synthesis of materials separately submitted by the
                            Department of State, the Department of Defense, and the Mutual Security
                            Agency, relative to the segments of the Mutual Security Program
                            administered by each of them. The Office of the Director for Mutual
                            Security did not have an opportunity fully to review and evaluate
                            certain of the important data submitted by the operating agencies, nor,
                            in cases where the data appeared inadequate or unsatisfactory, to secure
                            appropriate revisions therein. Accordingly, the report is presented with
                            the understanding that certain of its major assumptions and conclusions
                            may be subject to modification as the result of more thorough study and
                            more extensive inter-agency coordination. In view of the rigid time
                            schedule there was not any opportunity to have the material, as
                            synthesized by the Office of the Director for Mutual Security, formally
                            cleared by the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and the
                            Mutual Security Agency prior to its transmittal. In the event that
                            either Department or the Mutual Security Agency has any major
                            reservations on its contents, the Office of the Director for Mutual
                            Security will submit a supplemental memorandum, either modifying the
                            report accordingly or indicating any divergent views. A significant
                            portion of the data, forecasts, and conclusions relating to the military
                            assistance program is premised on estimates of total fiscal 1953
                            end-item deliveries which are at this stage highly tentative and subject

                        Instead of continuing to plan with reference to the Medium Term Defense Plan
                        force goals for 1954 it was decided to predicate programs and policy
                        objectives upon force commitments undertaken year by year by <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners, after a thorough collective
                        review of their politico-economic capabilities in relation to force goals
                        which the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Military Committee and
                        Standing Group proposed as militarily desirable. In line with this new
                        approach, the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries adopted at
                        Lisbon in February a series of force goals for December 31, 1952, to which
                        each country firmly committed itself, together with preliminary goals for
                        1953 and planning guides for 1954.</p>
                    <p>On the basis of information received from U.S. military authorities in
                        Europe, there will be a shortfall of at least 15 divisions in the Lisbon
                        goal of 43⅔ divisions for the European <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        countries (i.e., excluding the U.S. and Canada) which were to be raised and
                        brought to prescribed standards of combat readiness by December 31, 1952.
                        M-Day divisions will be only 2⅓ short of the 19-division goal, the balance
                        of the shortfall being in divisions in readiness categories M+3 through
                        M+30. These latter divisions are substantially all in being, but it is not
                        anticipated they will meet the prescribed readiness standards by December
                        31.</p>
                    <p>As to air forces, slight shortfalls are anticipated in the numbers of
                        aircraft—about 90 out of the total goal of 3,276 frontline aircraft
                        (excluding U.S. and Canada). The fact that no allowance for combat reserves
                        has been made, coupled with deficiencies in training and organization, makes
                        the situation considerably less satisfactory than these figures would
                        indicate. Prospective shortfalls in navy goals are restricted to escorts,
                        minesweepers, and submarines, but are nevertheless deemed significant in
                        view of the missions contemplated.</p>
                    <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0544"/>
                    <p>One important factor in the shortfall is the delay of the European nations in
                        raising and, especially, in effectively training forces. Another factor
                        which, while less important as of June 30, 1952, threatens to become more
                        serious in coming months, is the delay in deliveries from the U.S. of <gloss
                            target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> military matériel.</p>
                    <p>Targets indicated in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 114/1 were that the
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1952 <gloss target="#t_MDAP1"
                            >MDAP</gloss> program (worldwide) would be delivered by December 31,
                        1952, with the exception of certain aircraft and other long-lead items.
                        Consistent with this forecast, the U.S. agreed, during the TCC review last
                        fall, to the adoption, for planning purposes only, in connection with
                        setting <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense budgets and force
                        goals, of the assumption that end-item deliveries from U.S. and Canada to
                        the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1952 and 1953 combined would total $9.8 billion. Current
                        estimates indicate that actual deliveries during this period will not exceed
                        $6 billion. Continuance of Korean attrition, general shortfalls in U.S.
                        munitions production, and the recent steel strike have all been factors in
                        reducing the total supply of materiel available.</p>
                    <p>On January 9, 1952, the President issued a directive to the Secretary of

                        country defense budgets for the financing of major matériel procurement made
                        it impossible fully to utilize this capacity. The U.S. Government during the
                        last half of fiscal 1952 placed in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        area over $600 million worth of offshore procurement <pb n="519"

                        procurement and through country defense budgets—will take up a large part of

                    <p><gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 114/1 noted that lack of political
                        cohesion and resoluteness on the part of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> countries in the adoption of and adherence to defense
                        build-up programs was a major limiting factor in the accomplishment of U.S.
                        objectives in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area. The successful
                        completion of the TCC review of politico-economic capabilities last fall,
                        coupled with the adoption of firm December 31, 1952, force goals at Lisbon,
                        were encouraging steps toward remedying these deficiencies. Securing the
                        adoption of adequate legislation on military service, and assuring that
                        defense budget expenditures meet the levels required to support the
                        scheduled forces, remain major problems. There have been strong pressures
                        for a stretch-out of the defense build-up period, particularly with respect
                        to defense production. While periods of conscription have generally been
                        lengthened since Korea, serious difficulties are being met in extending them
                        to fully adequate levels. In summary, still to be accomplished is the
                        basically political task of reconciling the high military requirements of
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense with the limited
                        capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries to meet
                        these requirements.</p>
                    <p>Despite these difficulties, the past year has in many respects been a period
                        of remarkable progress in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Problems
                        which a year ago appeared insoluble have now either been solved or are well
                        on the way toward solution. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> has been
                        given a sense of direction and a concentration of purpose which it
                        previously had lacked. In addition to the TCC exercise and adoption of the
                        Lisbon force goals, two notable accomplishments were the adherence of Greece
                        and Turkey, and laying the groundwork for bringing the Federal Republic of
                        Germany into the European defense scheme through the <gloss target="#t_EDC1"
                            >EDC</gloss> treaty and related arrangements. The difficult task of

                        still remains. Its accomplishment is of major importance to the success of

                                aggregate terms, with emphasis on appraising the country’s general
                                financial capacity rather than on determining the precise forward
                                requirements which would correspond to the desired force goals and

                        it can still be stated categorically that vigorous efforts will have to be
                        made if the U.S. is to meet even the substantially reduced end-item delivery
                        targets outlined in this report. Furthermore, if the major objective of
                        building up the European defense production potential is to be realized, the
                        responsible agencies of the U.S. Government must take major steps to secure
                        the placement of offshore procurement contracts in a pattern consistent with
                        this objective.</p>

                        characterized Austria since 1945 continued during the past year. However,
                        since the major parties have concentrated on the protection of the interest
                        groups which they represent, Austrian economic policy has been one of
                        compromise and expediency, satisfactory to neither party and frequently
                        detrimental to the interests of Austria as a whole. Pressures by the U.S.,
                        U.K., and France to conclude a peace treaty with Austria have proved
                        fruitless. The Soviets have refused to attend a meeting of the Treaty
                        Deputies since 1950 and have rejected an Allied proposal for a short-form

                    <p>A military aid program of $70 million (Stockpile A) was set up in fiscal
                        1950, the plan being to turn the matériel over to Austria when a peace
                        treaty was signed and an armed establishment was authorized. So far, there
                        has been no implementation of the program, except for the issuance of small
                        arms and personal equipment for the training of <hi rend="italic"

                    <p>Under the postwar bilateral programs, Austria has received more than $1.5
                        billion in grant aid. Since Austria is prohibited from engaging in a defense
                        program, this aid has been primarily directed toward assisting Austria to
                        achieve the productive potential to achieve economic viability. This
                        objective has been accomplished in large measure. Despite this evidence of
                        progress, basic problems still await resolution. Among these are inflation,
                        continuation of balance of payments deficit, low productivity, and the
                        general rigidity of the economy, which has impeded expansion of the economic
                        base.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">b. Yugoslavia</hi>. The stability of the Yugoslav

                        its satellites, on the one hand, and Yugoslavia, <pb n="522" xml:id="pg_522"
                            facs="0548"/>on the other, did not lessen during the year. The rift
                        between them still appears to be unbridgeable. Yugoslavia’s relations with
                        Italy have become more hostile and more potentially explosive as the result
                        of the U.S.–U.K.–Italian understanding concerning Zone A of the Free
                        Territory of Trieste. On the other hand, Yugoslavia’s relations with Greece
                        and Turkey became markedly more cordial in the period.</p>
                    <p>Yugoslavia had on hand, as of June 30, ground and naval forces of
                        approximately the size contemplated in <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                        force goals. Considerable expansion of air forces is planned. Combat
                        effectiveness of all services is rated as low by U.S. standards, the
                        greatest weakness being lack of modern equipment.</p>
                    <p>The tripartite aid programs have in large part enabled Yugoslavia to maintain
                        and enlarge its army and preserve minimum living standards, despite the
                        disruption of trade patterns as a result of the 1948 Cominform break and the
                        1950 drought. In addition, the U.S. Government has directed its influence
                        toward securing a consolidation and reduction of the unrealistic Yugoslav
                        investment program, and a postponement of large loan repayments during the
                        period of aid. The aid has, nevertheless, enabled the Yugoslav Government to
                        continue its development program along more modest lines by encouraging the
                        long-term financing of capital imports by the International Bank.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">c. Spain</hi>. The Spanish Government has been stable and
                        the strength of the Communist Party as a disrupting influence in Spain is
                        considered to be insignificant. Economically, the major problems faced are
                        low production, maldistribution of income, and inflation. To date, the only
                        U.S. aid program to have been implemented in Spain is the $62.5 million loan
                        authorized in fiscal 1951. Administered by the Export-Import Bank,
                        substantially all the loan funds have now been committed, about half for
                        basic current imports and half for capital development.</p>
                    <p>In fiscal 1952 the Congress appropriated $100 million exclusively for
                        military, economic and technical assistance to Spain under terms and
                        conditions to be established by the President. So far, none of these funds
                        have been allotted or obligated, pending the outcome of negotiations
                        currently under way with Spain for conclusion of necessary bilateral aid
                        agreements for military and for economic assistance. These agreements are,
                        in turn, contingent upon the broader negotiations now being carried on with
                        the Spanish Government in connection with base rights.</p>

                        Military assistance in the Near East and African areas was extended during
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1952 to Greece, Turkey and Iran,
                        continuing programs which <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0549"/>had been
                        in existence since 1947 in Greece and Turkey, and since 1948 in Iran.</p>
                    <p>The Greek forces as a whole are considered well-led, satisfactorily trained,
                        and, except for some matériel shortages, prepared to carry out their wartime
                        mission. With steady progress in combat worthiness, with the aid equipment
                        already granted and with the materiel to be delivered against <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 program requests, Greek forces are
                        believed capable of repelling attacks by Soviet satellite forces and causing
                        a maximum delay in such an attack even if it is directly assisted by the
                        USSR.</p>
                    <p>Turkish forces are regarded as capable of defending successfully the areas to
                        which they have been assigned against the types of units which are likely to
                        be employed against them, unless they are overwhelmingly outnumbered. Their
                        mission is essentially one of defense of Turkey. Units are not equipped or
                        prepared for overseas movement, although consideration is being given to the
                        possibility of Turkish participation in the defense of neighboring Middle
                        Eastern territory.</p>
                    <p>The military program of the Iranian Government is designed for maintenance of
                        internal security with but limited capacity to resist aggression. With
                        regard to <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> standards, strength in terms
                        of manpower is within 5% of the approved goals. Equipment is generally
                        adequate, considering training and capacity to absorb. Serious deficiencies
                        in leadership, planning, training and logistical support restrict military
                        effectiveness to the maintenance of internal order.</p>
                    <p>Cumulative deliveries to the three countries against <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1950–52 programs amounted to $320 million—36% of the total
                        programmed amount.</p>
                    <p>The admission of Greece and Turkey into <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        took place only at the Lisbon meeting in February. Consequently, neither
                        country’s military contribution enters into the so-called Lisbon force
                        goals. Nevertheless, both Greece and Turkey have raised and maintained force
                        levels up to approved <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> standards, and far
                        beyond their ability to support without continued U.S. or other assistance.
                        Both lack the industrial and technical base to supply military matériel on a
                        large scale or to provide a substantial proportion of the “common use” items
                        required by the armed forces: petroleum products, medical supplies, and even
                        some food and clothing items. Economic aid programs in Greece and Turkey
                        were adjusted to take account of defense requirements, which consume about
                        40% of the total government budget in each country.</p>
                    <p>Economic aid programs throughout the balance of the Near East and African
                        area were keyed to meet the crucial Arab refugee problem, the neutralism in
                        international relations which has characterized the Arab world, and the
                        deterioration in Israel’s economic <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0550"
                        />capabilities during a period of rapid economic expansion and heavy
                        absorption of immigrants. $50 million were provided under Section 205 of the
                        Mutual Security Act of 1951 for refugee relief and resettlement in Israel.
                        In addition, $13.5 million was made available for economic assistance to
                        Israel. Critical foreign exchange shortages made it necessary to provide the
                        bulk of such aid in the form of reimbursements to the Israel Government for
                        expenditures already made toward these ends.</p>
                    <p>Point Four efforts in the area ranged from relatively small efforts in Iraq
                        and Saudi Arabia to more elaborate proposals for Iran, Israel, Jordan and
                        Lebanon. Programs have been kept small in oil-rich Iraq and Saudi Arabia,
                        but maintained to induce the adoption of mutually beneficial projects which
                        would not otherwise be undertaken. In the less-fortunate neighboring states
                        and in North Africa, where the need for technical assistance is equally
                        pressing, the United States is accepting a larger portion of the financial
                        burden. Throughout the area, however, the main accomplishment of the year
                        was the final signature of Point Four general agreements and the
                        determination of specific program needs. There was relatively little
                        substantive progress to report. Notable exceptions are the Israel trainee
                        program, the U.S. finance team in Saudi Arabia, the well-advanced Liberian
                        program, and Iranian “impact” programs in locust control, malaria control
                        and well-drilling.</p>
                    <p>Communist influence in most of these countries during <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1952 has been negligible or non-existent. In most countries
                        the Communist Party has been officially outlawed. Party organization appears
                        to be weak and ineffectual throughout most of the area. Communist strength,
                        however, made itself felt in Iran and Egypt. In both countries, nationalist
                        extremists joined forces temporarily with Communist groups in outbursts of
                        violence against government forces. In Iran the Communist (Tudeh) Party
                        shows evidence of recent gains in strength and organization. In each case
                        the nationalist group broke with the Communists after a brief period of
                        common cause, but the speed and success with which the Communists united
                        with nationalist fanatics to whip up anti-Western emotion gives cause for
                        concern.</p>
                    <p>The political unrest in Iran is inextricably bound up with the economic
                        crisis brought about by expropriation of British petroleum properties.
                        Western defense planning has had to be adjusted in the light of the total
                        loss of Iranian oil. The Iranian economy has been seriously disrupted by the
                        loss of oil revenues. The <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1952 Iranian
                        Point Four program included a $5 million U.S.-financed commodity import
                        program under the fairly flexible Act for International Development
                        interpretation which obtained during the year. A further extension of this
                        type of economic assistance <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0551"/>seems
                        inevitable. To avert the possibility of Communist domination in Iran, the
                        United States may have to extend special economic assistance.</p>
                    <p>Progress in initiating development projects under the technical cooperation
                        program was, in the main, disappointingly slow, particularly in the Arab
                        States. The underdeveloped countries of the area showed considerable
                        reluctance in committing themselves to joint programs of technical
                        cooperation. Arab resentment over the volume of assistance accorded to
                        Israel complicated the problem, In addition, the task of locating, hiring
                        and securing clearances for technicians created a further barrier to
                        progress. Less than 50% of authorized U.S. personnel were on duty in the
                        field as of June 30, 1952.</p>
                    <p>There is now insufficient legal authority to carry on the types of economic
                        development programs designed to meet the long-range problems of the area.
                        Some countries, e.g., Syria, require, in addition to present programs for
                        technical education, long-range programs for capital development. The Act
                        for International Development is now limited by Congressional action in
                        connection with the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 appropriation
                        requests to the furnishing of “technical assistance” in the sense of
                        technical demonstration work. Commodity and capital assistance is generally
                        limited to programs directly related to this basic educational objective. If
                        the United States is to contribute more directly to the solution of the
                        long-range development problems, the scope of presently legal economic aid
                        activities would have to be broadened by law to include assistance for
                        fundamental economic development.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Far East and South Asia</hi>. Political instability and
                        threats to internal security are significant factors in most of the
                        countries of this area. One of the major objectives of U.S. policy is,
                        accordingly, to increase popular support for the governments. With the
                        possible exception of Thailand, and in spite of occasional temporary
                        setbacks elsewhere, there is growing evidence that the presence of American
                        aid missions is steadily creating a climate of opinion that enables local
                        governments to push ahead courageously with internal economic and social
                        reforms without which the loyalty and the faith of the people in the cause
                        of the free world, and their willingness to fight for that cause if
                        necessary, cannot be expected to exist.</p>
                    <p>To further the U.S. objective of strengthening against aggression the present
                        moderate and western-oriented governments of this area, the U.S. has
                        undertaken major military assistance programs for Indo-China and the Chinese
                        Nationalists. <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> force goals for Indo-China
                        were set on the assumption that there would be no invasion by the Chinese
                        Communists. Measured against these goals, <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526"
                            facs="0552"/>good progress has been made. The build-up of French forces
                        has approximately attained these goals. 50% attainment is reported with
                        respect to the native forces of Vietnam, Laotia [<hi rend="italic"
                        >Laos</hi>], and Cambodia. Nevertheless, despite the highest priority having
                        been given to allocations of military matériel, less than ¼ of the army
                        program so far financed (exclusive of Lisbon off-shore procurement) had been
                        shipped by June 30, and less than 15% of programmed air force matériel.</p>
                    <p>As to Formosa, forces are numerically about at the level prescribed in <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> goals, which assume that their mission will
                        be the defense of Formosa. However, available equipment is scanty and combat
                        effectiveness of all three services is rated at 20–25%. Enough <gloss
                            target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> matériel was programmed through fiscal
                        1952 to supply about 50% of the equipment needs of ground forces Shipments
                        by June 30 had reached 30% of the amount so far programmed. Out of the $120
                        million air force program, shipments were 1%.</p>
                    <p>About 15–20% of the programs approved for the Philippines and Thailand (about
                        $100 million each) had been shipped by June 30.</p>
                    <p>In Indo-China, Formosa, the Philippines, and Thailand, the U.S. had
                        undertaken economic and technical assistance programs designed to strengthen
                        the financial and economic fibre of these countries, thereby permitting
                        their governments to maintain internal security and stability and provide a
                        solid base for their defense efforts.</p>
                    <p>U.S. economic and technical assistance programs in Indo-China have three main
                        purposes: (a) provide economic support for the French and Indochinese
                        anti-Communist military forces; (b) at the same time assist in securing a
                        greatly improved effectiveness on the part of the newly created governments
                        of the Associated States, without which nothing better than stalemate
                        appears possible; and (c) help increase production and pave the way for
                        future economic development. Critically needed support has been given to the
                        military forces through repair and maintenance (little actual improvement
                        has been possible) of highways, bridges, ports and waterways; through care
                        and resettlement of refugees from combat and guerrilla areas; and in various
                        indirect ways. Although the governments have far to go in recognizing and
                        forcefully grappling with their responsibilities for providing leadership
                        and basic services to their people, the <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>
                        Program has registered some initial gains on this front. Production,
                        particularly of rice, has been assisted to some extent.</p>
                    <p>In Formosa the principal purposes of economic aid programs are: (1) to
                        support the military establishment, (b) to maintain a standard of living
                        adequate to insure support of the Government by the <pb n="527"
                            xml:id="pg_527" facs="0553"/>general population and prevent unrest that
                        would endanger internal security, and (c) to help the island become
                        independent of outside economic assistance in a relatively short period.</p>
                    <p>The program has effectively buttressed the military effort by bringing in
                        common-use imports and supplying counterpart to cover the associated local
                        costs, and by helping to rehabilitate vital transport and power facilities,
                        etc. Through heavy commodity imports (mainly producer goods), active
                        participation in the work of the Economic Stabilization Board, and support
                        of the many-sided work of the Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction
                        (JCRR) among the peasants, the program has also had a marked degree of
                        success in offsetting the heavy economic strain imposed by military
                        expenditures. Economic stability has been substantially maintained. Price
                        curves have tended to flatten out. Notwithstanding multiple burdens on the
                        farmer, he appears, on balance, to be at least as well off as pre-war.
                        Communist-inspired unrest is of negligible proportions. The program has
                        contributed substantially to the industrial expansion now in process. Aid to
                        basic utilities, help in building fertilizer production capacity,
                        importation for sale of vital raw materials and manufacturing equipment
                        items, and the financing of a broad engineering advisory contract with a
                        private American firm have all played a significant part. The point has just
                        now been reached where joint consideration with the Chinese of a timetable
                        for termination of economic aid appears feasible.</p>
                    <p>In the Philippines, economic and technical assistance is designed to: (a)
                        improve the efficiency, integrity and vitality of government administration;
                        (b) institute economic and social measures for the improvement of the living
                        standards of the people, both as a necessary means of achieving internal
                        security and in order to strengthen the permanent foundations of a
                        democratic society; (c) build up production both for local use and for
                        export; and (d) spark an economic development program involving
                        diversification of activity and affording maximum opportunity for private
                        enterprise. The program has secured measurable improvement in tax assessment
                        and collection, customs, and import controls; stimulated a broad effort to
                        raise competence in public administration generally; been partially
                        responsible for a marked rise in agricultural production; launched promising
                        campaigns in public health and education; and made a successful start in
                        assisting in the settlement of the large and fertile island of Mindanao,
                        which is proving an important factor in pacification of the Huks. A vigorous
                        effort to promote industrial expansion and diversification, on a
                        private-enterprise basis, is about to begin. Social reforms, however, are
                        encountering difficulty, despite earlier pledges. For lack of political
                        support, success <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0554"/>is not being
                        achieved at the moment in securing needed legislation to ameliorate the lot
                        of the farmer and laborer.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">American Republics</hi>. U.S. programs in this area must
                        be conducted against a background of far-reaching political, social and
                        economic adjustments. These adjustments have afforded nationalist and
                        Communist groups a wide opportunity to provoke dissension in existing
                        political institutions and to associate the so-called economic imperialism
                        of the United States with the underdevelopment of the area. While political
                        instability has been no worse than in the past, most of the governments have
                        been preoccupied with domestic problems.</p>
                    <p>Despite this preoccupation, the majority of Latin American governments favor
                        collective defense of the hemisphere. U.S. Military Grant Aid programs for
                        the Title IV countries (first provided for in the <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1952 <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> program) have
                        been designed for a very limited objective: to meet equipment and training
                        deficiencies of selected units of certain Latin American nations which these
                        nations have agreed to earmark for specific missions of hemisphere defense,
                        missions which would otherwise, in the event of war, require the deployment
                        of U.S. forces. Bilateral military assistance agreements have been or are
                        being negotiated with the more important governments. 7 have been signed to
                        date. As of June 30, no shipments of military assistance matériel had been
                        made to Title IV countries, since program refinements and matériel
                        deliveries were delayed by agreement negotiations. Programs totaling more
                        than $34 million had been established, however, and the initial shipment
                        went forward on July 25.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1952 technical cooperation program was
                        predicated upon the demonstrated ability of the Latin American governments
                        effectively to utilize Point Four type assistance, coupled with the manifest
                        need to encourage political stability. Another major purpose was to increase
                        the production of strategic materials. The $19 million in available funds
                        (including carry-overs from <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1951) provided
                        an important contribution to the attainment of U.S. political and economic
                        objectives in the region. But the total program, amplified by private and
                        public loans, private investment and expenditures of local governments, was
                        enormously larger. Against the availability from U.S. funds of $19 million,
                        the Latin American governments contributed about $28 million toward the cost
                        of technical cooperation programs, a less favorable ratio than had obtained
                        in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1951. This ratio did not reflect a
                        smaller total participation in program cost, but rather a larger U.S.
                        participation. The 1951 ratio of three to one is expected to be
                        reattained.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">United Nations Programs</hi>. Of the many international

                    <p><gloss target="#t_UNRWA1">UNRWA</gloss> was established in 1950 to resolve
                        the problem of 850,000 Arab refugees from Palestine who have been recipients
                        of relief from the United Nations since 1948. Its activities are
                        concentrated in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq. During <gloss

                        over $93 million, against $64 million from 41 other nations. The
                        contribution in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1952 was $50 million. The

                        ending June 30, 1954 calls for $250 million, of which $200 is earmarked for
                        rehabilitation and $50 for relief. Relief expenditures are to be reduced
                        from the level of $27 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1952 to
                        $18 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 and to $5 million in

                        integration into the Near Eastern Economy of some 150,000 refugee
                        families.</p>

                        Assistance program, to which the U.S. contributed over $12 million, was
                        supported by 55 countries and operated in 69 countries. 64 countries have
                        pledged support for the “second financial period” (calendar 1952), and 81
                        countries have requested technical specialists or training services. The
                        U.S. pledge for 1952 is $11 million. As of June 1, 1952, 681 experts were

                        U.S.: it has demonstrated its ability to operate in areas where activity
                        would be difficult for the U.S. alone; it costs less to operate since the
                        U.S. pays only part of the expense; and it makes possible the utilization of
                        foreign specialists in fields where U.S. technicians might be difficult to
                        find. It is true, however, that <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> programs
                        have been carried on in many of the countries where the U.S. has also been

                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> governments, with the exception of
                        France, are rated as being generally stable and as giving reasonable promise
                        of continuity for at least the next year or so. The Pinay government is
                        relatively more stable than recent French governments, although the chances
                        for its survival for a considerable period after the Assembly reconvenes in
                        October are not rated as particularly good. The Governments of the United
                        Kingdom, Belgium, and Denmark do not enjoy very comfortable margins in the
                        parliamentary majorities at their command, a fact that frequently weakens
                        their ability to take a firm, all-out stand on issues related to the
                        fulfilment of their <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitments. In
                        the U.K., however, the defense program was initiated by the Labor government
                        and receives the support of the Labor Party, except for the Bevanite
                        minority. The Italian Government is prevented from taking positive action on
                        many issues because of the forthcoming national elections. Aside from
                        communism, there are no serious threats to internal political stability in
                        any of the European <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries. The
                        rising power of the right in Italy and the royalist question in Belgium are
                        potential threats to internal stability, although neither of these is felt
                        to be immediate.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">b</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Communist strength</hi>. The
                        Communist Party appears to be a major threat only in France and Italy. In
                        other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, notably the
                        Scandinavian members, the Netherlands, and the U.K., the Communist potential
                        for undermining internal security and contributing to governmental
                        instability is almost non-existent. Although not a serious threat, there are
                        some areas of Communist strength in certain other countries, such as Belgium
                        and Western Germany. For example, controlling Communist infiltration of the
                        key labor unions remains a troublesome problem in Belgium.</p>
                    <p>Communist Party membership and voting strength in Western Europe have
                        declined sharply since the early post-war years. Total membership in the
                        European <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries and Western Germany
                        is estimated to have declined from 3,500,000 in 1946 to 2,600,000 at
                        present. In countries other than France and Italy, Communist voting strength
                        has been about cut in half during the past four or five years.</p>
                    <p>The French Communist Party remains a powerful and cohesive organization
                        claiming around 650,000 members, and is rated as having a high capacity for
                        subversive activity. In the case of Italy, <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531"
                            facs="0557"/>the recent elections indicate that the government parties
                        have lost 25% of their electoral support since 1948. This has caused the
                        Italian Government to postpone or avoid positive action on a number of vital
                        matters until after the national elections in the spring of 1953.</p>
                    <p>For the coming year, the outcome of next year’s national election will be not
                        only crucial for Italy but extremely important for the West as a whole.
                        Should the Democratic parties fail to command a working majority in the new
                        parliament, the road to Communist domination will be open. Should the
                        Democratic elements be placed in a minority, a Communist take-over would be
                        nearly immediate unless prevented by an alliance of the Center parties with
                        neo-Fascists or other extreme right elements or both. In either case, the
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and united Western front would be
                        seriously shaken.</p>

                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was in a critical situation. Despite many
                        long months of discussion in Council meetings and elsewhere, no agreement
                        had been reached on such pressing problems as German participation in
                        Western defense and the admission of Greece and Turkey into <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        had no adequate knowledge of where it stood or of where it was going. There
                        was widespread feeling that military requirements, as embodied in the Medium
                        Term Defense Plan, were not realistic. Too much emphasis was placed on
                        long-range planning and not enough on the need for a rapid build-up to meet
                        the immediate danger. There was no clear idea of the political and economic
                        capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries.
                        Confusion as to the scope of the North Atlantic Treaty led many Europeans to
                        think that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was being used by the U.S.
                        solely as a military alliance without regard for the development of closer
                        political and economic ties. Finally, there were serious defects in the
                        organization of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> which resulted in
                        duplication of effort and general inability to reach decisions and take
                        action. All these factors produced dissatisfaction and discouragement, and,
                        as a result, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was for a time unable to
                        move ahead at an adequate pace in many areas.</p>
                    <p>One of the major achievements of the past year in clearing the way for
                        further progress in the defense build-up was the work of the Temporary
                        Committee of the Council. As a result of the TCC’s work, <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> gained several things which it previously
                        lacked. First, it gained a realistic and carefully screened statement of its
                        military requirements, as prepared by the Screening and Costing Staff (SCS).
                        Second, an over-all program was drawn up which, for the first time, tackled
                        the problem of reconciling military requirements with the political and
                        economic capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations.
                        The TCC force recommendations were accepted by the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> countries with a minimum of political strain, although the
                        Belgians <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0558"/>at first objected strongly
                        to the approach used. These recommendations formed the basis for the 1952
                        force goals agreed to at Lisbon. The force goals placed emphasis on the
                        immediate build-up, rather than on long-range plans for the distant
                        future.</p>
                    <p>The Lisbon agreements did a great deal to restore confidence in the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> program. Governments were given definite
                        targets and a firm basis for future planning, as well as assurance that the
                        U.S. would not try to push <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries
                        to the point where they would be threatened with internal collapse. As a
                        result, the people in the European countries gained confidence that <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was succeeding. The advantages gained
                        from the TCC experience are to be continued in the future through the Annual
                        Review process.</p>

                        Netherlands. Their eventual agreement to bringing in Greece and Turkey was
                        obtained without unduly straining internal <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                        for the first time Council meetings were attended by the Foreign, Defense
                        and Finance Ministers of each country. Although Council meetings as a result
                        became somewhat large and unwieldy, this disadvantage was more than
                        compensated for by the fact that Council decisions received broad support
                        from key ministries within each government. The major reorganization plans
                        agreed at Lisbon should further strengthen <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss>, provided they work out in practice. Centralization of
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> headquarters should improve
                        general efficiency. Creation of a high-level Permanent Council is designed
                        to enhance <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s ability to reach
                        important decisions. Creation of an International Staff and a permanent

                        strong feeling among the European members that more should be done in this

                        firm goals for the build-up of their ground, naval and air forces through
                        December 31, 1952. Provisional and planning goals were established for the
                        periods through calendar 1953 and 1954, respectively. The goals were stated
                        in terms of combat-ready forces, and stiff criteria were established as to
                        the standards of <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0560"/>readiness to be
                        used in measuring the extent to which force commitments were being met.
                        These standards measure units against a required combat-readiness on M Day
                        for air units; and at stated periods ranging from M to M+30 days for Army
                        units, and from M to M+180 days for naval units.</p>
                    <p>Although less than 5 months have elapsed since the Lisbon meetings, the
                        current status and the current rate of build-up of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> forces provides some basis for estimating the probability
                        of attaining the Lisbon goals for December 31, 1952. The prospects of
                        meeting these goals are discussed below separately for ground, naval and air
                        forces. Generally, in cases where shortfalls in ground forces are predicted
                        as of December 31, 1952, the units required to meet force goals will be
                        actually in existence but will not yet meet the required readiness
                        standards.</p>
                    <p>Estimates are based on information and judgments provided by the Military
                        Assistance Advisory Groups in each of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> countries, as revised and analyzed by JAMAG. The
                        Department of Defense is engaged in a comprehensive analysis of the status
                        of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces as of December 31, 1952 in
                        connection with the development of the U.S. position for the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Annual Review. The results of this study
                        should be available shortly as supplementary data.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">b</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Ground Forces.</hi> On June 30,
                        1952, European <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries (i.e., <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries excluding Greece, Turkey, the
                        U.S. and Canada) had available for commitment by SACEUR 22 M–through–M+30
                        divisions. By December 31, 1952 it is estimated that these countries will
                        have available 28⅔ divisions or about ⅔ of their Lisbon goals of 43⅔
                            divisions;<note n="†" xml:id="d162fn-sym5">Excludes two British reserve
                            divisions available at M+60 and M+90 which were included in Lisbon M+30
                            goals for accounting purposes only. [Footnote in the source
                            text.]</note> with an additional 16⅔ divisions available on an M+30+
                        basis in varying degrees of readiness. The anticipated shortfall of 15
                        divisions is due to failures to provide active-duty personnel, training, and
                        (to a lesser degree) equipment sufficient to bring the units up to the
                        required standards.</p>
                    <p>Substantial agreement between anticipated performance by December 31, 1952
                        and the Lisbon goals is indicated for divisions in readiness categories
                        through M+3. However, a shortfall of almost 50% of units at M+15 to M+30
                        standards of readiness is expected. These are the forces designated to
                        augment and back up the covering force of M-Day and M+3 which will have to
                        bear the initial brunt of any aggression in Western Europe. In view of the
                        fact that the Lisbon goals are admittedly militarily inadequate, the
                        expected <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0561"/>shortfall in augmenting
                        these covering forces means serious impairment of SACEUR’s ability at the
                        end of the current year to contain an enemy attack for more than a very
                        limited period.</p>
                    <p>It should be emphasized that these estimates with respect to the number of
                        effective divisions through M+30 take no account of the adequacy of combat
                        and logistic support or of wartime reserves. Both elements are admittedly
                        inadequate or on an extremely austere basis, a situation which inevitably
                        sets serious limitations on the ability of combat ready units to sustain
                        operations for an extended period. For purposes of analysis, however, these
                        problems are separable from the question of the adequacy of organic combat
                        divisions in terms of trained personnel and equipment, which were the only
                        readiness criteria established at Lisbon for major combat units.</p>

                        status, and anticipated December 31, 1952 status of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> ground forces, by type of division and by readiness
                        category. Figures are only for divisions to be contributed by European
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries. Seven and two-thirds
                        U.S. and Canadian divisions are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> included.
                        Addition of these .7⅔ divisions to the 43⅔ divisions indicated in the table
                        would give approximately the 50 divisions which constitute the popularly
                        known Lisbon goals.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">c</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Naval Forces</hi>. As of June
                        1952, the only substantial present and prospective shortfalls in meeting
                        Lisbon goals for December 31, 1952, for naval units related to escorts,
                        minesweepers (AM and AMI) and submarines. Between June 30 and December 31,
                        some closing of the gap for ocean minesweepers available by M+180 is
                        indicated, as well as a small increase in available inshore minesweepers at
                        M+180.</p>
                    <p>The expected shortfall in inshore minesweepers at M+180 is appreciable
                        (approximately 25% of the Lisbon goal) and stems primarily from the French
                        decision to eliminate, as impracticable and unsatisfactory, 31 fishing boats
                        previously scheduled for conversion to fill their M+180 commitment for that
                        type of vessel. With the exception of these inshore minesweepers, it appears
                        probable that the Lisbon 1952 naval force goals will be substantially met
                        and, in certain cases, exceeded. This general conclusion should be accepted,
                        nevertheless, with certain reservations with respect to special conditions
                        in specific countries.</p>
                    <p>Total shipments as of June 30 were $340 million out of a cumulative program
                        of $1,200 million, or about 28% in dollar value. Table <pb n="536"

                    <p>As far as is known, delays through December 31, 1952 in delivery of items in

                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> shortfalls in meeting Lisbon goals
                        will have occurred only in the case of 6 <gloss target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss>’s
                        for Denmark and the Netherlands, and sonar equipment for Portuguese patrol

                    <p><hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Air Forces</hi>. The number of
                        effective front-line aircraft available as of June 30 was more than ⅓ below
                        the December 31, 1952 Lisbon goals. By December 31, this shortfall is
                        expected to be reduced to somewhat less than 6%. The shortfall, however,
                        appears concentrated in the critical categories of interceptors and
                        fighter-bombers and amounts to nearly 16% of the Lisbon goal for Interceptor
                        Day Fighters-Fighter Bombers (IDF/FB). The situation in summary is as

                    <p>Actually the above table exaggerates the shortfall (185) in the IDF/FB
                        category, at least in so far as the mere <hi rend="italic">number</hi> of
                        aircraft available is concerned. At least 94 of this shortfall will be on
                        hand in Denmark. It is the lack of unit training in this case which
                        precludes their being included as <hi rend="italic">effective</hi>
                        front-line aircraft. On the other hand, a rigorous application of readiness
                        standards would probably reduce further the figures on effective front-line
                        aircraft from those given in the above table. There is evidence, for
                        instance, that inadequate pilot training and unit training, lack of
                        organizational equipment, and even failure to approximate authorized

                        countries. The above figures must therefore be regarded as upper limits on
                        the probable number of effective front-line aircraft which European <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries will be able to contribute by
                        December next towards meeting their 1952 Lisbon commitments.</p>
                    <p>It should further be emphasized that, in estimating the number of effective
                        aircraft to be available by December 31, 1952, no allowance was made for
                        requirements for combat reserve aircraft. Such reserves are, of course,
                        virtually non-existent except for the U.K. The present estimates of
                        front-line aircraft refer, therefore, to units in what has frequently and
                        appropriately been dubbed a “one-time” air force. This fact should not be
                        overlooked in appraising the considerable progress which it is anticipated
                        will be made by December 1952 towards meeting the Lisbon goals.</p>
                    <p>Total shipments as of June 30 were valued at $300 million, 13% of cumulative

                        remaining shortage in peacetime attrition aircraft will have been eliminated
                        by June 30, 1953.</p>

                    <p>Throughout fiscal year 1952 several continuing major problems were
                        encountered in administering the Mutual Security Program. First, every
                        possible support had to be given to the military buildup. Second, there had
                        to be taken into consideration the fact that the build-up was imposing a
                        heavy economic burden on countries that were just emerging from war and
                        postwar economic and political disruptions, and were vulnerable to drastic
                        economic dislocations. Third, it had to be recognized that while the
                        build-up required <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0564"/>an immediate
                        economic and military effort, further effort would be required to maintain
                        the forces after the higher levels had been reached. The force in being
                        after 1955 would continue to impose a heavy economic load on the European
                        countries, and if they were to carry this load their economies would have to
                        be further strengthened. Fourth, the program had to safeguard and continue
                        to promote the long-term aims of U.S. foreign policy in Europe which began
                        with the Marshall Plan.</p>
                    <p>The long-term objectives are solvency—ability to meet the required import
                        level without extraordinary U.S. aid—and the progressive unification of
                        Western Europe. Concurrently with the promotion of these specific aims the
                        program had to consider the desires of the European people for a rising
                        living standard and their reasonable hope that Western Europe would at some
                        early date achieve sufficient economic strength to tackle some of its most
                        pressing social and economic problems, among them the continued large
                        structural unemployment in Western Germany and in Italy; the
                        under-development of Greece, Turkey and Southern Italy; and the persistence
                        of large Communist parties in Italy and France.</p>

                        rearmament effort, further progress has been made in expanding Western
                        European trade and production. Coal and steel production, agricultural
                        output, and the foreign trade of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        and associated countries all rose to new postwar highs, and most of them
                        were well above prewar.</p>
                    <p>The most spectacular advances were made in steel and electricity production.

                            >NATO</gloss> countries and Germany, which had begun to exceed 1938
                        levels as early as 1949, continued to grow from 48.3 million metric tons in
                        1950 to 53.6 million tons in 1951, and electricity output rose from 192
                        billion KWH in 1950 to 214 billion KWH in 1951, thus more than doubling
                        prewar production. Motor vehicle output showed only a slight increase during
                        the year under review, but with 1.5 million units produced, stood almost
                        two-thirds higher than prewar. The combined industrial index for the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries and Germany rose from 135% of
                        1938 to 144% during the year reviewed.</p>
                    <p>Significant advances were also made in coal production. Output for the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries as a whole grew from 338
                        million tons in 1950 to 342 million tons in 1951, for the first time
                        exceeding 1938 production. Germany also increased its coal output by 7.6
                        million tons to 118.8 million tons, but production was still considerably
                        below the 136 million tons mined in the Ruhr area in 1938. Total coal
                        production for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> plus Germany amounted
                        to 460.6 million tons, still about 14 million tons short of 1938 levels.</p>
                    <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0565"/>
                    <p>Substantial increases were also scored in agricultural production. Output of
                        milk, meats, fats and oils, and bread grains all rose, raising the index of
                        gross agricultural production for the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>
                        countries from 103% of 1938 in fiscal 1950 to an estimated 112% in fiscal
                        1952. Foreign trade of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries
                        and Germany increased sharply from a monthly average of $1.4 billion in 1950
                        to close to $2 billion in 1951.</p>
                    <p>The continuous growth of Western Europe’s economic base had an important
                        politically stabilizing effect. It proved that a measure of rearmament could
                        be carried on while still expanding the economy as a whole. Most important
                        of all, the continuous economic expansion made it possible for most of the
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries to carry the armament
                        burden without serious inroads on the living standards of their people. In
                        most of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries standards of
                        living—admittedly lower than desirable—continued to improve somewhat,
                        although at a far lower rate than before the Korean war. A notable exception
                        is the United Kingdom where living standards declined slightly.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">b. Balance of Payments</hi>. The year was marked by serious
                        balance-of-payments crises in the two principal <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> countries. France lost $100 million in reserves, and the
                        U.K. lost $2 billion in gold and dollars. The weakness of the French and
                        British gold and dollar reserves has been an important factor in the
                        stretch-out of the armament program of these countries. Most of the other
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and associated countries ended the
                        year with reserves that were equal to or slightly higher than the reserves
                        in the preceding year.</p>
                    <p>The gold and dollar drain experienced by France and the United Kingdom was
                        closely related to the violent fluctuations in the prices of commodities
                        that have marked the post-Korean period. In the immediate months following
                        the outbreak of the Korean war, rubber and the coarser wools rose to three
                        times the price they had commanded in early 1950. Other fibers and the
                        non-ferrous metals, especially tin, also showed remarkable increases. As a
                        result, the sterling area, a large exporter of these commodities, was able
                        to raise its gold and dollar holdings from $2.4 billion in June 1950 to $3.9
                        billion in June 1951. The period of large reserves, however, was
                        short-lived. The drain began when the United Kingdom, which had consumed its
                        inventories in the hope of price break, had to replenish its stocks of raw
                        materials, while the other members of the sterling area, cashing in on their
                        earlier gains, raised the level of their imports from the dollar area. By
                        December 1951 sterling area reserves had fallen to $2.3 billion and by March
                        they had decreased to $1.7 billion, remaining at that level through June 30.
                            <gloss target="#t_EPU1">EPU</gloss> gold and dollar settlements
                        accounted for over $400 million of this loss in reserves.</p>
                    <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0566"/>
                    <p>In the case of France the generally higher cost of imports was aggravated by
                        political and budgetary uncertainties which induced a flight from the franc.
                        The result was that France, which had held a net creditor position in the
                        European Payments Union in early 1951, not only became a net debtor in 1952
                        but was required to make gold and dollar settlements of $130 million during
                        the fiscal year. With the prospect of somewhat greater financial stability,
                        France’s balance-of-payments position has improved in recent months.
                        France’s trade deficit narrowed in the second quarter. Furthermore, the gold
                        loan of the Pinay government appears to have resulted in substantial
                        additions to French gold reserves.</p>

                            Production</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Countries in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area increased their
                        total defense expenditures from $6.2 billion in fiscal 1951 to $8.8 billion
                        in fiscal 1952. The U.S. agencies concerned believe that, by and large,
                        assuming no major change in the degree of international tensions, and
                        leaving aside increments in defense expenditure which may be expected to
                        accompany further expansion of total production, the current orders of
                        magnitude of European defense expenditures are as high as can be
                        supported.</p>
                    <p>Expenditures by the Federal Republic of Germany were for the most part
                        associated with occupation costs and remained at about the same level as in
                        fiscal 1951. Despite the encouraging overall progress in increasing <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> outlays for defense, expenditures made by
                        France, the U.K. and Italy fell short to some extent of the levels which
                        U.S. Mutual Security agencies had hoped might result from the TCC review.
                        The major area in which expenditures were lower than had been hoped for was
                        in the field of defense budget outlays for procurement of major
                        matériel.</p>
                    <p>Major matériel expenditures did, nevertheless, rise almost $900 million above
                        fiscal 1951 levels, accounting for 35% of the total increase in defense
                        budgets. In the case of France, budgetary restrictions made it necessary for
                        the U.S. to take over (through the offshore procurement device) the
                        financing of a substantial number of matériel procurement contracts which
                        had previously been entered into by the French Government. As the fiscal
                        year closed the French were making a strong plea to the U.S. for further
                        budgetary relief of this nature. The fact that funds available during fiscal
                        1953 are not adequate to meet the full French request will mean some further
                        curtailment of their defense production plans in the future.</p>
                    <p>The U.K. recently took a governmental decision to stretch out the timing of
                        its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense build-up. While fiscal
                        1952 matériel expenditures were not appreciably affected, defense production
                            <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0567"/>levels in fiscal 1953 will have
                        to be decreased unless off-shore procurement financing can be provided. As
                        to Italy, the Government has shown continuing reluctance to increase the
                        overall level of defense expenditures, and has particularly been unwilling
                        to accede to U.S. proposals that expenditures for major matériel procurement
                        be substantially increased.</p>
                    <p>Outside the field of major matériel procurement, it is difficult to evaluate
                        to what degree limitations in defense expenditures have been a factor in
                        delaying the build-up of forces. It appears clear that in certain cases
                        increased defense budgets might have permitted faster progress to have been
                        made in raising and training forces.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the Lisbon conference, each country adopted a revised
                        defense expenditure plan calculated to support the agreed force build-up.
                        These defense budget plans were stated in response to suggestions emanating
                        from the TCC review as to desirable levels of defense expenditures for each
                        country. The fact that neither the expenditure levels originally suggested
                        by TCC nor those eventually adopted by the countries have been reviewed by
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> or by the U.S. Government to
                        determine their adequacy to support the Lisbon goals, makes it difficult to
                        establish any meaningful bench-marks against which to measure country
                        defense expenditures. However, since both the TCC Executive Bureau
                        “desirable levels” and the individual defense expenditure plans of the
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries have been frequently

                    <p><hi rend="italic">a. Defense Production</hi>. In general, the activities of
                        defense production in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> areas, up to
                        June 30, proceeded at a less rapid pace than had been estimated as possible
                        during the course of the TCC exercise. To some extent, no doubt, shortfalls
                        were the result of administrative red-tape, of the difficulties encountered
                        in conversion and tooling up, and of technical bottlenecks arising from
                        shortages of machine tools, manpower, and critical materials. In its major
                        outlines, however, the failure of European defense production to reach the
                        levels that had been hoped for by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
                        by the U.S. Government was attributable to two main factors: (1) failure of
                        the European governments to provide in their defense budgets adequate
                        financing for major matériel procurement; and (2) delay recognition, by the
                        U.S. Government and by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, of the crucial
                        contribution that could be made to the collective effort by large-scale
                        off-shore procurement by the U.S.</p>
                    <p>Both in France and Italy, “politico-economic” considerations resulted in
                        major delays in government placement of firm defense contracts, and in
                        substantial downward adjustments in the originally hoped-for programs. These
                        two countries together received about two-thirds of the total of $450
                        million “regular” off-shore procurement contracts placed by the U.S. in
                        Europe during fiscal 1952. In addition French contracts for matériel in the
                        amount of about $180 million were taken on under the so-called “Lisbon
                        commitment” type of off-shore procurement. The fact that the regular
                        offshore procurement contracts were not placed in any volume until the last
                        quarter of the fiscal year, together with inadequate budgetary provisions
                        for major matériel procurement, resulted in a <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543"
                            facs="0569"/>marked under-utilization of defense production capacity in
                        these two countries during fiscal 1952.</p>
                    <p>In the U.K., financial stringencies have not so far played such a major role
                        as in France and Italy in accounting for lagging defense production. Tooling
                        up delays, and shortages of manpower, critical materials, and machine tools,
                        all of which had to be diverted from industries turning out peacetime goods
                        for export, are seen as the major reasons for the shortfalls experienced to
                        date. The “stretchout” for the balance of the program is, however, prompted
                        basically by financial considerations, both as regards budgetary outlays and
                        as regards protecting from further depletion Britain’s hard currency
                        reserves. That a certain amount of physical capacity is available, given the
                        existence of financial underwriting—and particularly, given the promise of
                        dollar payments to compensate for the loss of foreign exchange when capacity
                        is shifted from production for export—is evidenced by the fact that the U.S.
                        has recently been able to place off-shore procurement contracts in the
                        amount of $65 million for tanks, ammunition, and electronic equipment.</p>
                    <p>Now that the off-shore procurement program is getting under way on a large
                        scale, the U.S. and the European <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        countries are faced with major policy decisions relating to the
                        establishment of a rational pattern of European production. Among the many
                        factors which must be considered are: (1) comparative cost of U.S. and
                        European output, (2) need to fill gaps in material availability caused by
                        U.S. production shortfalls, (3) strategic necessity of having a nearby
                        source of supply for expendable items such as ammunition and spare parts,
                        and (4) long-range European production needs for maintenance of military
                        equipment.</p>
                    <p>The problem of developing European production of ammunition is one of the
                        most pressing at this time. Also in an advanced stage of planning and
                        negotiation is a substantial program for the production of fighter aircraft.
                        Combat and transport vehicles, electronics, and smaller naval craft are
                        among the other important fields where production is either planned or is
                        already activated for offshore procurement.</p>

                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Internal and External Security</hi>. With the notable
                        exception of Egypt and Iran, the governments of countries receiving U.S.
                        assistance in the Near East and Africa displayed a considerable degree of
                        stability during fiscal year 1952—a stability which is the more noteworthy
                        because of the widespread tensions in the area. In the face of a heightened
                        nationalism throughout many of these countries, which the Communists have
                        made every effort to exploit, the <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0570"
                        />orientation of their governments remained anti-Communist and friendly to
                        the West.</p>
                    <p>No state in the area appeared to offer any serious threat to the immediate
                        security of any other state at the end of June 1952. Although Iraq still
                        refused to recognize Syria’s new military government, the danger of overt
                        interference has subsided. The smouldering threat of a “second round” of
                        Arab attack on Israel seems to have lost its force as it has become apparent
                        that no conceivable coalition of Arab states could defeat the Israeli
                        forces. The only serious possibility of danger from external sources
                        remained that of the U.S.S.R.</p>
                    <p>Turkey continued to be one of the strongest and most stable governments in
                        the area, and Greece demonstrated some evidence of progress toward political
                        stability. In neither country is Communism considered to be a serious
                        threat: Communism has been embraced by less than 1/10 of 1% of the
                        population in Turkey. Recent elections in Greece showed less than 10% of the
                        votes cast for the extreme left-wing parties. In these elections, the
                        extreme left-wing, considered to be covertly Communist controlled, failed to
                        increase its strength over the 1950 returns. There continues to be evidence
                        of Communist activity in moderate left-wing groups and labor unions as well
                        as in distressed tobacco areas in Thrace and Macedonia.</p>
                    <p>The long standing distrust which has separated the Greeks, Turks and
                        Yugoslavs has subsided. Greece and Turkey, both before and since their
                        admission to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, have enjoyed
                        increasingly friendly relations, and the two countries have agreed to a
                        considerable exchange of military information. Both have made efforts to
                        improve generally their relations with Yugoslavia. Yugoslav military leaders
                        have indicated a willingness to engage in military staff talks with Greece
                        and Turkey. It is hoped that such a move would eventually lead to
                        coordinated defense efforts. Greece is now considering revival of a prewar
                        arrangement under which an area in the Port of Salonika is reserved as a
                        free port for Yugoslav use.</p>
                    <p>Internal security threats have been held in check in most countries. The
                        glaring exceptions are, of course, Iran and Egypt. It is still too early to
                        predict the course to be followed by Premier Mossadeq, who now has virtually
                        unlimited power in Iran, or by Egypt’s military coup regime headed by
                        General Naguib. There is nothing to indicate any tendency on the part of
                        either leader to look to the East, although in Iran there is some evidence
                        that a working agreement between the Tudeh (Communist) Party and some
                        extreme elements of the National Front existed during the anti-Qavam riots.
                        It is possible that the Tudeh Party in Iran may <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545"
                            facs="0571"/>be the ultimate victor if Mossadeq’s somewhat different
                        concepts of economic planning prove faulty.</p>
                    <p>In Egypt, however, immediate steps were taken by the authorities to ensure
                        that there would be no recurrence of the January 26 riots and burning of
                        Cairo. The drive against the already outlawed Communist Party has been
                        intensified; the Communist Party in Egypt, unlike the Tudeh Party in Iran,
                        is badly organized and lacking in indigenous leadership. Recent reforms in
                        the economic situation and those contemplated in land distribution will
                        probably further decrease strength of the Communists and will certainly
                        dilute the effect of their propaganda.</p>
                    <p>Assassinations of Jordan’s Abdullah and Pakistan’s Liaquat Ali Khan removed
                        strongly pro-Western leaders and for a time threatened internal security in
                        the two countries. New leaders lack the ability of their predecessors, but
                        have maintained their Western affiliations.</p>
                    <p>Following Colonel Shishikli’s military coup of November 1951, Syria appears
                        to have the most stable government in its seven year history as an
                        independent republic. Although its leaders are in many ways nearer to a
                        pro-Western attitude than other Arab countries, they still have not
                        concluded negotiations for a Point 4 general agreement, for <gloss
                            target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> loans, or for Arab refugee resettlement
                        projects.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Attitude Toward Collective Defense</hi>. Of the 14
                        countries in the Near East and African area, only two—Greece and Turkey—are
                        participating in an effective collective defense arrangement. Both are
                        strong supporters of the principle of collective defense and have cooperated

                        Both provided combat troops in Korea, with full popular support. Both have
                        acceded to the North Atlantic Treaty and have thus become full-fledged

                    <p>The only other collective defensive arrangement in the area is the Arab
                        League Collective Security Pact, to which Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon,
                        Saudi Arabia, Syria and Yemen are all signatories. This “defense
                        arrangement” of Arab states is less likely to produce actual security than
                        to develop a bargaining position for Western defense proposals.
                        Significantly, three of the first four countries to ratify the pact (Egypt,
                        Iraq, Syria) have already expressed considerable interest in joining the
                        proposed Middle East Defense Organization (<gloss target="#t_MEDO1"

                    <p>Greece was just recently admitted to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.
                        Lisbon Force Goals were not established for 1952; so program objectives are
                        in terms of <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>-approved forces. From the
                        manpower point of view, the Greek Armed Forces are capable of raising and
                        maintaining the forces approved by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                        >JCS</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The size of the Greek National Army meets the approved <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> force goals with the exception of a
                        shortfall of 2 light infantry regiments. There has been no change in the
                        size of the Greek Army. The arrival of arms and equipment, however, have
                        greatly increased its effectiveness. The Greek Army as a whole is considered
                        well led, satisfactorily trained and, except for some matériel deficiencies,
                        prepared to carry out its wartime mission.</p>
                    <p>The Greek Navy is organized in accordance with the approved <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> force goals. The training vessels and
                        equipment received in the past year have increased the effectiveness of the
                        Greek Navy by approximately 30%.</p>
                    <p>The strength of the Greek Air Force has remained unchanged. Aircraft and
                        supporting equipment to complete the build-up of the air force were
                        programmed in the <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 budget. This <pb n="547"
                            xml:id="pg_547" facs="0573"/>force is not considered sufficient
                        adequately to defend Greece from the air, nor is it large enough to furnish
                        sufficient tactical air support to exploit the potential of the large Greek
                        National Army. However, it is the maximum force to which the Royal Hellenic
                        Air Force is considered capable of expanding by December 1953.</p>
                    <p>Since the advent of the Mutual Security Program, the Greek defense effort has
                        remained at the relatively high level established shortly after the outbreak
                        of the Korean war. The maintenance of this effort has required defense
                        expenditures of about $185 to $195 million per annum, or about 9% of the
                        gross national product and about 40% of total national budget expenditures.
                        This level of expenditures has provided for (a) the maintenance of about ten
                        divisions of land forces, support troops, and a smaller complement of sea
                        and air forces; (b) the requirements of the armed forces for food, clothing,
                        medical supplies, fuels, and other quartermaster items, as well as the
                        creation of reserves of similar items to meet additional requirements
                        related to the mobilization of trained reserves numbering some 300,000 men;
                        and (c) the construction of military highways, airfields, port facilities,
                        telecommunications, and other essential military installations.</p>
                    <p>The present size of the Greek Armed Forces appears adequate to enable Greece
                        to fulfill its task within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and no
                        significant expansion in the Greek defense effort is now contemplated. The
                        goal of the Greek defense effort is qualitative, calling for the continued
                        improvement of the military effectiveness of the existing forces. In fact,
                        the Greek Government has expressed its intention of reducing military
                        expenditures by as much as 10% but has stated that this reduction will be
                        effected without impairing either the size or effectiveness of the defense
                        establishment.</p>

                    <p>In view of Turkey’s recent admission to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                        >NATO</gloss>, no Lisbon Force Goals were established for Turkey in 1952.
                        However, Turkey’s Armed Forces already exceed <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss> goals by about 19%. Present plans do not call for an
                        increase in numerical strength over the present 386,000. Nor will the number
                        of existing units be expanded. Continued modernization, however, will
                        proceed during and after 1952 through programmed shipments of transport
                        equipment, artillery, etc., for the Army, modern submarines for the Navy,
                        and the transition of the Air Force into jets. The main build-up will be in
                        the increased efficiency of existing forces in the field of training and in
                        the arrival of programmed equipment.</p>
                    <p>The Turkish Army is trained and organized to defend Turkey from aggression by
                        nations which border on Turkey. Therefore, in evaluating the combat
                        potential of the Turkish Army, it is not possible to compare the Turkish
                        divisions and brigades with similar units of the U.S. Army fully prepared
                        for overseas movement. It is felt, nevertheless, that the Turkish
                        organizations are sound and that they can successfully defend the areas to
                        which they have been assigned against the types of units which may be
                        employed against them by Russia and/or Bulgaria, unless they are
                        overwhelmingly out-numbered. The major matériel deficiencies of the Turkish
                        Army consist chiefly of: (a) unit equipment, (b) spare parts and
                        replacements, including annual operating requirements and combat reserves,
                        and (c) training ammunition and combat reserve ammunition. Unit equipment
                        deficiencies include artillery, engineering, motor transport, signal,
                        mechanized, and miscellaneous small arms. <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1952 and the proposed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 programs cover
                        these matériel deficiencies.</p>
                    <p>In the Turkish Navy the major equipment deficiencies are vessels (new
                        replacements and modernization), vessel equipment, electronics equipment,
                        ordnance equipment and supplies, rockets, ammunition, and engineering
                        equipment and supplies. There are also inadequate naval bases and logistic
                        bases, anti-submarine and anti-torpedo nets, shipyards, and underground
                            <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> storage facilities. All these
                        deficiencies are due for correction in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1953 Aid Program and Turkish plans.</p>
                    <p>The major deficiency of the Turkish Air Force is that it is not yet equipped
                        with modern aircraft to act as a real deterrent to an aggressor. Modern jet
                        fighter-bomber aircraft are programmed for the planned forces of the Turkish
                        Air Force to the extent that they can be efficiently utilized. The delivery
                        of this type aircraft has just started and will continue through <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953. If all programmed equipment is approved
                        and delivered, it will complete the initial equipping of a Turkish Air Force
                        of 15 squadrons.</p>

                    <p>The main task of the <hi rend="italic">Gendarmérie</hi>—an organized,

                        officers and men are given mobilization assignments. The Turkish Armed

                        retain the knowledge acquired during his required active duty tour of

                    <p>Turkey lacks manufacturing facilities to sustain herself independently in a

                        successful all-out aggression. In regard to the economic capacity of the
                        Turks to maintain present forces, unless there is great improvement in the
                        Turkish economic situation, continued aid will be necessary for operational
                        and maintenance purposes over and above that which Turkey’s 500 million lira
                        annual budget will support.</p>

                    <p>The development of a first-class fighting force in Iran with a reasonable
                        degree of self-sufficiency is a long-term project requiring basic reform.
                        One of the most serious deficiencies in the Iranian forces is the poor
                        quality of its leadership. Corruption and lack of integrity are widespread
                        and contribute significantly to the inefficiency of the Army. Much
                        procrastination, little supervision and casual compliance with orders are
                        significant characteristics. Better command techniques may be obtained as
                        younger, better trained officers reach key positions. However, there is
                        little delegation of any important authority, probably because of danger of
                        a coup.</p>
                    <p>The strength of the Army—132,500—is 5% above <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss> approved force goals. However, this strength is spread over
                        two infantry divisions and 4 infantry brigades in addition to <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> force goals. Equipment is generally
                        adequate considering the state of training and ability to absorb. Present
                        level of equipment is approximately 35% of planned minimum. Deficiencies
                        include inadequate leadership, planning, training and logistical support. It
                        is estimated that the Army could be logistically supported in combat for
                        only two weeks. The Army is considered to be sufficiently effective to
                        maintain internal order.</p>
                    <p>The Navy strength is within 5% of <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                        approved force goals. Equipment is generally adequate except for repair
                        facilities. The Iranian Navy has virtually no combat capabilities in view of
                        obsolescent equipment and limited size of naval forces. It has limited
                        capabilities for assistance in internal security operations.</p>
                    <p>The Air Force is within 1% of approved <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                        force strength but is not organized in accordance with <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> force goals. The level of equipment is
                        generally adequate except for training aircraft. The Iranian Air Force has
                        no combat capabilities. It suffers from the <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551"
                            facs="0577"/>overall deficiency of the Army, aggravated by the technical
                        requirements of aviation.</p>
                    <p>The Iranian <hi rend="italic">Gendarmérie</hi> is not part of the peacetime
                        military establishment. Dispersed in small squad posts and functioning in
                        non-municipal and non-tribal areas, it lacks communications and
                        transportation. It has no capacity other than day-to-day police functions,
                        little flexibility and practically no reserves. Morale is somewhat better
                        than in the Army because the <hi rend="italic">Gendarmérie</hi> has no
                        conscripts and there is relatively better pay and opportunity for graft.</p>

                        the Government of the Philippines were the most stable in the entire Far
                        Eastern area. There was no internal challenge in Formosa to either Chiang
                        Kai-shek or the Kuomintang. The strength of the present Philippine
                        Government was somewhat impaired by the victory of the opposition party in
                        the 1951 elections. But the cause of good government as well as the
                        stability of the government was considerably furthered because the elections
                        were on the whole conducted honestly and with a minimum of violence, in
                        contrast to previous elections.</p>
                    <p>The coalition Government of Burma achieved a resounding victory by being
                        reelected by a substantial margin of the popular vote. This clear mandate
                        from the people strengthened the hand of the government and encouraged it to
                        form a more effective cabinet with a more positive attitude toward solving
                        the problems confronting it. It is significant to point out that the
                        government’s endorsement of American economic assistance was an important
                        issue in the elections.</p>
                    <p>The Associated States of Indochina made significant progress in assuming the
                        responsibilities of self-government within the past year. The government
                        which had been in power for the past two years in Viet-Nam was replaced by a
                        new and stronger government in June 1952. A major part in this change was
                        played by Emperor Bao Dai and is believed to reflect an increasing
                        determination on his part to stabilize the government and improve its
                        effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>Thailand has had a recent history of governmental change by coup rather than
                        by parliamentary process. Two such coups were attempted in the past year,
                        both of which were engineered within the government itself to consolidate
                        the power of the military leaders. This seeming governmental instability,
                        coupled with the highhandedness and corruption of the governing group, has
                        been a matter of serious concern to the United States Government. There <pb
                            n="552" xml:id="pg_552" facs="0578"/>is no reason to believe, however,
                        that the present control of the governing group will be disturbed in the
                        near future.</p>
                    <p>In Indonesia the government which had given assurances to the United States
                        acceptable under Section 511(a) of the Mutual Security Act was ousted in
                        February, 1952 and was succeeded, after a difficult formation period, by a
                        government which was an uneasy coalition. This government has not yet, after
                        a number of months, been accorded a clear vote of confidence by the
                        parliament. Instead, the parliament has voted the government an “opportunity
                        to work.”</p>
                    <p>Food shortages and economic difficulties continued to offer the greatest
                        danger to the internal security of existing governments in India and
                        Pakistan, where they are exploited by the Communists. Communist strength was
                        significantly disclosed in India, where Communist-supported candidates drew
                        over 6,000,000 votes in the recent general elections, although the party
                        itself claimed only 30,000 dues-paying members prior to the election.
                        Twenty-seven Communists and Communist sympathizers were elected to the House
                        of the People (total seats—497). The Communists won large blocs of seats in
                        several of the state assemblies. While not by themselves sufficiently strong
                        to be able to form a government in any state, the Communists emerged from
                        the general election with the largest number of elected representatives in
                        opposition to the Congress Party, although the Socialists actually polled
                        twice as many popular votes. The Congress Party drew only 45% of the total
                        votes while winning 74% of the seats in the House of the People. It is
                        possible that the disclosure of Communist Party strength within India has
                        had some effect on the Government’s attitude toward international communism.
                        While India is still unwilling to become directly involved in the cold war
                        or openly to take the part of the West, the Indian Government has shown
                        signs of apprehension regarding the intentions of Red China, and has
                        recently taken steps to strengthen its defenses along the Chinese and
                        Tibetan borders.</p>
                    <p>In Nepal the quarrels of the Congress Party leaders and a series of minor
                        outbreaks of violence kept the country in a turmoil which was exploited by
                        the Communists.</p>
                    <p>Turning from the question of governmental stability in terms of
                        constitutional change to the question of overthrow by force, most
                        governments in the area were in the shadow of serious threats throughout
                        most of the period. In Indochina active warfare was waged during the entire
                        year to regain and consolidate control in areas which had been taken over by
                        the Viet Minh. With French financial subsidies and military effort, coupled
                        with U.S. arms aid, the governments of the Associated States were able to
                        retain their control over large portions of the area. The Vietnamese
                        Government <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0579"/>has also been
                        increasingly successful in maintaining and extending its political control.
                        Although there has been no overt invasion from Communist China, the military
                        capability of the opposing Viet Minh forces has been increased significantly
                        through arms assistance and technical support and advice from the Chinese
                        Communists.</p>
                    <p>Burma has long been the scene of a number of concurrent insurrections. The
                        outstanding effect of the government’s victory in the elections was the
                        adoption of a more aggressive attitude toward the insurgents, including
                        considerably more effective efforts against the Communist insurgents, with a
                        corresponding decrease in the attention given to the non-Communist Karen
                        rebels. The government’s forces have prevented the insurgents from improving
                        their position and have succeeded in driving them from some parts of the
                        country which they held for several years.</p>
                    <p>Indonesia has been in little danger of external invasion, but it has been the
                        scene of widespread dissident action, particularly by a fanatic Muslim group
                        operating in Central and West Java. It is estimated that there are a total
                        of approximately 128,000 dissidents in the country, of whom 70,000 may be
                        armed. The Communist Hukbalahap movement in the Philippines was broken
                        during the past year and is no longer considered to be a major threat to the
                        stability of the government. While Thailand has a large number of Chinese
                        residents, it is nevertheless relatively free from any threat of organized
                        Communist dissidents. Total Communist strength is not believed to exceed
                        20,000 members and sympathizers.</p>
                    <p>In considering the security of governments in this area there is always, of
                        course, the ever-present twin danger faced by the Nationalist Government of
                        China on Formosa, in the form of the threat of an all-out military assault
                        by the Chinese Communists from the mainland and the economic difficulties
                        arising from the maintenance of disproportionately large armed forces needed
                        to meet an invasion from the mainland.</p>
                    <p>Pakistan and India appear no nearer to a solution of the long-festering
                        Kashmir problem; and Afghanistan continues the bitter quarrel with Pakistan
                        over the “Pushtoonistan” issue.</p>

                        Most of the Latin American governments appear to be relatively secure at the
                        conclusion of the period under review. Political stability and continuity
                            <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0583"/>of governments are at least
                        superficially no worse than they have generally been in the past.
                        Nevertheless, the past year has witnessed unconstitutional seizures of
                        governmental power in Cuba and Bolivia. The ability of the
                        constitutionally-elected governments in Chile and Ecuador to maintain
                        themselves in control hung at times in precarious balance. In other
                        countries, such as Colombia and Venezuela, those in control were preoccupied
                        with maintaining their power against actual or threatened violence. In still
                        other countries stability was the product of one-man or one-party rule which
                        tolerated no opposition.</p>
                    <p>Aside from the influence of Communism, there were no external threats to
                        political stability within the Hemisphere. Among the nations of Latin
                        America, none seriously threatened the security of any other.</p>
                    <p>Internal threats to political stability were apparent in several countries
                        due primarily to the unpopularity of governments with important groups
                        within their countries, economic difficulties, or a combination of the two.
                        The dissatisfaction of important elements was obvious in Argentina,
                        Colombia, Cuba and Guatemala. Economic difficulties were the most important
                        factor in Bolivia, Paraguay and Panama, and a strong contributory factor in
                        Argentina. In Brazil, the development of a strongly nationalist, if not
                        Communist-minded, group in the armed forces was brought under control
                        through effective action by the dominant faction of the military
                        leadership.</p>
                    <p>The repressive Peron administration maintained control of Argentina despite
                        an abortive revolt by a few military leaders. The demise of politically
                        powerful Eva Peron creates yet another crisis for the regime. In Colombia,
                        government control was firm only in urban centers. Violence and repressive
                        measures were frequent as the Conservative government tried to keep control
                        in the face of Liberal opposition and widespread civil disorder throughout
                        the provinces. In Cuba, the constitutionally-elected government of Prio
                        Socarras was overthrown by a military coup. The possibility of political
                        disturbances in Guatemala was increased by the enactment of a drastic land
                        reform law which continues the government’s attack on the interests of the
                        traditional ruling class.</p>
                    <p>Nationalist-leftist elements in Bolivia capitalized on difficult economic
                        conditions to overthrow the government after a bloody revolution. Continuing
                        hard times and moves of the new government toward nationalization of the
                        important tin industry create doubt that the revolutionary government will
                        be able to maintain itself. In Paraguay, seemingly insoluble economic
                        problems which have resulted in near bankruptcy and in severe food
                        shortages, would appear to endanger stability where it has been traditional.
                        In <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0584"/>Panama, growing unemployment
                        combined with home-grown and imported subversive influences to create an
                        atmosphere of political tension. National elections were conducted with a
                        minimum of disturbance, but the bases for unrest were by no means
                        eliminated.</p>
                    <p>Venezuela’s military <hi rend="italic">junta</hi> remained in power, though
                        without progress toward winning the loyalty of the majority of the people.
                        National elections in Mexico were held early in July 1952 with virtually no
                        disturbance, noteworthy evidence of progress toward political maturity. The
                        recent election in Ecuador was unexpectedly peaceful.</p>
                    <p>In summary, Latin America is passing through a period of far-reaching
                        political, social, and economic adjustment, which imposes upon most of the
                        governments a preoccupation with domestic problems. Furthermore, nationalist
                        and Communist groups seize every opportunity to provoke dissention in
                        existing political institutions and to undermine, by propaganda and violent
                        demonstrations, the foundations of genuine democratic development. These
                        groups are also seizing increasingly upon the wave of anti-colonialism which
                        is rising throughout the rest of the world, by associating the
                        underdevelopment of the area with the issue of colonialism and the so-called
                        economic imperialism of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Communist capabilities in Latin America have been enhanced by growing
                        stresses and strains in the life of these countries. Even where Communist
                        organization is relatively strong, however, its operations succeed only to
                        the extent that local favoring factors exist and strategy is adapted to
                        exploit these factors. Preferred targets of Communist penetration include
                        organized and unorganized labor, and certain white-collar and professional
                        groups. Extreme nationalists have been ready to make common cause with the
                        Communists in front groups that oppose cooperation with the United States on
                        the grounds of “infringement of sovereignty”. The Communist target groups,
                        largely urban, have grown in size and influence with the shift of population
                        from rural to urban areas.</p>
                    <p>Tensions are greatest in Argentina, Bolivia, and Guatemala, where socially
                        radical doctrine plays a leading part in the nationalist program and the
                        nationalists have teamed with mass elements in a potent political force. To
                        a lesser extent Chile, Ecuador, Venezuela, Panama and El Salvador are
                        experiencing similar stresses and strains. Communist influence still
                        persists in Mexico, although the new order brought about by revolution has
                        matured, the tensions have subsided somewhat and new vested interests are a
                        strong force for stability.</p>
                    <p>Communist capabilities are presently limited in those countries that are
                        still living in the traditional pattern of Latin American society. Extremist
                        forces have shown considerable strength in Brazil, <pb n="559"
                            xml:id="pg_559" facs="0585"/>where nationalists, even including some in
                        the military, have worked with Communists. They are, however, countered by
                        the power of propertied groups and by Brazil’s close association with the
                        United States. In other countries having a traditional or moderate political
                        order, nationalists have tended to ally with propertied interests or the
                        military and have steered clear of Communist association.</p>
                    <p>Communist party membership, which reached a 1947 peak of one-third of a
                        million in all Latin America, has declined to about 200,000. The important
                        Brazilian, Chilean, and Cuban parties, which had made a strong showing in
                        1944–47 national elections, have lost more than half their membership
                        strength, accounting for most of the decline in party membership. Official
                        proscription of the parties in many countries reduced vote totals of
                        Communist-supported candidates to a handful from the million registered in
                        1944–47 national elections in 9 republics. Communist participation in
                        national politics is now significant only in Guatemala and, to a lesser
                        extent, in Chile. The position of the Communists in these countries, while
                        impressive, results only to a limited degree from the strength of national
                        Communist organization. It derives in part from Communist influence in the
                        labor movement which, in Guatemala at least, has no effective political
                        counterbalance, and in part from Communist alignment with proponents of
                        civil liberties or extreme nationalism.</p>

                        governments thus favor collective defense in principle, the degree of active
                        and affirmative support varies widely. Attitudes and actions are affected by
                        such factors as preoccupation with pressing local problems; the ability of
                        nationalist and Communist political and propaganda activities to influence
                        governmental decisions; resentment that almost all of U.S. assistance in the
                        post-war years has been given to other areas; and the prevalent assumption
                        that the United States will continue to assume the burden of military
                        defense of <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0587"/>the Western Hemisphere.
                        Underlying these factors, however, is the fact that existing military
                        establishments are inadequately trained and equipped to engage in modern
                        collective military operations without additional U.S. assistance.</p>
                    <p>The military grant-aid negotiations carried on in 1952 were predicated on the
                        assumption that willingness to participate in a collective defense
                        arrangement was primarily limited by inability to achieve adequate material
                        preparation without U.S. aid. The essential immediate purpose of United
                        States assistance is to provide the missing component—i.e., the necessary
                        training and equipment to enable these countries to participate in planned
                        collective action in the event of war or emergency. It is noteworthy,
                        therefore, that of the 8 governments (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba,
                        Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay) with which negotiations were initiated,
                        the agreements required by policy and legislation have been signed with 7
                        and are in full effect with 5. Ratification of the Brazilian and Uruguayan
                        agreements remains to be completed. No difficulty is expected in the case of
                        Brazil, and the chances are not unfavorable in Uruguay. The Mexican talks,
                        while unproductive of an agreement, were concluded without prejudice to
                        possible future resumption. Although Argentina is militarily capable of
                        participating in the regional collective defense program, Peron’s policy
                        negates any expectation of Argentine cooperation in any collective military
                        action. No approach has been made to Argentina regarding Mutual Security
                        Program negotiations.</p>
                    <p>The Dominican Republic has not yet been approached regarding participation in
                        the military grant-aid program. It is expected, on the basis of its general
                        policies and its willingness to negotiate a Guided Missiles Base Agreement,
                        that the Dominican Republic will wish to enter into such a cooperative
                        military arrangement. In general, that Government’s support for the
                        principle of collective security has been adequate.</p>
                    <p>The Venezuelan Government is essentially preoccupied with the problem of
                        defense of its own territory, which has strategic materials and
                        installations of vital importance to hemisphere and free world defense. In
                        these circumstances, and in view of its limited military capabilities, the
                        problem of participation in hemisphere defense for Venezuela is primarily
                        one of its own protection.</p>
                    <p>The other Latin American countries—Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti,
                        Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, and Paraguay—have extremely limited capability
                        for military participation in the hemisphere regional arrangement. With the
                        exception of Guatemala, however, policies of these governments are in most
                        respects thoroughly cooperative, both with the <gloss target="#t_OAS1"

                    <p>The following represents a consensus of various views with respect to the
                        specific questions which you raised and certain others which have come out
                        as a result of the inquiry.</p>
                    <p>1. The United States Government is clearly committed to the continuance of
                        programs of economic, technical and military assistance to the nations of
                        the free world. The failure in certain circles to recognize the role of
                        these Mutual Security programs as vehicles of foreign policy rather than as
                        ends in themselves has given rise to a confused organizational pattern in
                        both Washington and the field. The Department of State must resume its role
                        of leadership in the formulation of foreign policy and serve as the
                        principal voice of this Government both in Washington and abroad on policy
                        matters arising from or basic to the foreign assistance programs. On the
                        specific question of whether <gloss target="#t_DMS1">DMS</gloss> is a good
                        idea and should be continued, the offices are agreed that the concept of
                            <gloss target="#t_DMS1">DMS</gloss> stems basically from domestic
                        political considerations in derogation of the role of the State Department
                        and should not be continued.</p>
                    <p>On the question of how State-Defense-<gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>
                        coordination could otherwise be achieved, the offices have made no specific
                        organizational recommendations but have generally indicated, in view of the
                        comparative success which had been achieved in coordination during the
                        earlier State role as principal agency, that an overall <pb n="563"
                            xml:id="pg_563" facs="0589"/>interdepartmental coordinating committee
                        should be re-established, chaired by a Special Assistant to the Secretary of
                        State, with subcommittees functioning on a regular basis for each of the
                        four areas.</p>
                    <p>2. If <gloss target="#t_DMS1">DMS</gloss> should be retained it is desirable
                        and imperative that a much greater role be carved out for the Department in
                        the coordinating of Washington as well as field activities under the Mutual
                        Security Act. The situation cannot be continued where it is necessary for
                            <gloss target="#t_DMS1">DMS</gloss> to virtually apologize before
                        Congressional Committees for participation by the Department of State in the
                        presentation and execution of the Mutual Security Programs. Specific
                        recommendations for improving the role of <gloss target="#t_DMS1"
                            >DMS</gloss> are: <list>

                                (ii) insisting on prompt and useful reporting on progress and
                                developments under the programs. (Reporting on military programs has
                                been extremely poor.)</item>

                    <p>3. There is no present source or mechanism which officially assesses progress
                        made under the military and economic programs or presents such data in an
                        understandable manner on a coordinated basis for executive use. Even the
                        extremely limited statistical reports which we formerly received from the
                        Defense Department have now been seriously curtailed to the point where such
                        documents as are received dealing with progress under the programs are more
                        useful for historical archives than as operating documents. This is one of
                        the most serious situations facing the officers whose responsibilities
                        require that they be closely informed on developments under the programs. It
                        is recommended that either <gloss target="#t_DMS1">DMS</gloss> or its
                        successor agency develop an efficient system of executive reporting on an
                        overall basis which would forthrightly and expeditiously place progress data
                        in the hands of top officials concerned with the programs.</p>
                    <p>4. The offices agree on the desirability of eliminating the present split as
                        between <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_TCA1"
                            >TCA</gloss> on the major point that there is merely an artificial
                        distinction between the two agencies. The recommendation is made that the
                        economic agencies should be under <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0590"

                            target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> setup.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_PSA1">PSA</gloss> makes the rather new recommendation that
                        the agency handling programs for Southeast Asia should be integrated with
                        the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs in a manner similar to the organizational
                        lines followed in the field. Thus, “the Chief of the <gloss target="#t_PSA1"
                            >PSA</gloss> area branch in the Washington agency should be deputy to
                        the Director of the Philippine and Southeast Asia Affairs of the Department
                        of State.” It is not very likely that much support would be obtained for
                        this concept of having an “integrated” operational and policy organization.
                        One major criticism probably would be the inevitability of confusion in
                        lines of authority.<note n="3" xml:id="d163fn3">A handwritten notation in

                    <p>5. With respect to the concept of utilizing United Nations agencies <note
                            n="4" xml:id="d163fn4">A question mark apparently written by Johnson

                        a consensus of opinion that far greater use could be made of the
                        multilateral agencies. This concept appears to be more of an instinctive
                        reaction than one based on knowledge that the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> agencies are actually capable or equipped to undertake the
                        programs which the United States is carrying out.</p>
                    <p>6. With respect to organization in the field, and particularly the numbers of
                        Americans abroad, it is the general view that every effort should be made to
                        maintain at the most practicable minimum the number of American citizens
                        employed in aid programs. The offices feel that this Government has suffered
                        embarrassment, unfavorable publicity and considerable confusion from the
                        profusion of personnel sent abroad by temporary organizations. Our
                        representatives in the Far East are reported as being nearly unanimous in
                        their opinion that fewer and better trained personnel would make a more
                        favorable impression and achieve more in helping other nations than is
                        possible in the present “large and sprawling representation”.</p>
                    <p>This is not a new reaction inasmuch as concern has been expressed from time
                        to time about the seemingly large numbers of Americans who are engaged in
                        administering the U.S. aid programs in the various countries of the Far
                        East. While this concern is undoubtedly legitimate in terms of the
                        sensitivity of the political situation in practically all of the countries
                        in the Far East it is not always clear as to whether this concern arises
                        from the simple abstract fact of numbers or whether there have been specific
                        instances where quality has been low and Americans have figured in incidents
                        or situations inimical to U.S. relations with the respective <pb n="565"
                            xml:id="pg_565" facs="0591"/>countries. Perhaps one of the real problems
                        has been the fact that by and large there has been a concentration of the
                        Americans in the large cities or capital areas with very limited dispersal
                        to outlying areas. This has had the effect of precipitating criticism on
                        both the score of concentration of numbers in the cities and the neglect of
                        areas needing U.S. aid outside of the large cities.</p>
                    <p>It is recommended that a careful examination be made of how and where
                        adjustments in personnel serving abroad might be made to tighten up the
                        effectiveness of the organizations. In this connection it would appear that
                        a most beneficial step might be made in reducing the present tendencies
                        toward proliferation of programs in most of our countries. It has also been
                        suggested that, where possible, long range, expensive economic projects
                        should be gradually replaced by technical assistance designed to implement
                        the original premise of the President’s concept of Point IV wherein our
                        objective was stated to be to “help others to help themselves”.</p>
                    <p>7. Very little if any consideration appears to have been given to the
                        possibility of utilizing non-Americans in the various technical aspects of
                        our <gloss target="#t_STEM1">STEM</gloss> programs. It is quite conceivable
                        that we could hire personnel from the Scandinavian countries in the Public
                        Health field, Japanese technicians for developing the extractive resources
                        of Southeast Asia and perhaps even Japanese or Southern Europeans in the
                        agricultural fields. The Japanese rice production methods could be most
                        profitably copied in Southeast Asia.<note n="5" xml:id="d163fn5">Johnson

                    <p>8. Our economic aid programs generally are in need of greater coordination
                        with the Department of Defense, particularly where they are in support of
                        the defense effort. Appropriate machinery should be established in
                        Washington and refined in the field for a direct and continuing assessment
                        of the contribution which U.S. economic aid should make toward the defense
                        effort. While the role of the Ambassador in this field has been materially

                        of treatment in this memorandum but which might perhaps be touched on in
                        discussions arising out of this paper. While I have drawn to a large extent
                        on the papers prepared by the offices in preparing this memorandum I thought
                        you might find it useful, if time permits, to read the office papers because
                        of the somewhat different emphasis from which each has approached the

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: During the past few days I
                        have had several talks with Fred Lawton about the proposed Mutual Security
                        Program for the fiscal year 1954. I have given Fred frankly my views about
                        the program, but I do not know what he will decide to recommended to you.
                        After reviewing the requests totaling about $9.5 billion as presented by
                        State, Defense and M.S.A., I recommended a figure of approximately $7.7
                        billion, exclusive of infrastructure of about $200 million which was not
                        covered by last year’s program. It may well be that several hundred million
                        dollars more can be squeezed out of this figure of $7.9 billion without
                        endangering the program, but before expressing a definite view I would want
                        to get more information from the Defense Department, inasmuch as the
                        appropriations for military items are by far the largest portion of the
                        program. There are so many uncertainties ahead during the next eighteen
                        months that I believe there should be some elbow room in the sums requested
                        to take care of requirements that cannot be clearly defined today.</p>
                    <p>I hope that you will not find it necessary to come to a decision until Dean,
                        Bob and I return from Paris, now scheduled for Friday, December 19th.<note

                    <p>In Mr. Longanecker’s<note n="1" xml:id="d165fn1">David E. Longanecker of the
                            Office of African Affairs.</note> absence, I attended a meeting this
                        noon at which Mr. Battle explained a recent action of the Budget Bureau on
                        the 1954 budget for the foreign aid program.</p>
                    <p>He informed the group that the budget had been tentatively cut by the Budget
                        Bureau from 7.8 billion to 5.8 billion dollars. This drastic reduction, he
                        said, will require a review of programs with a view to accommodating our
                        thinking to the new figure. But first he wanted to know of any appeals that
                        should be made from the Budget Bureau’s action so that he might draft today
                        a letter from the Secretary transmitting such appeals to the Bureau of the
                            Budget.<note n="2" xml:id="d165fn2">No such letter has been
                            found.</note> In my opinion the discussion produced no basis requiring
                        appeal on the part of AF.</p>
                    <p>The following facts, however, will be of interest to you. The military
                        section of the proposed budget was most drastically affected. Funds for Arab
                        economic programs were cut from $55 million to $40 million. This is the item
                        which supposedly carries some $2,000,000 of special economic assistance for
                        Libya.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out to Mr. Gardiner after the meeting that the seriousness of AF’s
                        need for this $2,000,000 will depend upon the progress made in our Libyan
                        base negotiations. I said that if we are successful in obtaining an
                        agreement on the basis of available Air Force funds, the $2,000,000 item in
                        the 1954 budget may be reviewed solely in the light of the merits of the
                        Libyan economic program on which it is based (in which case, I think Libya
                        would stand little chance of getting the $2,000,000). On the other hand,
                        however, if the Libyans insist on a larger amount than the Air Force has
                        made available, the $2,000,000 item in the 1954 budget may become a matter
                        of paramount importance to AF and will, in my opinion, have to be assigned a
                        very high priority in the list of Arab-States requirements. In this latter
                        event, there would be no question of determining the availability of these
                        funds for Libya on the basis of <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0594"/>the
                        merits of the economic program outlined in the budget, but rather on
                        political grounds. Mr. Gardiner seemed to accept my thesis and indicated
                        that he will proceed on this basis.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Battle also reported that the $76 million requested for dependent
                        overseas territories had been reduced to $25 million. The Budget Bureau
                        explained that it had discussed this item with the Ex-Im Bank and that the
                        latter had agreed to adopt a more liberal policy in respect to loans for
                        such areas in the future. The Budget Bureau had, therefore, decided to cut
                        the amount for the dependent overseas territories to $25 million with this
                        understanding. This item, of course, represents the remains of the Bayne
                        Plan. In response to a question as to whether or not <gloss target="#t_NEA1"
                            >NEA</gloss> should appeal this reduction in the letter which Mr. Battle
                        proposes to draft, I stated that, in view of the Administration’s stricter
                        approach as reflected in the Budget Bureau action on more important items, a
                        State Department appeal on this particular item would not be warranted. Mr.
                        Battle said that he heartily concurred in this view.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Battle urged strongly that the Budget Bureau action and any of the
                        figures involved therein not be divulged to anyone because of the serious
                        political repercussions that would result, particularly in European
                            countries.<note n="3" xml:id="d165fn3">The notes of the Secretary’s

                    <p>This is in reply to your memorandum of December 31, 1952, with respect to the
                        steps we have taken with representatives of General Eisenhower to facilitate
                        an orderly transition to the incoming Administration.</p>
                    <p>As soon as Senator Lodge and Mr. Dodge were designated as General
                        Eisenhower’s representatives, I telephoned both of them <pb n="569"
                            xml:id="pg_569" facs="0595"/>and offered to help them in any way I
                        could. I later had two fairly extensive meetings with Mr. Dodge to outline
                        for him some of the issues which would be coming up in the Mutual Security
                        Program. I also made documents available to him for his background
                        information.</p>
                    <p>When it was announced that Mr. Stassen was to be the new Director for Mutual
                        Security, I telephoned him, and also wrote to him, offering to do everything
                        possible to make the transition a smooth one.</p>
                    <p>Since then Mr. Stassen and I have met several times to discuss the problems
                        he will face as Director for Mutual Security. In addition, he has met with
                        most of the senior members of my staff on specific problems in their fields
                        of responsibility.</p>
                    <p>We have provided Mr. Stassen with considerable material, both classified and
                        unclassified, including briefing books on the substance of the problems
                        which are likely to arise, a statistical data book, and memoranda concerning
                        the key personnel of Mutual Security and administrative orientation.</p>
                    <p>Additional material is being developed which will be made available promptly
                        to Mr. Stassen at his earliest convenience.</p>
                    <p>All of our personnel are standing by to give oral presentations to the new
                        Director, as he may desire, and all of Mr. Stassen’s requests for specific
                        information, of which there have been several, have been promptly satisfied
                        in full.</p>
                    <p>In addition, we suggested to Mr. Stassen that he allow us to begin security
                        checks on anyone he desires to bring with him, so that they could begin
                        working with him on classified materials just as soon as he takes office.
                        These necessary security checks are now being made.</p>
                    <p>To sum up, I believe we have done everything we could to make it possible for
                        Mr. Stassen to assume office with the minimum loss of momentum in the
                        execution of the Mutual Security Program.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Stassen</hi>: One of the first and most
                        important tasks of our new administration is to review the 1954 Budget and
                        to proceed toward the accomplishment of a balanced budget.</p>
                    <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0596"/>
                    <p>This review will take the initial steps toward that goal; will establish in
                        definitive form how far we can go in that direction in the fiscal year 1954;
                        and set the stage for the fiscal year 1955. It should help to identify
                        issues that will be significant in the formulation of the budget for that
                        year.</p>
                    <p>The problem is complicated by inheritance of the costs of a Federal debt of
                        more than $265 billion; indicated deficits for the fiscal years 1953–1954
                        totaling $15.8 billion; and accumulated unexpended balances of
                        appropriations in excess of the total new obligational authority requested
                        for fiscal year 1954.</p>
                    <p>It is clear that this situation will not be brought under control without
                        action to reduce budgetary obligational authority, reduce the level of
                        expenditures, critically examine existing programs, restrain commitments for
                        new programs, and generally to drive for greater efficiency and reduced
                        costs.</p>
                    <p>In this review the policies shall be as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p><hi rend="italic">With respect to personnel:</hi> It is the policy to

                            <p>It is the policy to achieve a progressive reduction of personnel for
                                the remainder of the fiscal year 1953 and for the 1954 Budget.
                                Variations from this policy, as applied to individual departments
                                and agencies, will be granted by the President in his review of the
                                1954 Budget only upon specific request and adequate justification by
                                the department or agency head.</p>

                            <p>It is the policy to achieve a progressive reduction of personnel for
                                the remainder of the fiscal year 1953 and for the 1954 budget.
                                Variations from this policy, as applied to individual departments
                                and agencies, will be granted by the President in his review of the
                                1954 budget only upon specific request and adequate justification by
                                the department or agency head.”</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>In applying this policy to the Mutual Security Program it is necessary to
                        distinguish sharply between personnel who are paid from administrative funds
                        (hereafter referred to as “administrative personnel”) and personnel who are
                        paid from program funds (hereafter referred to as “program personnel”). The
                        following sections describe the manner in which, as to each of these two
                        classes of personnel, the Bureau of the Budget’s policy will be applied to
                        the conduct of the Mutual Security Program by all participating agencies.
                        Since this policy must be applied to such a variety of personnel and
                        operations throughout the Government, unforeseen contingencies are likely to
                        arise. As they do, or when difficulties are encountered in applying the
                        following interpretations in individual cases, the participating agencies
                        should consult this office for further guidance.</p>

                                substantially different from the approach which is taken to a
                                reduction in <gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss> administrative
                                personnel. A reduction, or even the non-expansion, of current levels
                                of program personnel may constitute a reduction in approved
                                substantive programs. For example, a reduction in the number of
                                personnel who are directly engaged in technical assistance projects
                                would, in itself, represent the curtailment of going programs which
                                the U.S., in the case of many countries, has committed itself to
                                carry out under various international agreements. Similarly, a
                                reduction in the personnel who are employed in the packing,
                                handling, crating and shipment of military end-items could seriously
                                interfere with <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> deliveries.
                                Consequently, any freeze on program <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574"
                                    facs="0600"/>employment, or the imposition of any fixed
                                employment ceiling on program personnel, should follow—and not
                                precede—the thorough re-examination, now in process, of currently
                                approved 1953 programs. After this review has been completed, and a
                                determination is made as to whether, and if so, how, to reduce or
                                eliminate any programs, such a determination may, in fact, be a
                                determination to reduce program personnel. The decision to do so,
                                however, is a program decision.</item>

                            <item>Even though, for the foregoing reasons, no employment ceiling, or
                                freeze, on program personnel is being imposed at this time, each
                                participating agency must nevertheless carefully scrutinize all

                                Budget criteria quoted above. In other words, the necessity for

                                the number of program personnel must not be taken as a reason for

                                where, without in any way modifying the level of program execution,
                                such reductions can be accomplished through increased efficiency,
                                better utilization of personnel or improved methods of

                        reviewing vacancies in the light of the specific Bureau of the Budget
                        criteria, each agency will intensify its efforts to improve management and

                        thereby to reduce the personnel and funds which are required. Some of the
                        agencies have recently conducted management reviews of this character in
                        connection with the Ribicoff Amendment, and thorough management reviews will

                    <p>Mr. Stassen stated that he would be personally available in the event that
                        problems arise that might affect this schedule. He also announced that he
                        would secure the President’s approval of a set of assumptions that might
                        affect the timetable, such as Formosa and India.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Discussion:</hi> Mr. Ohly noted that some of the dates that
                        would affect the timetable would be the March 2 date for submission to the
                        Bureau of the Budget of the agency program re-examinations, March 25th when
                        the report of the Evaluation Project would be received, the April 23rd
                        meeting of the North Atlantic Council and the end of the fiscal year on June
                        30. Mr. Tannenwald suggested adding May 14 as the date when Congressional
                        leaders had advised the President that appropriation legislation be through
                        the House and the Senate.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ohly said the problem of gathering the presentation group and the
                        necessary briefing and presentation documents should be considered in
                        developing the timetable.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Macy suggested that the Bureau thought the authorization legislation
                        should go to the Hill by April 1 and that it should contain no
                        administrative reorganization plans but that any such plans should be
                        achieved under the Reorganization Act.<note n="3" xml:id="d169fn3">Reference
                            is presumably to the 1953 Reorganization Act in which the 83d Congress,
                            in its first major action, granted President Eisenhower the same powers
                            to reorganize the executive agencies of the Federal Government as
                            President Truman had possessed under the Reorganization Act of 1949. The
                            bill, <gloss target="#t_HR1">H.R.</gloss> 1979, which became Public Law
                            83–3 on Feb. 6, 1953, extended the expiration date of the 1949
                            Reorganization Act from Apr. 1, 1953, to Apr. 1, 1955.</note></p>
                    <p>Mr. Stassen observed that even with the $7.6 billion figure the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces planned for 1954 could not be
                        achieved. Mr. Nash reported that General Ridgway, whom Defense will rely on
                        as a chief witness, wants to be able to have his testimony anchored to firm
                        forces which are to be added to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> after
                        ’53. On this last point he observed that Defense is thinking in terms of 13
                        or 14 divisions while Mr. Martin and Mr. Ohly believe it would be closer to
                        10 or 12.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stassen asked if the depth concept could justify the amounts in the
                        present budget. Mr. Nash replied that he did not believe that they could
                        since not all of the items would be common to the Ridgway and the depth
                        concepts.</p>
                    <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0604"/>
                    <p>Mr. Stassen asked how long it would take Defense to build up a program
                        following the Administration’s budget review. General Stewart replied that
                        in fifteen days it would be possible to have a program which could be
                        defended by categories although there might not be complete detail on all
                        items. He noted that the military program for all Titles other than Title I
                        can be justified by the services on the basis of the information that they
                        now have. General Stewart estimated that April 15th would be the earliest
                        date that Defense could go to Congress if the budget revision decisions are
                        available by March 15 and <gloss target="#t_DMS1">DMS</gloss> agrees to the
                        military program.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stassen raised the problem of working <gloss target="#t_OSP1">OSP</gloss>
                        into the program and Mr. Ohly indicated that a minimum of one week should be
                        allowed for <gloss target="#t_DMS1">DMS</gloss> to secure the coordination
                        of all agencies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Martin said that State would require six weeks following the President’s
                        decision on the final figure for the program before it could go to the
                        Congress and suggested the Executive Branch not try to make its presentation
                        prior to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministers Meeting April
                            23-25.<note n="4" xml:id="d169fn4">For documentation on the Eleventh

                        stated that General Ridgway would not be available as a witness until after
                        the Council Meeting.</p>
                    <p>Mr. C. T. Wood stated that <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> could come
                        within the same time limits as General Stewart had suggested for Defense. He
                        suggested that it should be only in unusual circumstances that we tell
                        Congress that the size of our program depends on the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council Meeting.</p>
                    <p>In response to a question by Mr. Stassen, Mr. C. T. Wood indicated that the
                        Committees do not go very far into individual country programs at the
                        beginning of the hearings. He said that in general the House Appropriations
                        and Foreign Affairs Committees get into much more detail than do the Senate
                        Committees and that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is inclined to
                        scrutinize the programs for particular countries in which certain committee
                        members are interested. He said that the Senate Appropriations Committee
                        hearings are usually brief with the members asking questions which they have
                        received from their constituents.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Willis said that Treasury would like to have the program presented as
                        late as possible. He noted that Treasury would be meeting through March with
                        finance officials of several countries participating in the program.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stassen asked if there was any possibility of preparing to present
                        special concepts such as <gloss target="#t_OSP1">OSP</gloss> or Asian
                        policy. Mr. C. T. Wood <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0605"/>and Mr. Ohly
                        mentioned the use in past years of work with the Committee staffs and
                        advance consultation with the chairmen and ranking members of the
                        Committees.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Claxton stated that Rep. Chiperfield has urged the Executive Branch to
                        present its program as soon as possible. He also observed that Congress is
                        hoping for a session that will end at approximately the same time as it did
                        last year, June 30, but that if hearings on the program do not begin until
                        May 1 that is 1½ months later than the hearings began last year.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Efron stated that he would prefer seeking only technical amendments to
                        existing legislation or alternatively seeking new legislation giving the
                        executive broad authority. Mr. Eichholz expressed the view that the House
                        Foreign Affairs Committee will not accept merely technical amendments. Mr.
                        Efron observed that Rep. Chiperfield has suggested using the Richards bill
                            (<gloss target="#t_HR1">H.R.</gloss> 1071) as a basis for the
                        committee’s work. He mentioned that the Executive Branch has prepared a
                        lengthy substitute bill.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Macy stated that the Bureau of the Budget suggested leaving
                        organizational matters out of the bill. Mr. C. T. Wood said that advance
                        consultation will draw out the administrative amendments that committee
                        members may suggest. He suggested the Executive Branch might be prepared to
                        accept an administrative device if it is popular with the committees if it
                        would speed the overall legislation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Martin noted that reorganizations under the Reorganization Act will now
                        be considered by the McCarthy sub-committee. He suggested that the
                        Administration should not let the changes wait until May. Mr. Stassen
                        suggested that there should be advance consultation on any proposed
                        reorganization. Mr. Efron suggested that House leaders do not see how the
                        new administration can come up with good reorganization plans soon and might
                        be willing to wait for next year’s presentation. Mr. Tannenwald noted that
                        unless changes under the authority of the Reorganization Act are proposed by
                        early March the 60-day period will not run.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Nash cautioned that the reasons for not presenting the program earlier
                        should be the need for program review by the new administration rather than
                        solely one of waiting for the outcome of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                        though there would be disadvantages, to begin the Congressional Presentation
                        with the Far or Middle Eastern programs as early as April 15.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Martin stressed the need for going to Congress for a new Act. Mr. Macy
                        concurred.</p>
                    <pb n="580" xml:id="pg_580" facs="0606"/>
                    <p>Mr. Martin noted that some of the agencies had not been informed of some of
                        the information that <gloss target="#t_DMS1">DMS</gloss> desires in the
                        February 25th submittal. Mr. Ohly stated that he had just sent memos to the
                        agencies indicating the material sought by way of testing the effect of
                        reductions on certain programs.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Fund Available for All Titles</hi></p>
                    <p>Mr. Nash asked whether the Bureau of the Budget will ask for a sum—as an
                        example he used the figure of $1 billion—which will be authorized for
                        programming by the Executive Branch in any area. Mr. Macy indicated that he
                        has instructions to eliminate any “contingency” funds. Mr. Nash pointed to
                        the need for a sum whose use would be in accord with one of several
                        authorized alternatives. Mr. Stassen observed that much effort will be
                        called for to explain the reasons and need for large unexpended balances and
                        that if such an “alternatives fund” is not used at the year’s end that
                        should merit reward rather than Congressional reproach. Mr. C. T. Wood
                        stated that Representative Taber’s view would be that the Executive Branch
                        does not know what it wants the money for.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Stassen mentioned the need for positive steps to prevent any adverse
                        crystallization of Congressional opinion between now and the opening of the
                        hearings. Mention was made of the advisability of advance consultation with
                        staff and Committee members as well as the Chairmen and ranking members. Mr.
                        Nash noted that the Executive Branch may get into the whole <gloss

                        Agreements and Protocol get into the Senate soon. Mr. Claxton suggested
                        consideration of the value of overseas trips by the seven new members of the
                        House Foreign Affairs Committee (6 Republicans, 1 Democrat) and the five new
                        members of the Foreign Relations Committee (3 Republicans, 2 Democrats). In
                        response to a question by Mr. Stassen, Mr. C. T. Wood noted that the
                        Chairmen of the Committees have indicated that they must approve the
                        spending of counterpart for any trips. Mr. C. T. Wood urged further that a
                        maximum amount of effort be put on consultation. He also advised avoiding
                        steps that would result in newspaper publicity.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Efron suggested that Defense should delay taking to the Congress the Army
                        legislation approving certain transfers which have taken place in Japan. Mr.
                        C. T. Wood stated that he would oppose delay if it meant that the bill would
                        come to Congress at the time that the Appropriations Committees are
                        considering the final amount for the entire Mutual Security Program.</p>

                        responsibilities for handling the various parts of the Congressional

                    <p>Mr. Efron suggested that next week the Committee should discuss and seek a
                        decision on the type of legislation to be sought.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Nash observed that following the Munitions Allocation Council Meeting on
                        February 16th on the purchase of $300 million of ammunition a policy problem
                        will arise on the division of the amount between France and Italy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Nash stated he believed that there were some outstanding problems on 1953
                        Defense Support that might come before the Committee. Mr. Ohly stated that
                        he was not certain that they were ready for Committee consideration.</p>
                    <p>Mr. C. T. Wood suggested that there be further consideration of the

                    <p>In preparing this material the responsible officers in the Department have

                        of the latter to the President. The basic issue at this point will be how
                        large the foreign aid program should be in the light of the need to balance
                        and reduce taxes.</p>

                        subsequent directions issued by your office, the Department of State has
                        re-examined its <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954, Program proposals
                        for those activities of the <gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss> which are
                        the operational responsibility of the Department. As a result of this
                        review, the Department’s position is that for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1954, funds in the amount of $507,175,000 are required to
                        carry out those activities if the successful attainment of our foreign
                        policy objectives is not to be endangered.</p>
                    <p>In reaching this conclusion, full consideration has been given to the effect
                        on programs and on United States objectives of the illustrative reductions
                        in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 <gloss target="#t_MSP1"
                            >MSP</gloss> Budget suggested by your office. A detailed description of
                        such effects is set forth in the attached documentation.</p>
                    <p>For the Near East and Africa, the previous <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        proposal provided $240 million for technical assistance and economic
                        development aid. Your office proposed illustrative reductions of $90 million
                        and $175 million. The cut of $175 million would require a thorough revision
                        of United States foreign policy objectives in this area. It would set back
                        prospects of strengthening the Arab States along the lines which we consider
                        necessary if this region is not to be lost to the communists by default. It
                        would result in <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> withdrawing from certain
                        countries and, in others, maintaining only a nominal program. This would
                        encourage elements inimical to United States <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585"
                            facs="0611"/>interests to take steps resulting in further <gloss
                            target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> withdrawals. In the case of Israel, virtual
                        abandonment of our support to that nation in its efforts to achieve
                        stability and viability might result.</p>
                    <p>The full reduction of $90 million would prevent this Government from pursuing
                        programs necessary for the achievement of our foreign policy objectives in
                        this area. However, a smaller reduction of $65 million is acceptable to this
                        Department. We propose to achieve this reduction by postponing any request
                        for the actual appropriation of funds for contributions to the United
                        Nations Relief and Works Agency under the Palestine Refugee Aid Act. It will
                        be necessary to seek in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 an
                        authorization for the appropriation of funds to furnish evidence of our
                        continuing interest in and support of this program.</p>
                    <p>The Department is not attempting, at this time, to discuss <gloss
                            target="#t_MEDO1">MEDO</gloss>, a subject of vital concern in this area
                        of the world. The Department of Defense is covering this item in its program
                        review, and the Department of State will fully support the proposal at the
                        appropriate time.</p>
                    <p>For South and Southeast Asia, the previous <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1954 proposal provided $270 million for <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>
                        programs in this area. Illustrative reductions of $150 million and $75
                        million were suggested by your office. These reductions were to be applied
                        in the programs for India, Pakistan and Burma.</p>
                    <p>In its re-examination of the proposed reductions, the Department found little
                        major change in the political situations. This area’s importance to the free
                        world remains undiminished and would increase if tensions in the Far East
                        mount further. Within each of these countries, the present government has
                        reaffirmed its friendliness toward the western democracies even while
                        maintaining an official position of neutrality in the conflict between East
                        and West. However, important factions, hostile to United States interests,
                        exist in each of the countries in this area and they seek to capitalize on
                        any opportunity to divert their peoples from their present western
                        orientation.</p>
                    <p>In view of the foregoing, the Department of State is of the opinion that the
                        suggested reduction of $150 million in this program could not be
                        accomplished without seriously jeopardizing the attainment of our foreign
                        policy goals in this area. However, a reduction of $73 million appears, at
                        this time, to be feasible, and the Department of State recommends the
                        approval of $197 million for its programs in South and Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>For Latin America, the previous <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 <gloss
                            target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss> proposal included $25 million for technical
                        assistance. Illustrative reductions of $10 million and $3 million below this
                        level were proposed.</p>
                    <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0612"/>
                    <p>As an important part of the free world, the Latin American republics,
                        geographically, occupy or control the approaches to critical areas and
                        installations in this hemisphere; economically, they are an important source
                        of many strategic and critical materials; and politically, they exercise a
                        powerful voice in the determination of United Nations policies. At present
                        there is a wide gap between the willingness of these countries to share the
                        responsibility of maintaining the peace by safeguarding this hemisphere, and
                        their ability to carry out this responsibility. The ability to develop their
                        economies to acquire a position of security and to maintain internal order
                        is of prime importance to our own national security. Any reduction in this
                        proportionately small program would have an immediate adverse reaction
                        throughout Latin America. For the same reasons, we support the proposed $1
                        million for the technical assistance program of the Organization of American
                        States.</p>
                    <p>With respect to other programs administered by the Department, it is our view
                        that the Escapee Program<note n="3" xml:id="d171fn3">For documentation on
                            the escapee program, see <ref target="frus1952-54v01p2#pg_1560">pp.
                                1560</ref> ff.</note> should be increased to $12 million for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 to enable the program to operate on a
                        global basis, including Yugoslav escapees. At this time, it seems possible
                        that the United Nations Technical Assistance contribution might be reduced
                        to $12,750,000 from the proposed $15,000,000. It should be noted that this
                        estimate is undergoing re-examination in connection with a general review of
                        United States policy with respect to the United Nations Technical Assistance
                        Program. The contribution to the Inter-governmental Committee for European
                        Migration should be continued at the present level of $10 million, leaving
                        open for further study the question of United States contribution to capital
                        needs of emigrants. Pending the outcome of the study being undertaken on
                        Korean economic needs, we should provide for a contribution to the United
                        Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency of $71 million in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 plus the availability of a military
                        pipeline of supplies up to $40 million in value.</p>
                    <p>Members of the Department will be available to discuss with your staff the
                        Department’s recommendations.<note n="4" xml:id="d171fn4">The source text

                                    the Council on Feb. 10, 1953. This review of basic national
                                    security policies stressed the relationship of such policies to
                                    cost and to overall national economic health, and culminated in

                    <p>In order to make this study certain arbitrary assumptions are necessary with
                        respect to: (a) the distribution of allowable expenditures among the many
                        separate segments of the Mutual Security Program; and (b) the level, or
                        alternative levels, of permissible expenditures in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1956. The following assumptions with respect to each of the
                        foregoing are to be used in undertaking the work called for below:</p>
                    <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">Distribution of Allowable Expenditures</hi>—Since it is
                        impossible, without more information than is presently at hand, to make even
                        a temporary judgment as to the best division, from a national security
                        standpoint, between military and non-military aid programs of the total
                        allowable expenditures, it appears desirable to work from three alternative
                        series of assumptions. These alternative series of assumptions, insofar as
                        they concern the non-military aid programs, are as follows:</p>

                            billion</hi>—It will be assumed, at these levels, that there can be no

                    <p>Governor Stassen first handed out a lengthy report on the subject, and then
                        asked permission to have members of his staff who had prepared the report
                        present during his oral summary. For approximately a half hour, with the
                        assistance of his staff and of a series of charts, Governor Stassen briefed
                        the Council on the problem which had been assigned to him. His conclusion as
                        to the effect of the proposed cut was extremely gloomy. He felt that a cut
                        of these proportions might well, for example, spell the end of the French
                        effort to save Indo-China, and might also result in French refusal to ratify
                        the <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> treaties. Similar grim repercussions
                        could be anticipated in other crucial areas of the free world.</p>
                    <p>After some discussion, in response to the President’s query as to whether the
                        cutback was in the budgetary program or in the expenditure program, Governor
                        Stassen went on to stress that not the least serious impact of the proposed
                        cut was that the United States was already so thinly spread in many areas
                        which it needed to defend from Communist attack. The psychological effects
                        were all the more serious when you considered the timing of the proposed
                        cut. Much of the training, for example, of the foreign forces which were to
                        be equipped with United States matériel had been completed. So likewise was
                        much of the infrastructure. All that was now needed was to send the
                        matériel, and it was really beginning to flow in considerable volume. To
                        stop it now would mean withholding from our friends and allies the last
                        increment of aid which was needed to help them stand on their feet. This
                        would not only be a serious material blow but a very bad psychological
                        move.</p>
                    <p>After this conclusion by Governor Stassen, the Vice President inquired
                        whether Governor Stassen’s views indicated that he and his people had
                        already reached the conclusion that the figure for foreign aid in the Truman
                        budget was about the minimum figure <pb n="594" xml:id="pg_594" facs="0620"
                        />which the Mutual Security Administration was prepared to recommend to the
                        President and the Congress.</p>
                    <p>Governor Stassen said that he was unable to go that far and that his report
                        had been merely designed to show what would happen if cuts of the magnitude
                        proposed should actually be made. Obviously the effects of such cuts would
                        be very grave indeed, but he was not prepared to make any specific
                        recommendations at this point. For one thing, it was vitally important to
                        hear from Secretary Wilson on the Defense program scheduled for next week’s
                        Council meeting.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Wilson interposed to say that he anticipated that the Defense
                        Department would find itself compelled to deal with much the same kind of
                        problem, and, he added, “we will probably have to try to strike some kind of
                        compromise between the figure for the Defense program set forth in the
                        Truman budget and the figure which would result if the proposed cut were to
                        be made.”</p>
                    <p>Secretary Smith then stated that he wanted to take this opportunity to
                        register his strong support of Governor Stassen’s delineation of the
                        dangerous results of a cut of this magnitude. He admitted that we were faced
                        with very terrible alternatives. It seemed to him that it was not going to
                        cost less but more if the United States was to achieve the objectives that
                        it sought in Asia. This was an inescapable conclusion.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President stated that there seemed very good reason to recommend
                        against such a cut as this in view of the effects that Governor Stassen had
                        outlined. But he felt that he must warn of the serious political problem
                        which the Administration would face in Congress if no cuts were made. Most
                        members of Congress were happily convinced that a substantial cut could and
                        should be made. If the National Security Council were to conclude that we
                        cannot cut the budget, or worse, that we must even raise our sights, it
                        would require a very impressive selling program in Congress.</p>
                    <p>Governor Stassen admitted the wisdom of the Vice President’s view, but said
                        that he thought he had recently detected some slight shift in Congressional
                        feeling that a cut in the national security programs must be made. Of
                        course, there still remained an educational job to be done, but when we
                        reach whatever conclusions we do, and the President agrees to these
                        conclusions, every effort should be made to carry them through the Congress,
                        and Governor Stassen believed that the President’s leadership would win
                        out.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that he thought the answer was “yes” if, prior to any
                        decision as to the size of the national security programs, we could take a
                        good hard look at the very real savings that could be made in the areas of
                        administration, overhead, and procurement in these programs. This was
                        something which needed the <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595" facs="0621"/>most
                        careful investigation, and assurance that this investigation has been made
                        and all possible economies effected would go a long way to help sell
                        Congress on the necessity for supporting the figure recommended by the
                        Administration.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cutler stated that Secretary Dulles had requested him to announce that
                        Secretary Dulles supported the conclusions reached in Governor Stassen’s
                        written report and oral summary if Governor Stassen’s assumptions were borne
                        in mind.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Wilson said that he felt that he could not at this time give his
                        opinion on Governor Stassen’s estimate, and asked to reserve his views until
                        the conclusion of next week’s Defense Department presentation. Nevertheless,
                        Secretary Wilson said that he did not feel that all the possibilities for
                        effecting real savings in the budgets for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1954 had been thoroughly explored. There were still possibilities such as a
                        stretch-out of the time of readiness, a reappraisal of certain of our
                        objectives, and a balance of inventories. Certainly none of these and others
                        were sacred cows which ought to escape careful scrutiny.</p>

                        Action 730–c, which requested a report on: (1) the revisions in Mutual
                        Security programs which would be necessary in order to reduce expenditures
                        for such programs to an aggregate of $5.5 billion in <gloss target="#t_FY1"

                        national security policies and objectives. The foregoing statement was in
                        turn based upon separate reports from the Departments of State and Defense,
                        and the Mutual Security Agency, copies of which were attached.</p>

                    <p>In view of the fact, illustrated in Table I, that the total resources
                        available (expenditures allowable), within the foregoing expenditure
                        limitations, would be grossly inadequate to carry out all current programs
                        at the levels and rates heretofore contemplated, it was necessary to make
                        assumptions with respect to the most balanced and effective distribution of
                        those resources available (expenditures allowable) among the more than 100
                        separate components of the Mutual Security Program. Recognizing the variety
                        of possible choices, and not wishing to prejudge the best, three alternative
                        illustrative assumptions were made with respect to the allocation of the
                        total expenditures allowed for each year between (a) military aid programs
                        and (b) economic aid programs. Then, within the framework of each such
                        illustrative allocation, further assumptions were made as to the
                        distribution among individual programs. <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597"
                            facs="0623"/>These three alternative expenditures assumptions are shown
                        in Table I, which also shows planned expenditures for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1954 as reflected in the submissions of the several agencies
                        in the Special <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 Budget Review, (pp.
                        1–2)</p>
                    <p>While numerous minor variations in the foregoing illustrative expenditure
                        patterns are possible, the extent of major choice is, as a practical matter,
                        severely limited by the extent to which the conduct of past and present
                        programs has already imposed relatively inflexible expenditure patterns for
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 and, to a lesser degree, for
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955. Of the $12.5 billion of
                        unexpended Mutual Security balances on February 28, 1953, all but $4.9
                        billion had been obligated as of January 31, 1953 and the balance mostly
                        represented: (a) funds which, while not technically obligated, must, under
                        the terms of international understandings and agreements, be obligated
                        before the end of this fiscal year for specific purposes; and (b) the cost
                        of procuring and shipping military equipment, and of providing training,
                        which the U.S., through representations in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> and directly to other countries, had strongly implied that
                        it would furnish even if it had not technically committed itself to do so.
                        Drastic changes in expenditure patterns would therefore require cancellation
                        of contracts, the abrogation of international commitments, the extension of
                        delivery dates under existing contracts, and the non-obligation of funds
                        which, though programmed for known requirements, still remain unobligated,

                        illustratively the cutbacks in planned expenditures for major foreign aid

                        ceiling to those for foreign aid during each year since 1946. Since (a)
                        about 94% of the program represents payments for goods and services
                        commercially procured and contributions to international organizations (See
                        Chart II) and (b) approximately ⅘ of the remainder reflects the cost of

                        reductions in expenditures would represent nearly equivalent reductions in
                        the real resources transferred to foreign aid recipients. In other words,
                        the area in which dollar savings may be affected by administrative and
                        operational economies is insignificant in relation to the program as a
                        whole. The following paragraphs summarize some of the more specific program
                        revisions which would be required under the three alternative assumptions,

                    <p>The reduction required in economic aid would, under Assumption A, completely
                        change the relationship of the United States to the European defense effort
                        and result in about $3 billion less in European defense expenditures in
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 than presently estimated, with a

                        1955. Serious resulting balance of payments difficulties would in turn cause
                        deliberalization of trade, reduced economic activity, higher unemployment
                            <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0626"/>and pressures to expand Soviet

                        and therefore of German, rearmament, would improve but still be poor; <gloss

                        postpone its full impact beyond the crucial 1956 elections. Under the other
                        assumptions, the 5-year plan could not succeed, and its failure might place
                        India beyond the point where massive U.S. aid could be effective, (pp.

                        activity in Formosa and Indochina, Assumption C would require some
                        postponement, but no alteration in the basic character, of measures now
                        planned to create stability and to support presently planned military
                        establishments. Under Assumption B, the attainment of military and economic
                        strength would be further postponed, and under Assumption A, major projects
                        would have to be abandoned, or fundamentally revised, and local expenditures
                        required to sustain military efforts would be inadequate, (pp. 40–41;

                    <p>Since total requirements for Indochina would be met as a first priority, the

                        Japanese rearmament would be negligible. The possibility of larger and
                        stronger indigenous forces in this area, capable of reducing requirements
                        for U.S. units, would be largely removed. (pp. 41–43)</p>

                    <p>Reduced expenditures for economic aid would, to a greater or lesser degree,
                        depending on the assumption selected, have the following effects: Create the
                        impression that the U.S. was defaulting on existing commitments; strengthen
                        the position of anti-U.S. elements; weaken hemisphere solidarity and
                        prejudice the cooperative role of the Latin American nations in hemisphere
                        defense, their support of our policies in <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                        strategic and critical materials needed by the United States. The virtual

                        American units might take over missions which, in the event of war, would
                        otherwise require the deployment of substantial U.S. forces; and would

                        programs, with a view toward progressive reductions in new obligations and
                        in expenditure levels under the Mutual Security Program. It now seems
                        appropriate to give you a summary report on the actions which have been

                        subsequent to its formal transmittal, this office informally brought to your

                        impracticability of a literal application to the <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1953 Mutual Security Program of many of the specific
                        criteria or ground rules which your letter suggested. In this respect, as we
                        noted, our situation is similar to that of the Department of Defense in
                        relation to certain of the military programs. We review this situation
                        below.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">I—The Relation of the February 3d letter
                            to the Mutual Security Program</hi></p>
                    <p>A. <hi rend="italic">As to personnel</hi>—</p>
                    <p>While personnel costs represent a minor fraction of the total costs of the
                        Mutual Security Program, it is nonetheless of the utmost importance, for the
                        reasons hereinafter set forth, to draw a sharp distinction between “
                        administrative personnel” and “program personnel”—between personnel who are
                        the overhead engaged in the administration and execution of the program on
                        the one hand, and personnel who constitute a part of the program itself on
                        the other hand. Thus, although something like four percent of the total cost
                        of the Mutual Security Program is directly attributable to the cost of
                        personnel, as indicated in Appendix A hereto,<note n="3" xml:id="d175fn3">No
                            appendixes accompany the source text.</note> about seven-tenths of this
                        amount represents what we commonly call “program costs”; and reductions in
                        “program costs” reflect, for the most part, not administrative savings
                        resultant from improved efficiency and the elimination of executive waste or
                        duplication, but actual cutback in the real resources provided our <pb
                            n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0632"/>friends as foreign aid. This
                        distinction is so important that the principal illustrations of “program
                        personnel” deserve specific mention.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">In the first place</hi>, there are the technical assistance
                        personnel who constitute, in the under-developed countries, the most
                        crucial, or at least an indispensable, part of the entire program and, in
                        the developed areas, a vital, if much smaller, portion of our aid. Without
                        such technicians, there can be no <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>
                        program, for the supplies and equipment which are also provided, no matter
                        how large in amount, are in general either incidental to, or dependent for
                        their effectiveness upon, such technicians. Therefore, any restriction on
                        the planned recruitment of, or any cutback in the present levels of, this
                        type of personnel is tantamount to a reduction in, or the abandonment of,
                        the program itself. Personnel, military and civilian, employed by the Armed
                        Forces to provide training to foreign nationals fall in the same
                        category.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">In the second place</hi>, there are the large numbers of
                        individuals who are employed by the Department of Defense in arsenals and
                        rehabilitation centers and who are engaged in the manufacture or repair of
                        military equipment designed for shipment to our allies. Reductions in these
                        categories are, unless the same production is transferred to private
                        facilities under contract, the equivalent of reductions in physical volume
                        of end-items made available as foreign aid.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Finally</hi>, there are the workers in depots, ports, etc.,
                        who are engaged in the physical processing of <gloss target="#t_MDAP1"
                            >MDAP</gloss> equipment—its inspection, packing, crating and
                        transportation. Obviously, cutbacks here mean a decrease in shipments of
                        available equipment—a program reduction.</p>
                    <p>I labor the foregoing distinction, not to prejudge the question of whether
                        reductions in actual, or planned increases in program personnel are
                        desirable, but rather to emphasize that this question is a program, and not
                        a personnel, question; that it must be handled as part of the issue of the
                        kind and level of foreign aid programs which the U.S. is committed to and/or
                        should conduct, and not by the automatic application of the kind of criteria
                        and standards set forth under the personnel category of your February 3
                        letter. We have followed this distinction in the actions taken pursuant to
                        your letter, as my summary report thereof below will indicate.</p>
                    <p>Two other special points relating to what can properly be described as
                        administrative personnel warrant brief, passing mention. <hi rend="italic"
                            >First</hi>, a large number of the individuals who are employed overseas
                        in an administrative capacity are paid in local currency which is either
                        contributed by the host government or accrues to the United States as
                        counterpart. Thus, at least in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953, an
                        important <pb n="607" xml:id="pg_607" facs="0633"/>share of employment
                        expenses is met from sources other than appropriated funds, and their
                        elimination would not represent any net saving in appropriated funds.
                        Moreover, although it can be said that counterpart represents an asset of
                        the United States Government that might be used for other purposes, now or
                        in the future, thereby eliminating the need for certain dollar
                        appropriations which would otherwise be required, this is not the case with
                        contributed currency. To the extent that an expense covered by contributed
                        currency is eliminated, the currency contribution is reduced, providing the
                        U.S. with no net saving. <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, it should be
                        observed that the Mutual Security Program is administered under a
                        Congressionally imposed personnel ceiling, a ceiling that has been
                        progressively reduced in successive sessions of the Congress. In other
                        words, Congress has, by law, already effected two substantial cutbacks in
                        personnel allowed for the administration of the program. I emphasize that I
                        cite these special points, not to prejudge the question of the extent to
                        which overhead savings may be accomplished without program damage, but
                        rather to place the problem of <gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss> personnel
                        in proper perspective.</p>
                    <p>B. <hi rend="italic">As to construction</hi>—</p>
                    <p>Since it is my understanding that your instructions with respect to
                        construction have no specific application to construction currently being,
                        or proposed to be, carried out under the control of foreign governments
                        and/or international organizations, even though U.S. local currency and/or
                        dollar aid is directly or indirectly involved in its financing, compliance
                        with such instructions creates no special problems for the Mutual Security
                        program, and the standards and criteria suggested by you can be, and have
                        been, applied literally to the minor U.S. construction projects with which
                        the Program is occasionally concerned.</p>
                    <p>C. <hi rend="italic">As to programs</hi>—</p>
                    <p>The essential feature of your instructions with respect to <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 programs, apart from the general
                        injunction “to eliminate unnecessary programs and to hold the remainder to
                        minimum levels,” was the direction to “permit no increases over the January
                        rate of obligations except on complete justification and specific approval
                        unless such increases are clearly necessary to meet requirements fixed by
                        law.” Although, because of the specific escape clause, literal compliance
                        with this direction has not presented, and does not now present, any
                        problem, it is nonetheless important to bring out, as I know you recognize,
                        that the standard employed—“no increases over the January rate of
                        obligations”—bears no mechanical relation to the nature of the Mutual
                        Security Program and is not the kind of yardstick that is helpful in
                        endeavoring to effect an intelligent retrenchment in that program. It can
                        only be applied in <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0634"/>the kind of
                        program (a) that has a reasonably definite monthly pattern of obligations
                        and expenditures (whether that pattern be one of increasing, decreasing or
                        level obligations and expenditures), and (b) in which the month of January
                        is reasonably typical. In the case of most components of the Mutual Security
                        Program neither of these conditions apply and, in addition, the situation is
                        complicated by the existence, with respect to a large portion of unobligated
                        Mutual Security funds, of international commitments. Obligations are not
                        incurred at a relatively even monthly rate, as in the case of agencies where
                        the principal expenditures are for personnel, recurrent supplies of a
                        standard nature, and the furnishing of continuing services of a relatively
                        static character; they fluctuate, and must in the nature of the program
                        fluctuate, from month to month as will be illustrated below. It is almost
                        pure happenstance as to whether the rate of obligations in any particular
                        month will be many times more, or much less, than the average rate of
                        monthly obligations for the year as a whole. January 1953 was, in fact,
                        because of large deobligations, less typical than even the very untypical
                        usual month, although Appendix B, which shows the obligations for the major
                        program components in January, nevertheless illustrates the general point.
                        The following paragraphs indicate, program by program, why the foregoing
                        situation obtains.</p>
                    <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Military Assistance</hi>—In the military assistance
                        program, most obligations, except relatively small ones for training, fall
                        into two major categories—procurement (including rehabilitation and repair);
                        and accessorial (packing, handling, crating and transportation). The second
                        of these is entirely determined by the volume of goods which, in any given
                        month, are being prepared for, or are in the process of, shipment. This
                        volume is in turn fixed by the rate of production under material contracts
                        placed many months, and often years, previously, and by the system of
                        allocation. Thus, except as decisions are made not to deliver finished goods
                        or to cancel existing procurement contracts, actions taken now, or during
                        the remainder of this fiscal year, can have no significant effect on the
                        predetermined rate of obligation in this category until 18 to 24 months
                        hence.</p>
                    <p>It is, therefore, obligations under the first category, i.e., for
                        procurement, which represent the key factor. The volume of such obligations
                        in any given month is affected, in the same manner as procurement
                        obligations for our own military departments, by the general pattern of
                        service procurement, a pattern which traditionally, whether necessarily and
                        wisely or not, finds obligations peaking in the latter months of a fiscal
                        year as funds made available by the Congress are gradually translated into
                        contracts. Obligations in the summer and fall are small, and in the spring
                        large; in a winter month, such as January, their rate may or may not,
                        depending on the chance placement in that month of a number of large
                        contracts, represent a theoretical average monthly rate adequate to obligate
                        the total annual appropriation. Even if, by coincidence, it <pb n="609"
                            xml:id="pg_609" facs="0635"/>should approximate this theoretical
                        average, it has no meaning as a sensible norm to measure or control actual
                        obligations in subsequent months since, by hypothesis, the greatest portion
                        of the annual appropriation will still remain unobligated on February 1. For
                        example, if January had in fact produced an obligation rate equal to
                        approximately one-twelfth of the annual appropriation, or slightly under
                        $400 million, a continuation of such rate through the remaining 5 months
                        would have resulted in a June 30 unobligated balance of over a billion
                        dollars.</p>

                        previously made by the Executive branch of this Government subject only to
                        (a) the appropriation of funds by the Congress and (b) certain special
                        conditions such as demonstrated operating requirements of the international
                        agency and matching contributions by other nations. Such contributions are
                        not normally prorated evenly on a monthly basis over the whole fiscal year;
                        on the contrary, their timing is most uneven and almost wholly determined by
                        factors which are beyond the control of the United States, principally the
                        phasing of the requirements of the international organization and of
                        matching contributions by others. Hence the rate of obligation (and the act
                        of contribution usually is the act of obligation) in a particular month,
                        such as January, constitutes no intelligent standard whatsoever for
                        determining an appropriate level for the annual program or the rate of
                        obligation which is proper in succeeding months. Moreover, even if the
                        contrary were the case, the fact of the matter is that previously planned
                        contributions represent, to the extent that (1) they are covered by pledges
                        and (2) the conditions attached to those pledges are not, international
                        commitments of the U.S. Government.</p>
                    <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>
                        Program</hi>—Under the <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> programs, it is
                        the customary procedure to inform other nations of the approximate level of
                        aid (new obligational authority) which they can anticipate will be made
                        available during the course of a fiscal year. Sometimes this advice is
                        conveyed at the outset of the year, but more normally each nation is first
                        informed of an initial base figure and then, subsequently, if this base
                        figure is to be increased, of one or more increments thereto which bring the
                        total up to the annual level finally determined to be proper by the U.S.
                        Government. While advice as to a base figure and increments thereto does not
                        constitute an obligation in the technical sense, it does represent a kind of
                        international commitment and, in addition, becomes an important basis for
                        planning and budgeting by the prospective recipient. Subsequently,
                        allotments are made and procurement authorizations are issued against these
                        allotments. The procurement authorization normally constitutes the
                        obligating document. The timing of allotments and of procurement
                        authorizations for any country is affected by a great variety of
                        considerations, the most important being related to the general foreign
                        exchange requirements or foreign exchange program of the country in
                        question. They are not evenly <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0636"
                        />spread among the twelve months of the year, and no single month can be
                        taken as an appropriate base against which to determine the level during
                        succeeding months. To say that obligations should not exceed the level in a
                        particular month might, therefore, depending on the accidents surrounding
                        that level, require the repudiation of international commitments, or,
                        conversely, establish a rate for future monthly obligation in excess of
                        available appropriations. This statement is borne out by reference to
                        Appendix B. Although, on January 31, 1953, nearly $1 billion of the total
                        defense support appropriation for Title 1 of $1.28 billion had been made the
                        subject of international commitments, only $480 million had been obligated.
                        Maintenance of the January rate of obligation during the succeeding five
                        months would therefore have entailed, to mention the least of the
                        consequences, the repudiation of international commitments of perhaps $330
                        million, and a failure to take care of other urgent requirements which, for
                        one reason or another, had not then yet become firm international
                        commitments.</p>
                    <p>(4) <hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>
                        Program</hi>—Under <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> programs, obligations
                        are made in a number of different ways, none of which (except those for
                        certain types of personnel or training in countries where programs have
                        stabilized) reflect themselves in even monthly rates of obligation. On the
                        contrary, a very substantial portion of all obligations are made through
                        program or project agreements with foreign governments, or by contributions
                        to joint funds, and these acts of obligation are not spread uniformly
                        throughout the year. Such obligations result in large measure from
                        international negotiations, the timing of which is [illegible], and the
                        January level, or the level for any other month, may be very high or very
                        low in terms of a rate which, if projected evenly throughout the year, would
                        utilize the full amount appropriated. It therefore represents a meaningless
                        norm against which to make judgments about the appropriate total of
                        obligations during the balance of the fiscal year or about the desirable
                        monthly level of obligations during each [<hi rend="italic">such?</hi>]
                        period. It should also be noted, in the case of <gloss target="#t_TCA1"
                            >TCA</gloss> programs, that in certain countries a program is newly
                        authorized, or in any event is newly getting under way, and, as such, unless
                        the very nature of the program itself were to be revised, must necessarily
                        be the subject of somewhat increased obligations.</p>
                    <p>I believe the foregoing analysis of the major <gloss target="#t_MSA1"
                            >MSA</gloss> operations indicates two things which have been of
                        overriding importance in the review by this office and the participating
                        agencies of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 program: <hi
                            rend="italic">first</hi>, that many of our obligations result from prior
                        international commitments, and that failure to make such obligations would
                        represent a violation of those commitments and have the most profound
                        political and economic consequences abroad; and, <hi rend="italic"
                            >second</hi>, that the nature of the component programs is such that the
                        obligation level in any given month often bears little relation to the
                        annual program level and cannot be used intelligently as a norm against
                        which to determine the proper yearly total or the subsequent monthly level
                        of obligations. The real question has had <pb n="611" xml:id="pg_611"
                            facs="0637"/>to be whether it made sense, and whether it was possible,
                        given the history of commitments and obligations during the fiscal year to
                        February 3, to reduce a total annual program from the level previously
                        planned. This is the approach which we have taken. If, as to any component
                        of the program, the decision to reduce can be made, then the obligation
                        pattern for that program must be tailored to such reduction and not
                        artificially [pegged?] by reference to a January rate that in no way relates
                        to the problem.</p>

                        the spirit of the instructions contained in your letter of February 3, 1953.
                        These letters also (1) dealt with improved management as a key to greater
                        efficiency and savings; (2) required, even as to “program personnel”, the
                        application of the criteria contained in your instructions in all cases
                        where this would not require, pending a program review, a change in the
                        level of program execution; and (3) established reporting procedures
                        covering the implementation of the new policies wherever existing procedures
                        appeared inadequate. Since I believe these letters speak for themselves, I

                        significant actions which have been taken or are now in process. In the
                        first place, we plan to move rapidly, once we have fully digested their
                        reports, to make those reductions in personnel, and those savings from
                        improved administration and operating procedures which have been suggested
                        as possible by the Evaluation Teams which have recently returned from
                        overseas. As you know, I have always felt that a major reduction in force in
                        our missions abroad could only be intelligently effected after, and in
                        accordance with the findings of, a thorough on-the-spot survey by a really
                        competent group of experts. We will now decide, based upon the surveys
                        already made, the extent to which the same or similar techniques should be
                        employed to review the situation in countries which were not covered by the
                        recent evaluation. In the second place, we have been intensively reviewing,

                    <p>We have now received the required information and forms from all of the
                        participating agencies except the Department of Defense. Since we have no
                        reliable estimate as to when submissions from the latter department may be
                        forthcoming, we are making, as I understand you desire, a partial report
                        covering the balance of the program.</p>
                    <p>Attached hereto, as Appendix D, is a copy of a memorandum, dated February 6,
                        1953, covering the status of programs of the Mutual Security Agency as of
                        February 3, 1953. I concur in the conclusions set forth therein as to those
                        items which are indicated as constituting firm international commitments,
                        the abrogation of which has, after review, appeared in most instances to be
                        contrary to fundamental U.S. security interests. Moreover, since the date of
                        that memorandum, it has become also apparent that the minimum requirements
                        of <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> programs will probably dictate the
                        complete, or substantially complete, obligation of all available funds
                        before the end of this fiscal year, except (a) those tentatively planned for
                        one country, the Philippines, where it will be possible, unless emergency
                        requirements elsewhere intervene, to carry over at least $5 million, and
                        perhaps more, of the new obligational authority which had previously been
                        planned for utilization there by June 30, 1953, and, (b) possibly, a portion
                        of those funds currently earmarked for basic materials development in Title
                        III. While it is true, insofar as Title I is concerned, (1) that a few
                        programs are not yet entirely firm (Section 118(k) programs for France,
                        Italy and Austria, as examples), (2) that full utilization of funds
                        presently reserved for a number of special activities, such as basic
                        materials, may not occur, and (3) that a small amount has not yet been
                        distributed among a number of competing demands, we face a situation in
                        which the urgency of meeting certain as yet unfilled and unprogrammed
                        requirements may prove to be so great (drought relief in <pb n="613"
                            xml:id="pg_613" facs="0639"/>Yugoslavia and additional aid to France, as
                        examples) that not only would any possible savings resulting from the
                        foregoing three sources be absorbed but, in addition, U.S. security
                        interests would necessitate the transfer of some <gloss target="#t_MDAP1"
                            >MDAP</gloss> funds for defense support. Moreover, it has been assumed
                        that the [$.15?] million which must, under the law, be reserved for Spain
                        out of the total <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss>-defense support
                        appropriation for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953, would be funded,
                        if <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 funding is required, from <gloss
                            target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> appropriations. As a matter of current
                        interest, since the figures on this subject have been constantly
                        fluctuating, I attach hereto, as Appendix E, the latest summary of planned
                        utilization of the Title I <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>
                        appropriation.</p>
                    <p>Attached hereto as Appendix F is a memorandum from the Department of State,
                        dated February 11, 1953, covering the status, as of February 1, 1953, of
                        programs conducted under the supervision of the Department of State,
                        exclusive of <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> programs. This memorandum
                        indicates that, as of that date, because of either international commitments
                        or requirements, reductions in previously planned <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1953 programs did not appear possible except tentatively as
                        follows: (1) <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_UNKRA1"
                        >UNKRA</gloss></hi>—$44 million, an amount which it would be necessary to
                        carry forward into <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 to meet
                        commitments undertaken in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953; (2)
                        [illegible]—$.7 million; and (3) <hi rend="italic">Ocean Freight
                            subsidies</hi>—$.26 million. This office concurred in that conclusion,
                        and believes that subsequent developments have not materially altered this
                        picture or indicated that further savings might be effected. You should
                        note, moreover, the statement contained in Appendix F with respect to
                        requirements (subsequently adjusted downward in one case) for supplemental
                        funds to cover amounts authorized, but not appropriated, for [<hi
                            rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_UNTA1">UNTA</gloss>?</hi>] and <gloss
                            target="#t_UNICEF1">UNICEF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Attached hereto as Appendix G, is an analysis (prepared in this office on the
                        basis of materials submitted by <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>) of the
                        status of <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> programs, other than the
                        program for Israel, as of the beginning of February, 1953. Since each one of
                        the <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> programs represents a different type
                        of problem, the details of which are inappropriate for discussion in this
                        letter, my staff would be glad to inform your representatives of the
                        premises on which this analysis was based, as well as to explain the factors
                        which, even at the end of January, made the status of certain funds in the
                        “balance” columns very uncertain. Today, some eight weeks since this
                        analysis was prepared, it seems probable, due to certain lags in the planned
                        hiring of technicians, that, without violating international commitments, it
                        may be possible to save, and carry over into <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1954, several million dollars of the total amount shown in
                        the “balance” column on the summary sheet. In the case of Israel it is
                        clear, as <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0640"/>you have been advised by
                        separate memorandum, that the entire amount appropriated is required for
                        obligation in this fiscal year.</p>
                    <p>There are also attached, as Appendix H, the forms, as prepared by the Mutual
                        Security Agency and the Department of State, which your letter requested.
                        While, in general, insofar as <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 is
                        concerned, the figures contained therein are reconcilable with those
                        available to this office and, in addition, consistent with the statements
                        contained in the previous paragraphs, certain minor discrepancies will be
                        noted. These discrepancies result from small differences in judgment as to
                        the amounts which can effectively be obligated, and should be obligated, for
                        several programs during the balance of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1953.</p>
                    <p>In concluding this section I should state that this office, as well as the
                        participating agencies, have been governed in our review by a number of
                        considerations that cannot be stressed too often and which have made
                        inadvisable decisions which, under other circumstances, might have been
                        entirely practical.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">In the first place</hi>, we have been faced, as previously
                        indicated, by the existence of international commitments which, on February
                        3, 1953, covered the great bulk of funds available for defense support and
                        economic aid and, in a less precise fashion, most of our military assistance
                        money as well. In my opinion, the abrogation of any of these commitments
                        would have been, and still remains, unwise, and I reach this judgment
                        irrespective of whether one should conclude, in retrospect, and I think
                        would seldom be the case, that the commitments should not have been made in
                        the first instance.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">In the second place</hi>, and probably of paramount
                        importance, has been the fact that pending a review of all our national
                        security policies and objectives, and of the priorities to be accorded each,
                        there have been no standards which could serve as guideposts in redirecting
                        or sharply reducing programs which were, at least when they were formulated,
                        directly responsive to national security policies and objectives which then
                        existed. Therefore, except where increased efficiency or operating and
                        personnel savings have been involved, we have been confronted with the
                        dilemma posed by two alternative courses of action; first, to run the risk
                        of creating a future expenditure level and pattern which might be slightly
                        more difficult to cope with from a fiscal standpoint than the level and
                        pattern of expenditures which may ultimately emerge as an objective from the
                        current <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> review; or, second, to incur the
                        grave dangers implicit in the premature cutback of any program which, as a
                        result of such review, it is decided should have been continued at previous
                        levels. The first course has seemed far wiser in most cases since choice of
                        the second course could result in irreparable damage to our national
                        security. Certainly, there has appeared to <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615"
                            facs="0641"/>be no possible justification, in advance of new policies,
                        for taking any action which would forfeit or slow the painfully achieved
                        momentum of going programs or for accepting unnecessarily if previous
                        policies and objectives should later be reaffirmed, the very serious
                        political and economic consequences which might result from severe program
                        retrenchments and from the apparent changes in U.S. foreign policy that such
                        retrenchments would be likely to imply. The acceptance of consequences of
                        this character must represent a conscious decision at the highest level of
                        government and is, in fact, the very issue with which the National Security
                        Council is seized today.</p>

                    <p>There have heretofore been transmitted to you, in accordance with the
                        provisions of your February 3rd letter, new submissions prepared by the

                        submissions is now complete with one major exception—the final

                        covering the Mutual Security Program in its entirety. These will be
                        forthcoming as soon as I have received, and had the opportunity to study,

                    <p>The security and welfare of the Nation have become increasingly and
                        critically dependent on the successful conduct of our foreign affairs in all
                        its aspects: political, military, economic, and psychological. In the
                        conduct of our foreign policies and programs, it is not enough simply to
                        react to developments as they occur; it is imperative that all our material
                        and intellectual resources and skills be harnessed to the formulation and
                        execution of positive and effective efforts designed to achieve the National
                        goals.</p>
                    <p>The organization of the Federal Government for this task can be materially
                        strengthened.</p>
                    <p>The Committee considers it of the highest importance that the Secretary of
                        State have sole responsibility (subject to the President) for the
                        formulation and control of foreign policy and that he be freed from foreign
                        program operations in order that he may concentrate on his primary
                        function.</p>
                    <p>The foreign policy primacy of the Secretary of State should be maintained
                        through clear Presidential mandate and through the President’s consistent
                        practice of employing the Secretary of State as the Executive’s channel of
                        authority on foreign policy questions. This relationship should, of course,
                        be sustained on specific issues by the President.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, within the framework of foreign policy, the Secretary of
                        Defense (subject to the President) should have clear primacy in the
                        formulation and direction of military policy.</p>
                    <p>The Committee considers that to achieve this clarity of responsibility and to
                        assure the proper coordination and execution of our foreign operations, it
                        is essential that there be a single agency in which all foreign assistance
                        and economic operations, to the greatest degree practicable, shall be
                        centralized or coordinated, and that a similar consolidation be effected in
                        the administration of the foreign information programs. These agencies
                        should exercise their functions subject to foreign policy as determined by
                        the Secretary of State, and military policy as determined by the Secretary
                        of Defense.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, the following steps are recommended: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    <p>At the present time, foreign assistance and economic operations are widely
                        dispersed among numerous government agencies. The result is waste, confusion
                        of purpose, and often ineffective action. The proposals contained in this
                        memorandum are designed to improve this situation by centralizing or
                        coordinating in a single agency, so far as practicable, the most important
                        of our foreign assistance and economic operations.</p>
                    <p>The Committee suggests that the new agency be known as the “International
                        Cooperation Administration” The Director for Mutual Security would prefer
                        that it be named “Mutual Security Operations Administration”.</p>
                    <p>Since the new agency would replace the Mutual Security Agency, this
                        recommendation of the Committee would not result in an increase in the
                        number of Government agencies.</p>

                    <p>Following preliminary hearings in the House of Representatives in March 1953
                        on extension of the Mutual Security program, President Eisenhower on May 5
                        recommended to Congress the passage of legislation extending the program.
                        The basic purpose of the program was characterized by the President as
                        “simply the long-term security of the United States living in the shadow of
                        the Soviet threat.” The President requested approximately $5,250 million for
                        military weapons and support to aid the defense efforts of friends and
                        allies, and approximately $550 million for technical, economic, and
                        developmental purposes. The total request represented a reduction of
                        approximately $1.8 billion from the Truman Administration’s <pb n="626"
                            xml:id="pg_626" facs="0652"/>projected mutual security budget. For the
                        text of the President’s message, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the
                            Presidents of the United States: Dwight D. Eisenhower</hi>, 1953, pages
                        256–259.</p>
                    <p>Both Secretary Dulles and Mutual Security Director Harold Stassen testified
                        before a joint session of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the
                        House Foreign Affairs Committee on May 5. During the course of his remarks,
                        the Secretary stated that “A main objective of the program is to get the
                        most security for the least cost”. He also observed that a large part of the
                        total amount was being requested for defense of the European area within the
                        framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and that the most
                        careful planning had gone into the formulation of the request. “There is no
                        ‘water’ in this program to be squeezed out without taking greater risks than
                        we believe are acceptable at the present time”, he stated in connection with
                        the European portion of the proposed program.</p>
                    <p>Stassen, in his testimony, stated that the program before the two Committees
                        “represents the product of months of work by the National Security Council
                        where each of our security objectives was carefully studied and its
                        importance weighed in relation to the fiscal considerations” that so greatly
                        concerned Secretary of the Treasury George Humphrey. The testimony of
                        Secretary Dulles and Mutual Security Director Stassen is printed in the

                        736–742.</p>
                    <p>Senate hearings on the Mutual Security bill took place in the latter half of
                        May. Those hearings are printed in U.S. Senate, <hi rend="italic">Hearings

                    <p>On May 27, President Eisenhower reduced his initial request by $354 million.
                        On June 16, the House Foreign Affairs Committee reported <gloss
                            target="#t_HR1">H.R.</gloss> 5710 authorizing $5 billion. Subsequently,
                        the full House passed the bill after rejecting all amendments proposing
                        further reductions but agreeing to an amendment by Representative Fulton
                        (R.–Pa.) requiring disposal of surplus agricultural commodities wherever
                        possible. The Senate version of the Mutual Security bill, approved on July
                        1, authorized a grant of $5.3 billion. A conference report fixing the final
                        Mutual Security appropriation was approved July 13 by both Houses.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Rand</hi>: The results of the 1954 special
                        budget review fall substantially short of the administration’s budgetary
                        objectives.</p>
                    <p>Accomplishment was limited by the short time within which the review had to
                        be made, the inherited commitments, the inflexible requirements of
                        legislation controlling many programs of substantial cost, and the review
                        taking place coincident with the problems of establishing new administrative
                        organizations. Consequently the reductions which it was possible to propose
                        to Congress represented only the first estimate of what can be accomplished
                        and cannot be accepted as satisfactory goals for actual results in the 1954
                        fiscal year.</p>
                    <p>To achieve the budgetary objectives, every possibility of further reductions
                        in expenditures must be explored. Actual expenditures for 1954 have to be
                        brought well below the levels contemplated in the revised budget, and
                        projected expenditures for fiscal year 1955 will have to be reduced still
                        more. The job has only begun—it is not done.</p>
                    <p>Judgment on progress will be predicated on progressive reductions in the rate
                        of expenditure and the level of government employment. These two measures of
                        accomplishment will be receiving constant public attention.</p>
                    <p>In the policy letter of February 3, 1953,<note n="2" xml:id="d178fn2"><hi
                                rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_569">p. 569</ref>.</note>
                        each department and agency head was asked to consider eliminating all
                        unnecessary programs and reducing or holding the remainder to minimum
                        levels. It is essential that you give this review your active and continued
                        personal attention.</p>
                    <p>Further substantial savings primarily will result from the continuous
                        examination of existing programs and activities in terms of elimination,
                        consolidation, and simplification. There are many areas in which immediate
                        administrative action can be taken to accomplish changes resulting in
                        reductions in expenditures where no change in existing legislation is
                        necessary. There are others in which changes can and should be made to
                        accomplish budgetary savings that will require changes in legislation. In
                        the latter case, proposals for these changes in legislation should be
                        submitted to <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0654"/>the Bureau of the
                        Budget as promptly as possible for appropriate clearance.</p>
                    <p>The results of the initial review of the fiscal year 1954 budget should be
                        used to the maximum extent possible in preparation of the fiscal year 1955
                        budget estimates. In the review, many areas of future savings were
                        identified which could not be made immediately effective because they will
                        require negotiation not possible within the time limits involved or require
                        changes in legislation. Action to implement these possibilities should
                        receive prompt consideration and there should be added to them any further
                        possibilities which have been or can be developed.</p>
                    <p>You are reminded that under the normal budgetary process the preparation for
                        development of the fiscal year 1955 budget will begin immediately. This will
                        include an appraisal of the projected budgetary situation, a determination
                        of objectives, the tentative assumptions and policies related to their
                        accomplishment, and the analyses preliminary to establishing fiscal year
                        1955 ceilings for new obligational authority and expenditures. These are
                        prepared for submission to the President as a preliminary to advising heads
                        of the departments and agencies of the considerations governing the
                        preparation of their fiscal year 1955 budget.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                    <p>In a Special Message to Congress of June 1, 1953, President Eisenhower
                        transmitted Reorganization Plan No. 7 of 1953 relating to the establishment
                        of the Foreign Operations Administration. In a separate message to Congress
                        on that day, the President stated that his aim in establishing the new
                        agency was “to centralize further the foreign assistance and related
                        economic responsibilities” of the Executive Branch of the United States
                        Government. In implementing this reorganization, he continued, “I am taking
                        certain administrative actions. These include the transfer from the
                        Secretary of State to the Director of the Foreign Operations Administration
                        four responsibilities: the administration of the Act for International
                        Development; assistance to private foreign relief organizations; programs
                        for aiding persons who have escaped from Communist areas; and operating
                        functions with respect to United States participation in the United Nations
                        Technical Assistance Program, the United Nations International Children’s
                        Emergency Fund, the United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency, and the
                        Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration.” He further stated <pb
                            n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0655"/>that “Reorganization Plan No. 7 of
                        1953 provides for abolishing the offices of Special Representative in Europe
                        and Deputy Special Representative in Europe, as authorized by section 504 of
                        the Mutual Security Act of 1951, as amended. I am establishing a new United
                        States mission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and European
                        regional organizations. The chief of the mission will report to and receive
                        instructions from the Secretary of State. The mission will include
                        representatives of the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Treasury
                        and the Director of the Foreign Operations Administration.”</p>
                    <p>In further explanation of his actions and aims, the President circulated a
                        “Memorandum on the Organization of the Executive Branch for the Conduct of
                        Foreign Affairs”, dated June 1, 1953, to the Heads of all Executive
                        Departments and to the Director of Mutual Security. In this memorandum, the
                        President stated, <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>, “The over-all foreign
                        affairs reorganization which I desire to achieve is designed to emphasize
                        the primary position of the Secretary of State within the executive branch
                        in matters of foreign policy. … It will be my practice to employ the
                        Secretary of State as my channel of authority within the executive branch on
                        foreign policy. Other officials of the executive branch will work with and
                        through the Secretary of State on matters of foreign policy. … The Secretary
                        of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the Treasury, as
                        appropriate, shall review plans and policies relative to military and
                        economic assistance programs, foreign information programs, and legislative
                        proposals of the Foreign Operations Administration and the United States
                        Information Agency [established simultaneously with the <gloss
                            target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> under Reorganization Plan No. 8] to assure
                        that in their conception and execution, such plans, policies and proposals
                        are consistent with and further the attainment of foreign policy, military
                        policy and financial and monetary policy objectives. The Director of the
                        Foreign Operations Administration and the Director of the United States
                        Information Agency will assure the concurrence or participation of the
                        appropriate Secretary before taking up with me any policy matters of concern
                        to that Secretary. The heads of these new agencies should furnish
                        information to the Secretaries of State, Defense, and Treasury in such
                        manner and form as may be agreed between the head of the agency and the
                        Secretary concerned to insure that the program of the agencies and the
                        implementation of such programs conform with foreign policy, military
                        policy, and financial and monetary policy objectives. To the maximum
                        feasible extent consistent with efficiency and economy, the internal
                        organization of the new agencies should be designed to permit ready
                        coordination with subordinate levels of the Department of State. This would
                        suggest parallel <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0656"/>areas of
                        responsibility for constituent units of the State Department and of the two
                        new operating agencies wherever feasible. … The Director of the Foreign
                        Operations Administration should take full advantage of the advice and
                        assistance available in other agencies. He should coordinate his operations
                        with related operations in other agencies. At the same time, I expect the
                        Director of the Foreign Operations Administration to maintain full control
                        and direction over all foreign economic and technical assistance programs
                        rather than turn this responsibility over to other agencies.”</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>As you know, present legislation provides for termination of the program on
                        June 30, 1954, with authority to expend funds for an additional year if such
                        funds were obligated before July 1, 1954 (this expenditure authority is one
                        year shorter than the period which applies to normal appropriations).</p>
                    <p>Our bill<note n="1" xml:id="d180fn1">Reference is presumably to the Mutual
                            Security Act of 1953. See the editorial note, <ref target="#pg_625">p.

                        30, 1958, and (b) that funds obligated before the termination date may be
                        expended during the three following years.</p>
                    <p>In the course of my testimony before the Foreign Affairs Committee on
                        Saturday, it became abundantly clear that Mr. Vorys was unalterably opposed
                        to any part of this provision and would wish termination clauses of the
                        present law to remain. His stated ground was that the Presidential documents
                        on the reorganization plan<note n="2" xml:id="d180fn2">See the editorial
                            note, <ref target="#d179"><hi rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note>
                        made a point of remarking on the present hodge-podge of legislation and that
                        the President considered it essential that a complete re-write of foreign
                        aid legislation be prepared for presentation to the next session of
                        Congress. (Although he did not say so, this <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631"
                            facs="0657"/>part of the Presidential message was inserted at Mr. Vorys’
                        insistence.) Mr. Vorys said that by keeping the present termination
                        provisions, he would be assured that such rewritten legislation would be
                        presented without fail.</p>
                    <p>This is an extremely serious matter, as I pointed out to the Committee
                            Saturday.<note n="3" xml:id="d180fn3">June 6.</note> Most contracts for
                        long-lead items which we are planning to let during fiscal ’54 will provide
                        for all or the major part of deliveries to be made after June 30, 1955, the
                        present expiration date of our authority to make expenditures. The
                        Hawker-Hunter contract is an outstanding example. If the termination
                        provisions are not amended, if contractors are at all willing to undertake
                        the risks of cancellation, we will have to pay a very substantially higher
                        price because of the risk of cancellation. In addition, the United States
                        would stand to lose progress and other payments made prior to
                        cancellation.</p>
                    <p>This might well be a subject which should be mentioned to Mr. Vorys at the
                        breakfast I understand he will have with the President tomorrow morning. For
                        purposes of our immediate problem, it would not be necessary to have both
                        the 1958 date and the three year expenditure provision, but it would be
                        necessary to have one or the other.</p>

                                    of defense forces in strategic locations. The fact that this
                                    conservative government has turned the adverse tide and is
                                    beginning to show some evidence of a more favorable economic
                                    build-up should not cause us to drop aid too abruptly. The
                                    program for 1954 drops from $400 million down to $200 million as

                            vis-à-vis the Soviet strength. We may also be within reach of developing

                            This, above all, is not the time to handcuff U.S. efforts. Even though

                    <p>While the total amount lacks about $670 million of the Administration’s
                        reduced appropriation request, it is considerably more than the original
                        figure passed by the House, and it is generally considered that the funds
                        appropriated are adequate to do an effective job.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Reaction Abroad to Cuts.</hi> During Congressional
                        consideration of both the authorizing and appropriation legislation,
                        considerable concern was manifest abroad about inadequate aid and about
                        future US aid plans. This was compounded in Europe because of the amendment
                        in the House version of the authorizing legislation which provided that not
                        less than 50% of the funds authorized for military assistance to Europe in
                        fiscal 1954 be made available only for the European Defense Community.
                        However, the bill as finally passed provides that 50% of the equipment and
                        material procured from fiscal 1954 military assistance funds for Europe
                        shall be transferred to the European Defense Community or to the countries
                        which become members thereof, unless the Congress, upon Presidential
                        recommendation, provides otherwise. Thus, should <gloss target="#t_EDC1"
                            >EDC</gloss> not come into being and should the President consider that
                        conditions might nevertheless warrant release of equipment and materials
                        earmarked for the organization, Congress would reconsider the provision.
                        Meanwhile, orders for equipment and materials may be placed under these
                        funds but delivery of the assistance will not take place until the
                        organization is formed. Because of the time required between placement of
                        orders and their manufacture and delivery, the amendment will probably not
                        have an appreciable effect on most items for a year or eighteen months.
                        Moreover, this limitation applies only to equipment and materials and not to
                        training and other services. We have taken the position with the <gloss
                            target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> countries that this provision should not
                        cause concern to European <pb n="636" xml:id="pg_636" facs="0662"/>countries
                        but be regarded as US interest in European unity and in the effective
                        defense of Europe.</p>
                    <p>As to concern abroad about future US aid plans, it is true the authorizing
                        legislation did not extend the termination date of June 30, 1954 for the
                        program as requested by the Executive Branch. However, the legislation did
                        extend the terminal date for deliveries and liquidation to June 30, 1956 for
                        economic assistance and to June 30, 1957 for military assistance and
                        issuance of investment guaranties. Termination dates are elements of US
                        legislation and do not necessarily imply future US policy. The June 30, 1954
                        date was maintained, according to the conference report, not because it was
                        believed that all forms of assistance to other nations would finally
                        terminate on that date, but because it was considered necessary that there
                        be a basic overhauling of the legislation dealing with foreign aid before
                        that date.</p>
                    <p>The cut in multilateral technical assistance, while not large in size, is
                        especially serious because of its probable impact on a highly-regarded
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> program and because it is damaging to
                        US prestige in the United Nations. The Administration had requested
                        $13,750,000 for this purpose for fiscal 1954 and $4,595,812 as a
                        supplemental appropriation for 1953. We had pledged the latter amount for
                        the 1953 <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> program, making the pledge
                        contingent upon Congressional appropriation of funds. As finally passed, the
                        bill appropriates only $9,500,000 for fiscal 1954 and eliminates entirely
                        the supplemental appropriation. The cut came at an extremely bad time as the
                        Economic and Social Council was convened in Geneva, where news of this
                        reduction in one of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>’s most successful
                        programs spread like wildfire. Moreover, it came immediately after
                        announcements by the USSR and Polish delegates that, for the first time,
                        their governments would make a contribution to the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> technical assistance program. In view of the legislative
                        history, it may be possible to fulfill the 1953 program and for the
                        Administration to request a supplemental appropriation for the amount
                        authorized but not appropriated.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Transfers of Funds.</hi> The authorizing legislation
                        permits the President to transfer up to 10% of the total of funds for
                        military assistance and defense support in Europe from one of these purposes
                        to the other in that area, and to transfer 10% of the funds available for
                        military or defense support and technical assistance in any one area to
                        other areas to be used for the same purpose. Balances of prior
                        appropriations may be included in the base on which such percentages are
                        computed. The President is authorized to use $100 million anywhere for any
                        purpose, if he determines that such use is important to the security of the
                        United States, provided no more than $20 million is used for any one
                        country.</p>
                    <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0663"/>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Surplus Agricultural Commodities.</hi> Section 550 of the
                        act provides that not less than $100 million and not more than $250 million
                        of any mutual security appropriations for fiscal 1954 should be used,
                        directly or indirectly, to buy surplus agricultural commodities. Legally it
                        is possible under this provision to use military end-item funds as well as
                        economic assistance and defense-support funds. The Mutual Security
                        Appropriation Act requires that, of this amount, at least $100 million come
                        from funds other than those authorized by Section 541 (economic assistance
                        and defense support in Europe, Formosa and Indochina). Agricultural
                        commodities sold under this section should not displace or substitute for
                        “usual marketing of US or friendly countries” to that country. The commodity
                        would be sold to the country for local currency and, to the extent
                        practicable, at maximum market price. Local currency funds thus received
                        would be put into a special US account to be used in specified ways, with
                        particular regard being given to use for military assistance, loans for
                        increased production of items including strategic materials, grants to
                        increase production for domestic needs, and purchases of materials needed
                        for stockpile in the US, and goods or services that could be used for
                        assistance to third countries.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, in a separate piece of legislation, Congress authorized the
                        President to furnish emergency assistance to friendly countries in meeting
                        famine or other urgent relief requirements, by using agricultural
                        commodities which have been accumulated by the Commodity Credit Corporation
                        under the domestic price support program. This aid may also be furnished to
                        friendly, needy populations, without regard to the friendliness of their
                        government, provided the commodities will be so distributed as to relieve
                        actual distress among such populations. Such aid is limited to $100 million
                        and the time limit for such programs is set at March 15, 1954. The cost of
                        ocean transportation of such products will either be borne by the receiving
                        country or come from its share of <gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>
                        aid.</p>
                    <p>Interagency discussions are now going on as to the implementation of both the
                        legislation for emergency famine assistance and Section 550 of the Mutual
                        Security Act.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Other Provisions.</hi> While the Benton and Moody
                        amendments of previous foreign aid bills are omitted in the new legislation,
                        the conference report reiterates the principles of the Benton amendment. It
                        states that it is the policy of Congress to encourage the efforts of other
                        free countries in fostering private enterprise, in discouraging monopolistic
                        practices, and in the strengthening of free labor unions, and to encourage
                        American private investment abroad.</p>
                    <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0664"/>
                    <p>Section 105 of the appropriation act provides that none of the funds nor any
                        of the counterpart funds generated as a result of assistance may be used to
                        make payments on the debts of any country, nor shall any of these funds be
                        expended for any purpose for which funds have been withdrawn by any
                        recipient country to make payment on their debts. This will be particularly
                        relevant to Israel, where, in the past, mutual security funds have been used
                        for refunding purposes.</p>
                    <p>The same section also provides that after September 1 none of the funds shall
                        be used to make up any deficit to the European Payments Union for any nation
                        of which a dependent area fails to comply with any treaty to which the US
                        and such dependent area are parties nor shall any of the counterpart funds
                        generated as a result of assistance under the act be made available to such
                        nation. This was aimed at the problem which exists between the US and France
                        with respect to treaty rights in Morocco. While it does not have any effect
                        on funds that are already obligated for aid to France, it may affect
                        counterpart generated by fiscal year 1953 funds in the event that some of
                        the funds already in the pipeline are de-obligated and re-obligated. The
                        Foreign Operations Administration still has not decided on the effect of
                        this provision on counterpart funds and has requested a legal opinion from
                        the Department on the treaty problem in Morocco.</p>
                    <p>A shipping provision in the appropriation act requires that insofar as
                        practical steps should be taken to assure that at least 50% of the gross
                        tonnage of commodities, procured within the US out of funds made available
                        under the act and transported abroad in ocean vessels, is transported on US
                        flag vessels to the extent such vessels are available at market rates.</p>
                    <p>The investment guaranty program was broadened in the hope of stimulating
                        greater investor participation. The terms were extended to 20 years and
                        guaranties can be made in countries not otherwise participating in the
                        mutual security program. Such guaranties may be issued until June 30,
                        1957.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Byroade referred to the favorable action of the 83rd Congress on the
                                <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> foreign aid program. He said
                            that what was done with the money appropriated for <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 54 would determine whether or not
                            Congress would act favorably on the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 55
                            program. He felt that if the situation in Iran and Egypt could be
                            stabilized, good progress could be made in the whole area. Mr. Byroade
                            tabled a memo showing preliminary <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>
                            projections on new authorizations for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>

                        <p>a. Greece and Turkey</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked why the Department should be responsible for
                            recommending the level of military aid. He felt that the foreign
                            military assistance program should be included in the Department of
                            Defense budget. He said that in some cases the decision as to whether or
                            not military assistance should be granted was more of a political
                            decision than a military one, but in the case of Greece and Turkey he
                            felt that Defense should have the primary responsibility for determining
                            and justifying the size of the military program.</p>
                        <p>b. Iran</p>
                        <p>In response to a question from the Secretary, Mr. Byroade said that
                            military assistance to Iran was both military and political. He said
                            that, if the situation in Iran stabilizes, then Iran could become a
                            vital part of the “northern tier”, in which case the Department of
                            Defense should determine the level of military aid to Iran.</p>
                        <p>c. Arab States</p>
                        <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0671"/>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether the Defense people would advocate military
                            aid to the Arab States on military grounds alone. Mr. Byroade doubted
                            that they would.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he felt the primary purpose of our military
                            assistance to the area was to maintain internal stability. He felt that
                            the possibility of invasion from without and of resisting successfully
                            such an invasion were less likely than in Europe. Mr. Byroade said that
                            this was exactly the line the executive agencies had taken during the
                            Congressional presentation of the 1954 program. He said that the Defense
                            Department had proposed a program in 2 phases: (1) sending small, but
                            effective, military missions to advise the military regimes in most of
                            that area. (2) The second phase would be the creation of a holding force
                            against outside aggression in which the favorable terrain would prove
                            most vital. He said that Congressional reception to this testimony had
                            been favorable but that domestic pressure had kept the size of the
                            program down.</p>
                        <p>d. Israel</p>
                        <p>Mr. Byroade pointed out the need to obtain more cooperation from the
                            Israelis. He said that as the Arab military forces become stronger, it
                            will be necessary for us to think about a military mission to
                            Israel.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MacArthur asked why we obtained no quid pro quo in Israel. Mr.
                            Byroade replied that there has been no grant military aid in Israel,
                            that we had permitted them to make purchases in the U.S., but that we
                            had also denied their request to purchase certain items. He said that he
                            did not favor grant aid to Israel other than infrastructure unless they
                            agreed to furnish us more information about the size and composition of
                            their forces.</p>
                        <p>e. Pakistan</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if the determination on military aid to Pakistan was
                            purely a military problem or if political factors were predominant. Mr.
                            Byroade said that it was necessary to consider the effect on India of
                            military assistance to Pakistan and that for this reason the Department
                            has been holding back on granting military aid to Pakistan. Mr. Byroade
                            said that the responsibility for justifying military assistance programs
                            has been a joint one shared by the Departments of State and Defense. The
                            Secretary said that it seemed to him that in the case of Iran and the
                            Arab States military assistance was a quasi-political matter.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Economic Assistance</hi></p>
                        <p>a. Greece and Turkey</p>
                        <p>Mr. Byroade said he would like to continue small economic assistance
                            programs in Greece and Turkey. In response to a question <pb n="646"
                                xml:id="pg_646" facs="0672"/>by the Secretary as to the relation of
                            the present economic programs in that area to defense, Mr. Gardiner felt
                            that economic assistance was necessary if Greece and Turkey were to
                            maintain their present levels of military effort. He added that the
                            Greek and Turkish soldiers were one of the “best buys” on the Defense
                            expenditure counter. Mr. Nolting felt that it would be easier to cut the
                            economic assistance programs to Greece and Turkey than the programs in
                            other <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> areas. Mr. Byroade said that
                            the figure for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 54 for Greece and
                            Turkey might have been too low had it not been for the “pipeline”. He
                            said that in the case of economic aid to Greece, Turkey and Israel, he
                            favored a reduction every year. He pointed out that <gloss
                                target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> would be responsible for the
                            Congressional presentation of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 55
                            economic assistance program. The Secretary asked if the Department
                            shouldn’t decide as a matter of policy on the desirable levels of
                            economic assistance. Mr. Byroade agreed and added that we should work
                            closely with Defense and <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> in
                            developing the program.</p>
                        <p>b. Reserve Contingencies</p>
                        <p>Mr. Byroade felt that the $50 million figure for “reserve contingencies”
                            would be easier to justify before the Congress if it were added in with
                            other figures under economic assistance such as the item for “special
                            economic assistance to the Arab States”. He referred to the difficulties
                            he had experienced in trying to justify the reserve contingency figure
                            in this year’s program.</p>
                        <p>c. “Carry-Over”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Nolting pointed out the difficulties involved in projecting
                            expenditures from year to year in economic and technical assistance
                            programs. He predicted a sizable carry-over in the <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 54 appropriations. Mr. Gardiner said that
                            we had been very frank with the Congress in this presentation. He said
                            that the only way for Congress to underwrite long term projects such as
                            dams was to appropriate money each year. It was felt that a project
                            should not be started until the required funds had been appropriated and
                            that, therefore, several years’ appropriations for a development project
                            might accumulate before the contracts were let. He pointed out that such
                            accumulation could not properly be called a carry-over.</p>
                        <p>d. India and Pakistan</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked about the level of economic assistance to India and
                            Pakistan. Mr. Byroade said that this was always a controversial item but
                            felt that a $200 million program for those countries would further the
                            interest of the U.S. in that area. In Mr. Byroade’s opinion our future
                            position in the Far East-South Asian area depends much more on India
                            than on Korea or China. The Secretary asked if we could buy this with
                            economic assistance to <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647" facs="0673"/>India.
                            Mr. Bowie asked what do we buy with economic assistance there.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Byroade replied that we were buying democracy in India. He said that
                            the next election would come in 1956 and that he would like to see the
                            present system and the present personality retained. He felt that India
                            would never go communist under Nehru in spite of the many difficulties
                            we have had with him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bowie asked what results could be obtained from economic assistance
                            that could not be obtained with investment capital. Mr. Waugh replied
                            that this was an academic question. Mr. Bowie said that it should be
                            possible to underwrite U.S. investments in that area and that it would
                            be better from a foreign relations standpoint to conceal grants as
                            loans. Mr. Byroade agreed that the sooner we could get out of the “grant
                            business” the better off we would be and the better our position in the
                            world would be. In response to a question by Mr. Bowie as to the use of
                            the grant aid, the Secretary said that in effect it was budgetary aid.
                            He illustrated this by describing the approach made by the Indian
                            Government during his trip to that area. Mr. Byroade pointed out that
                            they had over-simplified their approach and that there was a foreign
                            exchange factor involved. The Secretary said that he had asked the
                            Indians this question directly and that they had denied the importance
                            of the foreign exchange factor.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gardiner said that the Indians’ 5-year plan was being financed by (1)
                            the Indian Government, (2) the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>,
                            (3) sterling “draw-downs”, (4) countries supporting the Colombo
                                Plan,<note n="4" xml:id="d185fn4">The Colombo Plan for Cooperative
                                Economic Development in South and Southeast Asia was established in
                                January 1950 at a meeting in Colombo, Ceylon. Membership included
                                the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand,
                                Burma, Ceylon, India, Pakistan, Nepal, the Philippines, Thailand,
                                Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.</note> and (5) U.S. assistance. He said
                            that much of U.S. assistance was devoted to community development in the
                            villages, and that it was unlikely that private money would consider
                            investment in this type of project. Mr. Gardiner added that these
                            projects involving water resources were the type of project that are
                            sometimes considered in the U.S. to belong in the public, rather than in
                            the private, sector of the economy.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">“Soft Loan” Bank</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. Nolting suggested that, in view of the Congressional desire to
                            terminate economic assistance, some thought might be given to the
                            establishment of a “soft loan” U.S. corporation. This bank should
                            operate without the bankable loan requirements of the EX-IM Bank and the
                                <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>. The long run record of
                            repayments might not <pb n="648" xml:id="pg_648" facs="0674"/>be good
                            and there would be certain economic disadvantages, but Congress might be
                            willing to appropriate money for such a device that they would otherwise
                            be unwilling to authorize.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he had given some thought to this idea. He felt
                            that it would have the great advantage of flexibility. It would not be
                            necessary to justify each single item or project. He pointed out that
                            events do not always fall in line with the presentation of the program
                            to Congress and cited recent developments in Iran and Egypt as examples.
                            The Secretary said that another advantage of a soft loan bank would be
                            that it would permit the planning of long range projects, such as dams,
                            without relying on year to year appropriations by the Congress. The
                            Secretary pointed out, however, that from the standpoint of the Treasury
                            there is little distinction in the first instance between a withdrawal
                            for a loan and for a grant. Shifting over from grants to loans would
                            not, therefore, help Mr. Humphrey’s budget picture a great deal.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Mr. Waugh’s Views</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. Waugh favored the idea of separating military assistance from foreign
                            aid and said that Mr. Kalijarvi felt that foreign aid will have to be
                            reduced sharply and eliminated soon. Mr. Waugh said that his recent
                            travels around the country have convinced him that, if fiscal policies
                            are the administration’s number one problem, agricultural surpluses are
                            its number two problem. He said that we now have on hand a $3 billion
                            crop surplus with a prospect of a larger carry-over into the 1954 crop
                            year. He added that both parties are committed to price support
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Waugh referred to Henry Hazlitt’s recent article on foreign aid in
                                <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> and emphasized the need to separate
                            military, economic and technical assistance programs and to educate the
                            public on the distinction between the three and the advantages of each.
                            Mr. Waugh said that he had found almost no public opposition to defense
                            spending. He said that there were certain <gloss target="#t_FOA1"
                                >FOA</gloss> missions in countries where there were no programs to
                            justify such missions and added that these should be eliminated.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Conclusion</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. MacArthur said that the military assistance program should be
                            included in the Defense budget and should be justified on the grounds
                            that this program is one of our best investments in U.S. security. The
                            Congress and the people should be told that if we don’t spend these
                            dollars for <hi rend="italic">collective</hi> security it would be
                            necessary to spend <hi rend="italic">many more</hi> dollars on our own
                            defense system and would still not achieve the same degree of
                            security.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Byroade said that if Congressional support were to be obtained for
                            another year of foreign aid it would be necessary to <pb n="649"
                                xml:id="pg_649" facs="0675"/>reduce the present cost of
                            administering the program. He referred to Senator George’s comments
                            along these lines. Mr. Waugh said that Mr. Kalijarvi felt that Senator
                            Mansfield could be most useful in connection with next year’s foreign
                            aid program.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred again to the soft loan bank idea and said that the
                            repayments for such loans might prove to be much higher than we would
                            expect now. He said that production financed by such loans might one day
                            prove extremely useful to the U.S. A soft loan bank would remove the
                            “give-away” label from our foreign assistance programs. He said that
                            many Congressmen find it extremely difficult to answer their
                            constituents when they ask “Why not build roads and dams in your own
                            district rather than in India?”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Byroade asked if a soft loan bank might not reduce the demand for
                            sound bankable foreign loans. The Secretary said that such a soft loan
                            bank should be authorized to grant loans only to borrowers who had been
                            refused by the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and the EX-IM
                            Bank.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that this discussion had been useful for preliminary
                            thinking. He added that it would probably be necessary to scale down,
                            and perhaps shift the form of, the <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>
                            preliminary proposals.</p>

                            Indo-China and Japan that for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 he
                            visualized no appreciable cuts below this year’s appropriations figures
                            for the Far East.</p>

                        <p>In Indo-China, implementation of the anticipated stepped-up military
                            program calls for a <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 estimate of
                            about $1.5 billion. This figure compares with $1.3 billion granted for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954. Mr. Nolting said that $500
                            million allocated for end-items might be cut <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650"
                                facs="0676"/>back by Defense because of the amount of material in
                            the pipeline and presently on hand in Indo-China. The Secretary
                            questioned whether the increased tempo of military operations in
                            Indo-China did not make cuts in the end-item appropriations infeasible.
                            Mr. Johnson said that while expenditures for particular types of
                            equipment and services might vary with the situation, the total need is
                            expected to be of the same order of magnitude as in <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Japan</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. Johnson stated that the Japanese economy had received considerable
                            assistance from the $528 million dollar fund administered by the Defense
                            Department. Four Divisions of armed forces have already been equipped
                            and the available funds will go far toward establishing two additional
                            divisions. However, $75 million additional will be needed for a
                            six-division force and $175 million will be necessary to establish and
                            maintain the projected Japanese Air Force program. The projected
                            military program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 will require
                            the additional $150 million without considering any economic aid.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Economic Problems</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. Johnson noted that the Japanese had a $1.3 billion trade deficit last
                            year despite heavy dollar expenditure by the U.S. Japanese reserves run
                            about $1 billion. Mr. Bowie asked if this reserve was all in dollars.
                            Mr. Johnson said this figure represented a total reserve. To Mr. Waugh’s
                            question as to whether we could anticipate increased Japanese exports,
                            Mr. Johnson said that his best information indicated that at this time,
                            we could not. He added that the Japanese fiscal policy could stand
                            considerable tightening. The Secretary mentioned the difficulties he had
                            encountered in trying to convince Yoshida of the necessity of applying
                            necessary economic controls. Mr. Bowie asked to what extent trade with
                            Communist China could alleviate Japanese economic difficulties. Mr.
                            Johnson replied that according to his best figures, Japanese trade with
                            the China mainland before the war constituted only about 15% of the
                            total (or about $300 million per year). In reference to trade with the
                            UK, Mr. Johnson added that Japanese sterling balances were dropping at a
                            rate comparable to that of her dollar balance. Along this line Mr.
                            Johnson noted that wool imports to Japan are large, but there were raw
                            materials available on the islands for the development of a synthetic
                            fiber industry which in a relatively short period of time could be built
                            up to the point where wool imports could be reduced to a manageable
                            level. The question of financing such an industry was agreed to be
                            crucial in developing such a plan. Mr. Waugh said that the problem of
                            providing funds for economic development in Japan were scheduled to be
                            discussed at the <pb n="651" xml:id="pg_651" facs="0677"/>forthcoming
                            Board meeting of the International Bank. The Secretary added that the
                            Export-Import Bank would probably not be in a position to provide any
                            funds for a textile synthetics operation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Nolting asked for a run-down on the estimated cost for military
                            build-up. Mr. Johnson said $250 million plus the present Army fund
                            (totaling $778 million, of which $175 million is for the development of
                            air forces) is thought to be adequate for the proposed six divisions.
                            The force goal for Japan is 10 divisions. Mr. Johnson added that no
                            grant aid is contemplated, at this time, but noted that foreign exchange
                            reserves may be exhausted by late 1955. The Secretary asked if we were
                            doing all we should in regard to the Japanese financial situation. Mr.
                            Johnson suggested as a possible aid to dealing with economic problems
                            throughout the area, the establishment in the Department of the position
                            of Economic Coordinator for the Far East.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Economic Problems</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. Johnson said the U.S. is presently committed to a $300 million per
                            year program implementing the findings of the Tasca survey and an
                            additional $60 million for the U.S. share in UNKRRA.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that though the Korean aid program was presently
                            popular he could foresee a time—possibly within a year—when the
                            enthusiasm of the Japanese and Chinese Nationalists would diminish and
                            they would change their attitude toward aid to Korea. The Secretary
                            asked about the possibility of stopping the U.S. contribution to UNKRRA.
                            Mr. Johnson explained that one of the advantages in U.S. participation
                            in UNKRRA was that, although we bore the greater share of the expenses,
                            other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> nations contributed
                            approximately $55 million for Korean rehabilitation which might
                            otherwise not be available. It was generally agreed that at this time
                            contributions from other nations should be encouraged.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Military Support</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. Johnson said that a good part of the $300 million would go toward
                            defense support. The cost of the contemplated 20-division military force
                            for Korea was estimated at $750 million per year with an additional
                            $200–5$250 million per year for direct military costs. It is
                            contemplated also that if <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces
                            withdraw, they would leave a considerable amount of usable military
                            equipment for Korean troops, but that plans would have to be made to
                            replace this equipment as it was expended. To Mr. Bowie’s question as to
                            how many troops Korea could support without aid, it was the general
                            consensus that 5 divisions were the most that could be expected. <pb
                                n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0678"/>Mr. Waugh suggested the
                            possibility of having the Defense Department assume responsibility for
                            military assistance in Korea, but it was thought that, for two years at
                            least, the Department of State was committed to $350 million a year.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Formosa</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. Johnson stated that Formosa had received a generous grant this year
                            from the Congress—more than was requested by the Administration. He
                            anticipated for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 a military
                            program costing $300 million would be adequate to ensure the attainment
                            of the force goals for Formosa by the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1955. The force goals are (1) a 21-division force with
                            appropriate support and (2) a fleet of PT 5 surface vessels and (3) an 8
                            and ⅓ wing air force comprised of 4 and ⅓ wings of jet planes and 4
                            wings of non-jet aircraft. It is estimated that this force with the aid
                            of the Seventh Fleet would be adequate to secure Formosa against any
                            attack from the mainland but would not provide for any large-scale
                            operations on the mainland by the Nationalists. Mr. Johnson added that
                            Taipeh would undoubtedly continue to press for a 60-division force.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Economic Aid</hi></p>
                        <p>Economic aid program for Formosa is planned to consist of (1) economic
                            support of military expenditures and (2) economic development of the
                            country. For <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 the economic
                            development program would be limited to approximately 10% of the $70
                            million designated for economic aid. However, it is planned that the
                            economic development program would be increased gradually over the next
                            four to five years with the result that Formosa could be largely
                            self-sustaining except for direct military expenditures. Mr. Johnson
                            estimated that the $100 million a year defense expenditures would
                            continue indefinitely.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Other Countries</hi></p>
                        <p>It is anticipated that aid to Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia
                            will continue at modest levels, with economic aid principally in the
                            form of Point IV-type programs.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Summary</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. Johnson estimated $2.6 billion for economic and military aid to the
                            Far East, of which approximately one-half would be granted Indo-China.
                            The Secretary suggested that it would be ideal if the Department would
                            take the position in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> that State
                            would not request any money for Indo-China not approved by Defense. It
                            was generally agreed that political considerations over and above purely
                            military ones would probably limit the effective implementation of this
                            approach at this time.</p>

                        should have such an official title in all countries where they are
                        established as separate missions. I do feel, however, that in the case of

                        field staffs the current arrangements should continue. As you know, these
                        staffs are constituted as a part of the Diplomatic Mission, comparable to
                        the Diplomatic Mission-<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> arrangement.
                        While I believe that the <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>/<gloss

                        within the mission, these staffs should continue to be a part of the
                        Diplomatic Mission and should not be established as separate U.S. Operations

                        The present arrangement is one which the host countries are accustomed to
                        and the establishment of separate and additional missions may have
                        undesirable effects on our relationships with those countries. Furthermore,
                        by adhering to the existing relationship we will benefit <pb n="654"
                            xml:id="pg_654" facs="0680"/>from the several years of experience that
                        has been accumulated in the field, including the continuation of the
                        important contribution of the economic staffs of the Diplomatic Mission to
                        the <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss>
                        programs.</p>
                    <p>In view of our joint concern about the need to reduce U.S. staffs overseas to
                        the absolute minimum, we must develop arrangements which will permit
                        manpower talents overseas to serve both the Department of State and <gloss
                            target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>. In those countries where we are providing
                        special economic aid as well as technical assistance, I suggest that these
                        arrangements be predicated on the integration of our economic staffs under
                        the common leadership of an individual who would serve as principal Economic
                        Officer of Embassy and as Chief or Deputy Chief of your mission. Under this
                        arrangement you would be able to utilize the economic staffs which the State
                        Department now provides each Diplomatic Mission to work on economic analysis
                        and reporting, trade and investment opportunities and other related economic
                        activities. These staffs presently service all government agencies concerned
                        with foreign economic affairs. In countries receiving only technical
                        assistance, the economic section of the Diplomatic Mission should provide
                        such aid on economic matters as your staff may require and which is a normal
                        part of the Diplomatic Mission’s duties.</p>
                    <p>You will recall that last June, we agreed in principle that separate aid
                        missions should be closed out in countries where we are no longer furnishing
                        economic, technical or defense support assistance. It is now clear that in
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954, such aid is not contemplated for
                        Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal. I feel that we should now
                        proceed with the liquidation of those missions. Undoubtedly there will be
                        certain residual functions which must be continued during this and perhaps
                        the next fiscal year. These can be carried on by adding to the Embassies
                        certain of the personnel now with the separate <gloss target="#t_FOA1"
                            >FOA</gloss> missions. I believe in most cases fewer personnel will be
                        required than are contemplated for the separate <gloss target="#t_FOA1"
                            >FOA</gloss> missions, though it would be necessary to finance such
                        additional personnel as are needed from <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>
                        funds. You would, of course, continue to direct <gloss target="#t_FOA1"
                            >FOA</gloss> activities in these countries. I am sure we can work out
                        arrangements which will enable you to do so while liquidating the separate
                        missions whose major functions have come to an end.</p>

                        of September 28.<note n="1" xml:id="d187fn1"><ref target="#d186"><hi
                                    rend="italic">Supra</hi></ref>.</note> I am pleased that it is
                        your view that our proposed organization adheres to the plans of the
                        President’s reorganization message and the Rockefeller Committee Report, and
                        should facilitate close and effective working relationships at all levels
                        between our agencies and contribute to carrying out successfully this
                        Government’s foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the specific question you raise on <gloss target="#t_TCA1"
                            >TCA</gloss> field staffs, may I hasten to advise you that the
                        instructions to change all missions to United States Operations Missions
                        have already gone forward, as I had not heard of any difference on this
                        since I had forwarded the chart to you on August 25. May I comment further
                        that I do consider it quite essential for efficient administration for all
                        missions to take on certain new characteristics under President Eisenhower’s
                        Administration and for all missions to be closely coordinated under the
                        country team leadership of the Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>In the Far East area, for example, we have established the Regional
                        Directorship under Dr. Raymond Moyer, who is extremely competent and
                        experienced, and whose appointment I checked with Assistant Secretary
                        Robertson before concluding. The missions in Indonesia and Burma have been
                            <gloss target="#t_TCA1">TCA</gloss> missions. The missions in Thailand,
                        Indo-China and the Philippines have been <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>
                        missions. Under our reorganization, they will all become United States
                        Operations Missions, subject, of course, to the question of the future Burma
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>Likewise, in the Near East-Africa area, the missions in Greece and Turkey are
                            <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> missions, and the type of
                        coordinated economic and technical assistance program which will be carried
                        on in Iran and Egypt, for example, can best be handled by a similar type
                        mission.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the world, there is not a clear-cut division, nor can there
                        logically be one between technical assistance and economic assistance. Our
                        basic approach is that we are conducting a United States program overseas,
                        that our objectives are world-wide, that they are consistent, and that they
                        spring from the foreign policy leadership of the Secretary of State and are
                        under the direction of the President.</p>
                    <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656" facs="0682"/>
                    <p>I am entirely in agreement that either the Mission Chiefs or the Deputy
                        Mission Chiefs should also serve as the chief economic officers of the
                        Ambassadors, and we have been moving steadily in this direction, working
                        with the Assistant Secretaries concerned. Spain is currently being set up on
                        this basis.</p>
                    <p>With regard to Belgium, Denmark, The Netherlands and Portugal, we are
                        contemplating very small missions closely integrated with the Embassies. In
                        these <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, with the extensive
                        offshore procurement, counterpart, raw materials, overseas territories,
                        productivity projects, and surplus food problems, it seems quite clear to me
                        that a continuation of a small mission with the country team approach is
                        preferable to any type of special agreement for an expanded embassy financed
                        by <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> funds. We have liquidated the Mission
                        in Iceland and will further review toward the end of this current fiscal
                        year the activities and programs and the best method of administration in
                        the other countries.</p>
                    <p>I will be pleased to discuss any of these problems with you further, and in
                        the meantime my staff and its regional officers will continue to cooperate
                        closely with yours in the specific working problems.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                            target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> and the State Department, I believe that
                        the fullest possible clarification of our respective responsibilities is
                        needed to enable our staffs to carry out their assignments effectively and
                        with good teamwork.</p>
                    <p>I am concerned by the many communications from the field which have been
                        received in reply to your circular telegram of <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657"
                            facs="0683"/>August 31 (Musto 15, Tecto 41).<note n="3" xml:id="d188fn3"

                            in this and succeeding paragraphs are not printed.</note> Such replies
                        have come not only from U.S. chiefs of diplomatic missions but in a number
                        of instances from your own chief representatives abroad, either requesting
                        clarification of the role proposed for <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>
                        staffs overseas or questioning the wisdom of applying your instructions to
                            <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> staffs as they have interpreted
                        those instructions. I have in mind Ambassador Kemper’s letter to you in
                        which he states that in undertaking activities in the fields of investment
                        and trade development, your agency will be engaging in exactly the same
                        activities to which the Embassy gives a very large part of its time and
                        effort. This concern is supported by a communication from your country
                        director at Rio de Janeiro, Mr. Robert G. Groves. He fears that duplication
                        of investment and trade activities by the Embassy and <gloss
                            target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> mission might detract from good will toward
                        the technical assistance program and lessen chances of achieving U.S. policy
                        objectives. I have also in mind a series of messages from Karachi which
                        includes messages from the Ambassador and from your Mission Director, as
                        well as a joint message. All of those urged that the present organization be
                        maintained.</p>
                    <p>In other instances, while I have not seen any messages from your mission
                        directors for the same countries, the ambassadors have strongly urged
                        clarification of our intent. For example, Ambassador Donovan at Bangkok has
                        expressed grave concern over the statement contained in your message that
                        trade and investment and economic analysis functions should be performed by
                        the <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> mission, since these are Embassy
                        responsibilities and “ridiculous duplication” would result from their
                        performance by the <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> staff. Ambassador
                        Spruance at Manila has also requested instructions as to how the economic
                        functions of the Foreign Service are affected by your circular instruction.
                        He states the functions you have outlined for the <gloss target="#t_FOA1"
                            >FOA</gloss> mission “could result in wide duplication of the type which
                        Reorganization Plan 7<note n="4" xml:id="d188fn4">See the editorial note,

                        eliminate.” Ambassador Pheiffer, Dominican Republic, has sent me a copy of a
                        memorandum which he prepared at the request of Congressman Donald Jackson.
                        In this memorandum also, Ambassador Pheiffer envisages direct duplication
                        between the economic sections of the diplomatic missions and of the consular
                        offices on the one hand and your mission on the other, if all the activities
                        outlined in your circular instruction are assigned to the <gloss
                            target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> staff.</p>
                    <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0684"/>
                    <p>I believe you will agree that those reports demonstrate an undesirable lack
                        of clarity in the understanding of their respective responsibilities by our
                        overseas staffs.</p>
                    <p>You will recall that in my letter of September 28 I proposed that, in the
                        interests of greatest economy and efficiency, the <gloss target="#t_FOA1"
                            >FOA</gloss> overseas staffs should not undertake activities which the
                        Embassy economic staff is equipped to perform. In all diplomatic missions
                        the economic section is primarily organized to work on economic analysis and
                        reporting, trade and investment opportunities, and related economic matters,
                        and is charged with performing such functions for the government as a whole.
                        I fully appreciate your interest in such matters and their close
                        relationship to the activities which you are charged with administering
                        under Reorganization Plan 7. However, I do feel that the work of the
                        economic sections of the Embassies can be fully related to the efforts of
                        your field staffs if we forcefully pursue a policy of integrating our staffs
                        on economic matters under the common leadership of a single individual who
                        will serve both the Department of State and <gloss target="#t_FOA1"
                            >FOA</gloss>. This arrangement would maintain the traditional and
                        unavoidable responsibilities of the Embassy in the field of foreign economic
                        affairs and would provide you with those activities and services which are
                        essential to the successful operation of the aid programs. It will also
                        serve to clarify the confusion that has arisen in the field on the
                        respective responsibilities of the Embassy and <gloss target="#t_FOA1"
                            >FOA</gloss> field staffs on economic matters.</p>
                    <p>I am pleased to note that you agree that we should move in the direction of
                        eliminating <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> field staffs in countries
                        where aid is no longer furnished. We should keep all such cases under
                        continuous review to assure that the most efficient, economical and
                        effective arrangements are in existence.</p>
                    <p>Another factor which has increased my concern about the foregoing matters is
                        the Budget Bureau’s indication that it feels that there are possible
                        duplications between the work of the Department of State and <gloss
                            target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> overseas. I feel that we must take positive
                        steps to correct this impression before the Fiscal Year 1955 Mutual Security
                        Program is presented to the Bureau. As a means of doing so, I suggest that
                        circular telegrams to appropriate areas be prepared jointly by your
                        representatives and mine, the purpose of which would be to clarify the
                        operating relationships in the field between members of our respective
                        organizations. It is my present thought that such telegrams would prescribe
                        somewhat different patterns of cooperation, depending upon the missions to
                        which they are addressed. I have asked Mr. Nolting to be available to work
                        with whomever you may designate on this task.</p>

                    <p>In view of Mr. Dodge’s interest in those matters, I am sending him a copy of
                        this letter.<note n="5" xml:id="d188fn5">Secretary Dulles met with Stassen

                            follows: “Mr. Stassen spoke of the possibility that Congress might want
                            to send <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> back to State. I said I was
                            reluctant to see us take on these economic responsibilities, that I
                            thought things were working pretty well at present except that his
                            people in the field seem to create some jealousies vis-à-vis the regular
                            Foreign Service people. Stassen said he thought that if <gloss

                            would keep their people into alignment with ours so far as salary

                    <p>As you know, the formation of the national budget for Fiscal Year 1955 is now
                        in progress and is moving rapidly towards completion. The Mutual Security
                        part of the budget has been the subject over the past several weeks of
                        intensive hearings by the Bureau of the Budget, involving both the estimated
                        military requirements and the estimated economic requirements of our allies.
                        The total estimate of requirements for the next fiscal year is considerably
                        lower than the amount appropriated by the Congress for Fiscal Year 1954.
                        This is principally due to the fact that the Defense Department is placing
                        its financing of military end-item assistance on a more current basis than
                        heretofore—i.e., it will utilize the very large backlog of appropriated and
                        unexpended funds (approximately $10.5 billion) to reduce the amount of new
                        funds required in the coming fiscal year.</p>
                    <p>In order to enable the agencies involved to refine more precisely the Mutual
                        Security requirements for the next fiscal year, it is necessary that certain
                        basic decisions be reached. We are faced by <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660"
                            facs="0686"/>deadlines in the near future which cannot be met unless the
                        major decisions are promptly taken. These deadlines are: the requirement of
                        the Bureau of the Budget to present the total U.S. budget to the President
                        around December 15; the President’s desire to have discussions with
                        Congressional leaders on next year’s legislation during December; the
                        desirability to have draft legislation on the Mutual Security Program
                        completed and ready for introduction early in the next session. You will
                        recall that the President agreed with certain Congressional leaders at the
                        last session that the Mutual Security Program for next year would be in the
                        form of new legislation which would eliminate the “patchwork” of present
                        statutes. The drafting of new legislation has proceeded as far as possible
                        in the absence of the basic decisions referred to above, and even after such
                        decisions are reached it is expected that the completion of such legislation
                        will require a considerable amount of time.</p>

                    <p>The Bureau of the Budget has presented a list of major issues concerning the
                        Mutual Security Program with which you are familiar. The attached paper (Tab
                        A) attempts to set forth the major issues as I see them, and to make
                        recommendations on each. I hope that it may serve as a basis for meeting
                        with you early next week in order that the State Department position can be
                        firmed up on these matters.</p>

                        <p>Consideration of the following three questions will help, I think, to
                            reach conclusions on the major issues concerning the Mutual Security

                        <p>II. Concerning the military program (items 1 and 2 above), the Department
                            on the staff level has taken the position that all economic aid directly
                            related to maintaining the defense effort of our allies and to the
                            acquisition and maintenance of bases for U.S. forces should be included
                            in military aid appropriations. In Fiscal Year 1955 this would cover aid
                            to France for Indo-China, U.K., Spain, Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia.
                            Except for France and the U.K., such aid could be provided by “common
                            use” programs. The U.K. assistance could probably be met by increased
                            offshore procurement. “Budget-support” aid for France for the Indo-China
                            war will probably take the form of payments to the French Government
                            against its budget expenditures for Indo-China. This could be done by a
                            special line of credit out of Department of Defense military assistance
                            funds. A large part of the proposed economic aid for Formosa could also
                            be furnished by the Department of Defense in the form of “common use”
                            items.</p>
                        <p>On the assumption that end-item military assistance funds will be
                            appropriated to the Department of Defense, it is the staff view that
                            defense-support funds should also be appropriated to the Department of
                            Defense and administered by it. The justification for defense-support
                            assistance is primarily a military justification—viz., to enable our
                            allies to maintain in readiness, and in the case of Indo-China to
                            maintain in battle, forces which we consider necessary to our common
                            cause. To separate defense-support funds from other military assistance
                            funds would, in our judgment, weaken the case for defense-support
                            appropriations. It would also complicate the problem of administration.
                            The necessary coordination between the Department of State and
                            Department of Defense to safeguard the important foreign policy aspects
                            involved in the application of defense-support aid will be discussed
                            below.</p>
                        <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0688"/>
                        <p>With regard to the third type of assistance, economic development, the
                            major issue may be stated as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Is it desirable to shift from an economic <hi rend="italic"
                                        >grant</hi> aid policy to a <hi rend="italic">loan</hi>
                                    policy? If so, what proportion of economic aid requirements for
                                    Fiscal Year 1955 can be handled as loans, and by what U.S.
                                    agency?</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>As the idea of loans in lieu of grants has been considered in the
                            Executive Branch, a number of different views have been developed. In
                            general, those who favor the idea do so for three reasons: (a) loans
                            will enable recipient countries to do better long-range economic
                            planning, in view of the fact that a line of credit could be extended
                            over a longer period of time and provide more certainty than grant aid,
                            which can be provided only on an annual basis; (b) for the long run it
                            may be good business to hold promissory notes, even of countries whose
                            present prospects of payment are not good; (c) it will be easier to
                            obtain loan authority than grant authority from the Congress. Those who
                            do not favor the idea of loans in lieu of grants do not seem to have an
                            adequate answer to the fact that the 83rd Congress has virtually gone on
                            record in opposition to the continuation of large grants-in-aid for
                            economic assistance to foreign countries.</p>
                        <p>When it comes to the question of what particular economic assistance
                            requirements can be met by liberal loans, there is a difference of
                            opinion among the geographic bureaus of the Department. <gloss
                                target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>, for example, does not feel that the
                            requirements for the Near East and South Asia can be met entirely by
                            loans. It is my opinion that most, if not all, of the economic
                            requirements in the <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> area can and
                            should be handled on a loan rather than a grant basis, excepting, of
                            course, technical assistance; but I believe you will want to discuss
                            this question more thoroughly with Mr. Byroade.</p>
                        <p>If loans in lieu of grants are decided upon, there are several possible
                            ways of extending the loans. The first would be through the creation of
                            a new U.S. government corporation—a Development Loan Corporation—for
                            which authority and capital would have to be sought from the Congress.
                            Such a corporation should, in my opinion, be headed by a Board of
                            Directors, the majority of whom are appointed by the Secretary of State.
                            It should have a small staff in Washington, but no staff permanently
                            stationed overseas. The management of the corporation should be
                            responsive to the policy guidance of the Secretary of State. Information
                            necessary for the successful functioning of the corporation should be
                            supplied by the economic sections of the missions of the Department of
                            State overseas, both routinely and upon specific request of the
                            corporation via the Department of State. Staff members of the
                            corporation <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0689"/>would presumably
                            make field trips from time to time to make investigations of loan
                            applications. Principal reliance for effective reporting on progress of
                            projects should, however, be placed on the Embassy in the country
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>An alternative would be the Export-Import Bank. This would require
                            certain basic decisions within the Executive Branch to liberalize the
                            lending policy of that institution. Whether or not it would require new
                            legislation is presently under study. As you know, the Department of
                            State has constantly pressed for a more liberal lending policy on the
                            part of the Export-Import Bank, particularly with regard to Latin
                            America. In order for the Export-Import Bank to be an effective
                            instrument for the policy of loans in lieu of grants, it would be
                            necessary for the bank to change its orientation in order that foreign
                            policy considerations should have more weight than at present in the
                            granting of loans.</p>
                        <p>As between the two alternatives above, I am inclined to favor the former,
                            i.e., the creation of a new Development Loan Corporation, for the
                            following reasons: (a) the new corporation could function directly under
                            the policy guidance of the Secretary of State; (b) the present portfolio
                            of the Export-Import Bank would not be disturbed; (c) the new
                            corporation could make loans on more liberal terms without creating
                            pressures in the same degree for the renegotiation of existing loans
                            held by the Export-Import Bank. It has to be taken into consideration,
                            however, that the request for authorization and capitalization of a new
                            Development Loan Corporation would be more difficult to obtain from the
                            Congress than would be any necessary modification in the existing law
                            governing the Export-Import Bank.</p>
                        <p>The fourth type of assistance—Technical Assistance—has a record of
                            success and should be continued on a steady, long-range basis.
                            Adjustments in the direction of fewer projects should perhaps be made
                            after study on a country-by-country basis. On the assumption that
                            military assistance in the expanded sense will be administered by the
                            Department of Defense, and that a lending institution will administer
                            most of the economic assistance, it seems clear that the Technical
                            Assistance Program could be most efficiently and economically
                            administered by the Department of State.</p>
                        <p>Of the remaining two types of assistance, it appears that the major, if
                            not the only, case for grant economic assistance will be for
                            rehabilitation purposes in Korea. Under the concepts outlined above, the
                            Korean economic rehabilitation program might well be administered by the
                            Department of State with an overall saving of U.S. manpower and
                            administrative expense.<note n="2" xml:id="d189fn2">Secretary Dulles
                                wrote “no” at the margin of this paragraph.</note></p>
                        <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0690"/>
                        <p>Finally, funds for the multilateral programs, as previously suggested,
                            should be sought as a part of the budget of the Department of State,
                            which should administer them. This would represent no great departure
                            from the present procedure.</p>
                        <p>III. A very important question involved in the above outline is the
                            provision of the necessary coordinating machinery within the U.S.
                            Government. The principal problem of inter-agency coordination concerns
                            the military aid funds. It would not be difficult, I think, to work out
                            an effective and simple method of direct coordination between the
                            Departments of State and Defense, to provide effective guidance without
                            interference. The introduction of a third agency would only serve to
                            delay decisions and diffuse responsibility. Proper and effective
                            guidance with respect to military aid programs in order that they may
                            conform with foreign policy objectives need not place an onerous task on
                            the Department. Selective participation in the program process (planning
                            assumptions and determination of requirements, program review and
                            approval, and determination of munitions assignment priorities) would
                            provide the necessary policy guidance for the military aid program.
                            Within policy guidelines from the Department of State the responsibility
                            for the successful administration and efficient operation of the
                            military aid program should be in the Department of Defense.
                            Coordinating arrangements should be established legislatively or by
                            Executive Order to assure maximum coordination, to define clear lines of
                            responsibility, and to prescribe definite procedures for each
                            agency.</p>

                        on the manner in which they conducted their budget examination. Their
                        searching analysis and cooperative attitude has contributed greatly towards
                        the development of a sound, economical and effective Mutual Security Program
                        for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955.</p>
                    <p>In presenting the following views, the Department of State has evaluated the
                        general magnitudes of grant assistance in terms of requirements which must
                        be met for various activities and countries if we are to achieve our foreign
                        policy objectives. However, in reviewing the submissions of the operating
                        agencies we have not been in position accurately to evaluate the operational
                        feasibility to utilize effectively the funds requested for particular
                        activities. In addition, we have not taken into account at this time the
                        modalities of our assistance and their effect upon the magnitudes of aid. As
                        you are aware, the Department is studying the possible uses of <pb n="666"
                            xml:id="pg_666" facs="0692"/>surplus agricultural commodities in our
                        Mutual Security programs and the possibilities for providing assistance
                        through loans under a more liberal lending policy in lieu of grant economic
                        assistance. Final positions of the Secretary of State on the foregoing
                        questions are expected to be made within the next several weeks, and their
                        effect upon the magnitude of Mutual Security funds evaluated. These results
                        will be promptly forwarded to you.</p>

                    <p>The Department of State supports the estimate of $2.4 billion for military
                        assistance—i.e., for <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss>, including
                        offshore procurement. I should like to stress, however, that it continues to
                        be the position of the Department of State that “defense-support”
                        requirements should be sought in the category of “military assistance”, and
                        such requirements would thus be additive to the $2.4 billion figure. The
                        Department supports the $2.4 billion estimate of requirements by the
                        Department of Defense on grounds that it will be a step toward placing the
                        financing of the <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> program on a more
                        current basis, and that the large undelivered parts of the program taken in
                        combination with the plan to finance lead time with Department of Defense
                        funds does not justify additional financing in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 55 beyond that recommended by the Department of Defense.</p>
                    <p>The Department of State considers that the $2.4 billion figure is a minimal
                        figure for the following reasons: <list>

                            <item>There should, in the opinion of this Department, be a provision
                                similar to Section 5136 of the present Mutual Security Act giving
                                discretionary authority to the President to transfer funds from
                                military assistance appropriations for unforeseen emergencies; the
                                reduction of the $2,4 billion figure, as we see it, would leave
                                little possibility of effecting such transfers without seriously
                                delaying the accomplishment of military objectives.</item>

                            <item>The Department believes that a program of the magnitude of $2.4
                                billion, which represents a substantial reduction below <gloss

                                for commitments in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and other
                                security arrangements, and that this can be adequately explained to
                                our allies without adverse political effects. A further reduction of
                                the figure, however, might well result in the elimination of any
                                further contribution to the war reserve equipment for <gloss

                                which might be interpreted as a change of our policy in Western

                                appears almost certain, however, that a fairly large number of

                                would increase the difficulties of reprogramming to meet the higher
                                priority requirements of such units as are not now covered in the

                                force goals.</item>

                            <item>While the program presented by the Department of Defense does not
                                make special provision for certain contingent requirements for
                                military assistance in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955, the
                                Department of State believes it may be necessary to reprogram, as a
                                matter of priority, some part of the $2.4 billion for such
                                requirements. Among the countries where we believe this may be the
                                case is Germany, Japan, Iran, and Pakistan and possibly several
                                other nations in the Middle East and the American Republics.
                                Reduction below the $2.4 billion submission would impair the
                                possibility of reprogramming without serious prejudice to the
                                accomplishment of other objectives of this program.</item>

                            <item>It should also be pointed out that the Executive Branch is
                                actively considering a decision to provide non-nuclear new weapons
                                for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces. If this decision
                                is made there is doubt that the figure of $2.4 billion will be
                                sufficient to implement this plan.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>An assumption which should be stressed in connection with the Department of
                        State’s support of the $2.4 billion figure is that we will succeed in making
                        substantial deliveries of equipment to our allies. The contemplated sharp
                        reduction in new obligational authority in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1955, particularly in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area,
                        coupled with a failure to deliver past programs, would undoubtedly lead our
                        allies to believe that we were reversing our policies towards Western
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>A major objective of the mutual security program is to support the continued
                        development in Europe and the Far East of an adequate military production
                        base. The offshore procurement portion of the Mutual Defense Assistance
                        program has been and will continue to be a key element in achieving this
                        objective. The assumption that a substantial volume of offshore procurement
                        could and would be continued under the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1955 <gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss> program is a major factor in the
                        Department’s support of the reduction in “defense support” programs for that
                        year.</p>

                    <p>The Department strongly supports the estimate of $800 million for support of
                        the military operation in Indochina to be included as <pb n="668"

                        accordance with our discussion with Mr. Macy of your staff, a costing
                        exercise for this program for calendar year 1954 is being undertaken and
                        will be completed before the time for submission of legislation to Congress.
                        Out of this costing study should come the basis for projecting 1955 costs
                        and a firmer estimate of the amount of this important requirement.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Berlin</hi></p>
                    <p>For West Berlin, the Department believes that an estimate of $30 million for
                        grant assistance would be adequate to achieve our foreign policy objectives.
                        The Department considers the attainment of our objectives in Berlin to be of
                        a high priority. To this end we believe it essential to attain the goal of a
                        further reduction of unemployment in Berlin by another 50,000 for the coming
                        year. While it is our expectation that we will be successful in our
                        negotiations to have the Federal Republic further increase its support to
                        Berlin in 1956, we believe that U.S. aid of about the same level furnished
                        in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 ($30 million) will be required. On
                        the assumption of a greater share of the support of Berlin by the Federal
                        Republic, we have in our estimate substantially reduced the pipeline beyond

                        desired in Turkey may not be possible on the basis of the amount of aid now
                        programmed in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954, or the $40 million

                        required to enable the U.S. to fulfill its commitment should be included in
                        the “one line item” until there is a U.S. position on financing Plan K for
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 and <gloss target="#t_FY1"

                        hope that a satisfactory U.K. effort in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1955 could be attained without requiring the full U.S. contribution to the
                        cost of Plan K and the additional special $75 million program. In this case,
                        the estimate to be justified before Congress should reflect any reduction
                        under this amount that can be achieved.</p>

                    <p>This Department recommends $40 million for technical assistance for the Arab
                        States, Iran, and Israel, and the independent states and D.O.T.’s in Africa.
                        This amount would provide for continuation of going programs at present
                        levels in most of the States, for an increase in the Egyptian program, and
                        about $4 million for the D.O.T.’s.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Special Economic Assistance</hi></p>
                    <p>The Department believes that in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 a
                        program of $140 million, in addition to any <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1954 unexpended balances, will effectively support our
                        policies in the Near Eastern area. This estimate would provide $50 million
                        for the Arab States, $40 million for Israel . . . .</p>
                    <p>The Department is of the opinion that in the case of Libya and the D.O.T.’s
                        no special economic aid programs should be provided for those areas. Funds
                        for Libya are directly related to our bases in that country and should be
                        furnished from Department of Defense <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0696"
                        />funds. In the D.O.T.’s, the requirements are for investment funds which
                        should be provided by the metropoles or by private and public lending
                        institutions.</p>

                        components, and considers the ratio a major factor in dividing U.S. aid

                    <p>The Department supports the estimate for aid to Korea ($200 million),
                        Thailand ($5 million), and Indonesia ($5 million), and recommends a program
                        of $65 million for Formosa.</p>
                    <p>With respect to Indochina and the Philippines, the Department supports the

                        in those countries.</p>
                    <p>The Department does not support the supplemental request of $15 million for
                        Indochina for an additional program of relief-rehabilitation. An initial
                        start on this program is anticipated in the $30 million estimate and it is
                        anticipated that legislative authority will be sought to permit using
                        military funds for rehabilitation activities in the event hostilities are

                        the Department recommends that $5 million be provided at this time. In the

                        essential that we be prepared to do all we can to assist the newly-elected

                            two amendments to this letter. They were as follows: “The amount which
                            this Department supports for contribution to <gloss target="#t_ICEM1"
                                >ICEM</gloss> is $11,737,000, rather than the $11,400,000 mentioned

                            the Legislative Leadership Meeting(s) of Dec. 17 and 18, 1953. Mutual
                            Security was discussed on Dec. 17 and more briefly on Dec. 18.</note> On
                        the first day, I understand that there will be an overall discussion of the
                        federal budget, of which the Mutual Security Program is a part, but that no
                        detailed consideration of the Mutual Security Program is expected until the

                        some general statements in connection with the need to continue the Mutual
                        Security Program during Fiscal Year 1955, in order to carry forward our
                        foreign policy objectives. At Friday’s meeting, it will be necessary to go
                        into the program in more detail and, if possible, to outline the Executive
                        Branch’s thinking with regard to (1) amounts of aid required, (2) method of
                        financing, (3) the possible use of agricultural surpluses, (4) the possible

                        disagreement within the Executive Branch. Those reasons are, in brief: (a)
                        that the military strength of the coalition of free nations has not yet
                        reached the point at which the United States can, in its own self-interest,
                        cease to contribute toward strengthening the defensive capabilities of our
                        essential allies; and further, that we have committed ourselves to do so by
                        our acceptance of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> force goals in
                        the 1953 Annual Review; (b) that there are certain areas of the world (for
                        example, the Near East, Latin America, and South Asia) in which the United
                        States, again in its own self-interest, should continue to help achieve
                        political stability and a decent standard of living without which military
                        strength and the capacity for local resistance against Communism are
                        impossible; and (c) that this Administration has made the most exhaustive
                        and searching analysis of the Mutual Security Program in all of its aspects
                        in order to screen out and to reduce requirements to the minimum consistent
                        with our vital interests, and through such analysis has managed to make
                        substantial reductions in the amount of assistance which it considers
                        necessary. This amount could have been further reduced had it not been for
                        the urgent requirement to assist the French and the Associated States of
                        Indo-China to mount and to continue the effort to win the war in
                        Indo-China.</p>
                    <p>At the meeting on Friday, we expect the Mutual Security Program to be taken
                        up in greater detail. As you are aware, there are certain problems and
                        issues presently unresolved among the various interested agencies of the
                        Government. While there is general agreement that the Mutual Security
                        Program must be continued, the focus of disagreement is principally on the
                        method of financing the programs and to a lesser extent on the level of
                        certain programs. These differences should be considered under two
                        categories—the military programs and the economic programs (including the
                        technical assistance programs). The major issue involves the military
                        programs.</p>
                    <p>In general, the Department of Defense, <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>,
                        and the Department of State, with minor differences of view, agree both as
                        to the level of worldwide requirements for next year and as to the method of
                        financing such requirements. The Bureau of the Budget, on the other hand,
                        while accepting in general the estimates of requirements submitted by the
                        three agencies, take the position that (a) the level of expenditures
                        projected by the operating agencies for Fiscal Year 1955 are higher than
                        past experience justifies, and (b) the over-financing of the military
                        programs in past years justifies a further sharp reduction in the amount
                        which should be requested of the Congress for Fiscal Year 1955, over and
                        above the substantial cutback already proposed by the Department of Defense.
                        There <pb n="674" xml:id="pg_674" facs="0700"/>is no question that there has
                        been very considerable over-financing of the military assistance programs in
                        the past—that is to say, that unexpended funds from previous appropriations
                        are sufficient to continue the flow of military end-item assistance to our
                        allies for the next two to three years at least. However, it must be
                        emphasized that we are greatly in arrears on deliveries, and that the arms
                        which will be paid for from the unexpended balances are already destined to
                        fill past commitments, thus leaving present and future requirements to be
                        filled from funds not yet appropriated. The Budget Bureau has reviewed the
                        Fiscal Year 1955 programs and has prepared its recommendations for the
                        President. A comparison of these recommendations with the agency requests is
                        set forth in the attached tables.</p>
                    <p>The Budget Bureau’s recommendations raise the following issues with respect
                        to obligational authority and levels of expenditures:</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Military Aid</hi></p>
                    <p>The Bureau generally accepts the figure of $2.1 billion as a reasonable
                        statement of worldwide military requirements which should be programmed in
                        Fiscal Year 1955 to meet our undertakings in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> and other security arrangements, against which deliveries
                        will be made over a period of several years. However, the Bureau has taken
                        the position that the military end-item program needs new funds in the
                        amount of only $1 billion in Fiscal Year 1955 for carrying out the program
                        and that the remainder of the requirements should be initially financed by
                        Department of Defense funds which would be reimbursed from subsequent
                        military aid appropriations upon delivery of the materiel. This position
                        obviously creates a domestic political hazard—the probable unwillingness of
                        future Congresses to appropriate funds in greater amount than the request in
                        Fiscal Year 1955—and a foreign policy hazard—namely, to convince our allies
                        that we will in fact be able to honor present commitments by means of <hi
                            rend="italic">future</hi> requests for funds. Another point which is of
                        particular significance foreign-policywise is that the Bureau, in its
                        recommendation, allowed for an off-shore procurement program of only about
                        $160 million compared to $600 to $700 million in the $2.1 billion program
                        submitted by <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>. This proposed cutback in
                        off-shore procurement will have severe repercussions in Europe, both in
                        terms of the dollar positions of producing countries and their employment
                        problems, and in terms of the maintenance of a war production base in
                        Europe. It will also have an adverse effect in Japan in terms of the
                        Japanese desire to earn dollars if they are to go into a rearmament
                        program.</p>
                    <p>In general, State, Defense, and <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> do not
                        quarrel with the objective of placing the Mutual Security Program on a more
                        current <pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0701"/>financial basis. However,
                        we feel that the Budget Bureau’s recommendation is too severe. It creates
                        grave political hazards not only in regard to the matters mentioned above,
                        but also in terms of the general political impact upon our allies of so
                        severe a cutback in requested new funds. In our opinion, the placing of the
                        military part of the Mutual Security Program upon a “<gloss target="#t_COD1"
                            >COD</gloss> basis” should be done gradually, not abruptly. Under the
                        estimate of $2.1 billion, a long step would be taken in placing the program
                        on a current basis. We have taken the position that this is manageable from
                        a foreign policy point of view <hi rend="italic">provided</hi> deliveries of
                        equipment are accelerated. It is here that the Budget Bureau’s contemplated
                        limitation on expenditures has its effect. If we are successful, by
                        Presidential order or through some other means, of catching up on our
                        deliveries of equipment (approximately $5 billion of items delivered in
                        Fiscal Year 1955 is a reasonable target), this will automatically raise the
                        Mutual Security Program expenditure figure above that contemplated by the
                        Bureau of the Budget. Any attempt, therefore, to freeze on a limit of
                        expenditures under the Mutual Security Program for Fiscal Year 1955 below
                        the expenditure estimate contained in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>

                            Assistance)</hi></p>
                    <p>With some relatively minor differences, <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>
                        and State are in agreement on estimates of economic assistance worldwide.
                        The Bureau of the Budget has reduced this estimate by approximately 25
                        percent. We have gone back at them with additional material and explanations
                        and I understand that the Budget Bureau staff has revised upward some of its
                        estimates, notably Indo-China and Turkey. A part of the difference results
                        from different projections of funds which can be expended and from a
                        difference in estimated carryovers. On the whole, I believe that we can
                        successfully negotiate with the Bureau of the Budget on the economic aid
                        requirements on an item-by-item basis and can probably accept the result
                        without undue worry.</p>
                    <p>Two major factors affecting economic aid, however, have not yet been fully
                        worked out or agreed in the Executive Branch. These are the possible use of
                        surplus agricultural commodities in substitution for other forms of economic
                        assistance and the possible use of loans in lieu of grants.</p>
                    <p>On the use of surplus agricultural commodities, there is unanimity of view
                        among the interested agencies on the objective to be achieved, but as yet no
                        firm basis for decision on the extent to <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676"
                            facs="0702"/>which such surplus commodities can be used in substitution
                        for economic assistance. The present thinking of the agencies concerned has
                        produced a target figure of $1 billion in surplus commodities to be exported
                        to friendly nations over a period of three years. This seems a feasible
                        target and if achievable makes a considerable dent in the surplus
                        agricultural commodities problem. However, the assumption that the sale of
                        this amount of surplus commodities (approximately $300 million per year) for
                        local currency, or alternatively the grant of such commodities, will reduce
                        the need by equal amount of economic assistance is open to some doubt. No
                        negotiations have been entered into with possible recipient countries to
                        determine the kinds and amounts of surplus commodities which they in fact
                        can absorb. Since the problem is largely one of the ability of recipient
                        countries to sell the products on their local markets, negotiations of
                        rather far-reaching character have to be undertaken before these estimates
                        can become firm.</p>
                    <p>The question of the extent to which loans can be substituted for grant
                        economic assistance is another point on which no firm conclusions have been
                        reached. I believe some headway has been made in bringing about serious
                        consideration of the proposal that a more liberal lending policy ought to be
                        adopted by the U.S., probably through the Export-Import Bank. In the absence
                        of any high level decision on this point, however, it is not possible at
                        this stage to estimate the amount of grant assistance which could be taken
                        up by loans.</p>
                    <p>On the question of organization within the U.S. Government to carry on a
                        Mutual Security Program next year, the following outlines have emerged: (1)
                        military assistance should include defense-support items such as Indo-China
                        and other programs closely related to the maintenance of agreed force
                        levels; (2) military funds should be appropriated to the Department of
                        Defense; (3) in authorizing legislation or perhaps by Executive Order, the
                        Department of State should have a strong voice in the programming of such
                        funds and in the allocation of matériel; (4) beyond this, there is no
                        unanimity of view with respect to organizational questions.</p>

                    <p>In the meantime, staff of the Budget Bureau are currently discussing with

                    <p>At the outset, I want to assure you that we agree on the need to proceed as
                        rapidly as possible in the formulation of both the legislation and the
                        necessary illustrative programs for presentation to the Congress at as early
                        a date as possible. I understand that the drafting of the legislation and
                        the preparation of programs and a presentation book are proceeding as a
                        joint effort between members of your staff, Defense Department and State
                        Department officers. I realize, however, that a failure to agree upon an
                        Executive Branch position with respect to certain of the issues raised in
                        your memorandum would, at some point, impede the work now going on. I am
                        therefore anxious to give you a complete statement of the views of this
                        Department on these issues so that we may proceed as <pb n="682"
                            xml:id="pg_682" facs="0708"/>rapidly as possible to the formulation of a
                        program for presentation to the Congress.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the name of the program, it is my view that the present
                        name—The Mutual Security Program—is an adequate and acceptable descriptive
                        title. I think that a change to the title, “Freedom Fund”, would be
                        confusing and possibly misleading. Since the program represents by and large
                        a continuation of many of the activities carried on in the past—although
                        some activities have been eliminated and others sharply curtailed—I do not
                        believe that a change in the title would be helpful in gaining for the

                    <p>I have three comments with regard to your paragraph II 2. I had understood
                        that it was agreed between the agencies involved that funds for carrying on
                        the Mutual Military Program would be sought as a direct appropriation to the
                        Secretary of Defense, rather than to the President as you suggest. This
                        question is not a matter of direct concern to this Department, but it has
                        been my understanding that the matter had been agreed, based on the
                        consideration that the Mutual Military Program should be clearly identified
                        as a part of our national defense effort. What is of direct concern to this
                        Department, however, is the absolute necessity, from the foreign policy
                        point of view, that there be provided either by legislation or by Executive
                        Order the means for assuring adequate guidance and direction in the
                        programming of the funds in order that the Mutual Military Program will
                        fulfill its important foreign policy purposes.<note n="4" xml:id="d195fn4"

                            when activated to Defense. Leg [?] automatically assures this.” The
                            reference to Meyer is presumably to Clarence E. Meyer, Director of U.S.
                            Operations Mission at Vienna.</note></p>
                    <p>My second point with regard to this section of your memorandum concerns the
                        surplus agricultural disposal bill. I believe that the proposed legislation
                        for the disposal overseas of $1 billion of surplus agricultural commodities
                        over a three-year period, presently being developed on an interdepartmental
                        basis, should be put forward as separate legislation, rather than being
                        incorporated in the Mutual Security bill. As a separate piece of
                        legislation, the funds would be requested separately from those for the
                        Mutual Security Program. My reason is twofold: the first is that I think it
                        would be politically helpful and wise to move ahead as rapidly as possible
                        in an effort to assist in solving the problem of surplus agricultural
                        commodities and that separate legislation for this purpose could and should
                        be passed prior to the passage of the Mutual Security <pb n="683"
                            xml:id="pg_683" facs="0709"/>bill; and second, I think that from the
                        foreign policy point of view it is preferable not to have the Surplus Food
                        Disposal legislation confused with the Mutual Security Program. In this
                        general connection, it is important to note the decision that was reached at
                        Governor Adams’ office on February 5 that an Administrative Assistant to the
                        President should be appointed, whose responsibility would be to see that the
                        views of the Executive Branch are coordinated on the whole range of surplus
                        agricultural issues, including the question of administration of the
                        resulting policies and programs.<note n="5" xml:id="d195fn5">In the margin
                            next to this paragraph appears the following notation: “Even though

                            Europe for Foreign Operations.</note></p>
                    <p>My third comment concerns the multilateral programs. It is my understanding
                        that the original decision to include the requests for contributions to
                        multilateral organizations in the appropriation to the Department of State
                        was based on the expressed desire of the Appropriations Committees. However,
                        after discussions with members of your staff, we agree that it is preferable
                        to request these funds as an appropriation to the President, provided
                        consultations with appropriate committee chairmen indicate that they are
                        willing to go along with this procedure. In any event, we should not fail to
                        coordinate the activities of the multilateral programs with similar
                        activities carried on bilaterally between the United States and other
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>I agree with the recommendations in your paragraphs II 3 and II 4, except as
                        modified by the above comments.</p>
                    <p>With respect to paragraph II 5, this Department has no comment on the
                        question of merging of funds, provided we can be furnished adequate reports
                        on the status and progress of the military programs.<note n="6"

                            following notation: “Now agreed with Kyes.”</note></p>
                    <p>Regarding paragraph II 6, I agree that preparations for presentation to the
                        Congress should be made on the basis that the Foreign Operations
                        Administration should coordinate the programs as at present. I also agree
                        with your view that the question of organization and coordination should not
                        be made an Executive Branch issue with the Congress and that the main
                        concentration should be upon the substance of the program.</p>
                    <p>In paragraph III you list as broad objectives of the program what appear to
                        me as objectives of the entire United States Government’s efforts in the
                        field of foreign policy. While, of course, the <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684"
                            facs="0710"/>Mutual Security Program contributes to our attainment of
                        these objectives, I should think our presentation to the Congress should be
                        in terms of the specific support this program provides to our effort to
                        obtain these objectives, principally in the fields of military and economic
                        assistance and technical cooperation. I think it would be a mistake to
                        convey the impression that these principles are peculiar to the Mutual
                        Security Program and I would not favor so broad a statement of the
                        objectives of that program either in the draft legislative bill or in the
                        presentation to the Congress. This comment applies particularly to
                        objectives No. 2 and No. 3, in the promotion of which several governmental
                        agencies and departments participate. So far as the administration of the
                        program is concerned, I feel that all agencies of the U.S. Government
                        involved in this program should work together to promote these objectives,
                        but that the division of responsibility between them should continue as at
                        present.</p>
                    <p>In order that these matters may finally be worked out among the interested
                        agencies of the Government, I believe that a meeting of the principal
                        officers concerned should take place at an early date in order that the
                        preparation of this program for presentation to the Congress can move
                        forward rapidly.<note n="7" xml:id="d195fn7">At the bottom of the source

                    <p>The six months ending December 31, 1953 witnessed marked but spotty progress
                        toward the major objectives of the Mutual Security Program: building
                        military strength of the free world, maintaining economic stability,
                        promoting economic development, and, on occasion, mitigating financial
                        crises. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ground forces and Navies met
                        goals, but still were below desired standards. Air Forces lagged behind
                        schedule. The <hi rend="italic">European</hi> economic picture was
                        considerably improved in comparison with 1952, although the rate of economic
                        growth is still inadequate to meet long-range civilian and military needs.

                        on the Palestine refugee problem. The war in <hi rend="italic"
                            >Indochina</hi> continued to dominate Far Eastern developments. On the

                        bombing, to deter the Soviet from going to war; and secondly, in the event

                        shortfalls, mainly in France, the U.K. and Italy. Despite generally adequate
                        defense budgets, isolated shortfalls were attributable to lagging
                        expenditures or inadequate budgetary provisions, e.g. to some extent in the

                        to the Italian air force were so serious as to compel the U.S. Defense
                        Annual Review Team to recommend shifting funds from other services if the
                        necessary addition to total defense expenditures could not be achieved.</p>

                        has not been met, substantial slippage in activation and training of German
                        units, as projected in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> study, must
                        be anticipated. Force planning is based on the ultimate need for 12 army
                        groupements, 1,326 front-line aircraft, 140 naval vessels, and proper
                        support forces. The buildup is planned as essentially a two-year buildup,
                        with some exceptions. Meanwhile, there have been formulated the following
                        tentative December 1954 German force goals, having status only as <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> approved planning goals for development of

                    <p>Preliminary cost estimates for the Germany buildup were included in the
                        Financial Appendix to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 160/1. These took
                        account of direct military costs, U.S. and U.K. support costs, costs of
                        other troop support, infrastructure, <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss>,
                        commissariat expenses, Berlin contribution and other national costs. The
                        Appendix estimated that Germany might reasonably be expected to make a
                        defense contribution of about five-sixths of the total cost of over $14
                        billion (which includes $1.6 billion already programmed as U.S. military
                        assistance).</p>
                    <p>However, the Germans have now submitted to the Ad Hoc Committee of the <gloss
                            target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> a financial and utilization plan which
                        estimates buildup costs far in excess of those shown in the Financial
                        Appendix. These estimates, which total about $15.4 billion for a group of
                        expenditures computed in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper as
                        costing $7.2 billion, are currently being studied by the Ad Hoc Committee.
                        U.S. authorities in Bonn feel that the estimates in the Financial Appendix
                        were extremely conservative, and that actual costs will be somewhere between
                        these estimates and the estimates the Germans themselves are putting

                    <p>In dollar value terms, approximately 44% of the funded programs have resulted
                        in shipments of matériel to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
                        Germany, i.e. $13.5 billion programmed and $6.0 billion shipped. This
                        included shipments to the German stockpile which totalled $.4 billion. In
                        the last six months of calendar 1953, shipments amounted to $1.1 billion,
                        almost 20% of total shipments to date. In terms of major items of equipment,
                        the Army has delivered almost 9,000 tanks, 17,000 combat vehicles and 1.3
                        million small arms and machine guns out of programmed totals of 10,000,
                        20,500 and 1.7 million respectively. The Navy, due to the long lead time
                        involved in production of vessels, had still to deliver over 50% of its
                        program, principally in the mine-vessel category. The Air Force similarly
                        had about 50% of its program to deliver.</p>
                    <p>Recent cables from <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss> point out that the
                        rate of deliveries of <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> end-items is
                        lagging below the $350 million monthly level which the U.S. Government had
                        estimated in connection with the 1953 Annual Review. The cables “strongly
                        urge immediate high level consideration of deliveries situation”, because of
                        the possibility that current delivery rates might “cast serious doubt on
                        reliability of U.S. forecasts and . . . . .<note n="5" xml:id="d196fn5"

                        policy.” However, since the U.S. delivery estimate was based upon European
                        capacity to effectively absorb the equipment, the U.S. is currently
                        conducting studies to determine if in fact additional capacity exists
                        warranting an increase in delivery levels.</p>

                    <p>The main uncertainty posed by this prospect is the problem of the <hi

                        consideration and analysis in the Annual Review process. The 1953 analysis
                        of this problem is not yet available; but a rough estimate of the recurring

                        about $10 billion. In addition, appreciable expenditures will be required
                        over the next few years for “completion of the buildup as now planned”, and
                        for qualitative improvements in existing forces. Finally, the factor of
                        obsolescence cannot be ignored and, if the cost of the initial buildup is
                        any criterion, will run to very substantial figures even if spread over a

                        the force levels at the accepted force goals.</p>

                        <p>Expansion of the European defense production base has been rapid during
                            the past three years, though it is not possible to measure this
                            expansion with any precision. Improvement has been both quantitative and
                            qualitative. New plants have been built, and old plants have been
                            re-equipped to produce modern weapons efficiently. European deliveries
                            for defense hard goods financed with <hi rend="italic">indigenous
                                funds</hi> (i.e. exclusive of <gloss target="#t_OSP1">OSP</gloss>)
                            increased from $1.1 billion in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1951 to
                            a current annual rate of almost $3 billion in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1953 and 1954. With few exceptions, such as ammunition
                            facilities, where expansion of capacity to meet wartime needs has been
                            undertaken, more European production capacity exists than can be
                            utilized with the limited funds available. Activation of any significant
                            additional part of this unused capacity is to a large extent dependent
                            on German defense expenditures. The Financial Appendix to <gloss

                            Correlated Production Programs (CPP) which thus far have been developed
                            for selected types of army ammunition, aircraft, artillery, vehicles,
                            electronics equipment, and ships. With few exceptions, notably aircraft,
                            these programs have not yet brought about any significant degree of

                            and have been primarily an exercise in the tabling of individual country

                            production efforts will result in the future. Excellent individual

                            process of correlating and integrating certain of their spare parts
                            programs. Efforts to <hi rend="italic">standardize <gloss

                            standard.</p>
                        <p>The United States has given varying degrees of support to these programs
                            through offshore procurement, considering each item in the program on
                            its own merits. To date, CPP includes a $560 million joint aircraft
                            program (1675 aircraft), with the U.S. covering about half the cost with
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 <gloss target="#t_MDAP1"
                                >MDAP</gloss> funds. The recommended <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1954 CPP includes $620 million for 24 selected items of
                            army equipment, and $840 million for 17 ammunition items. U.S. support
                            of about $612 million was recommended; and current U.S. plans earmark
                            $438 million, mostly for ammunition.</p>

                        <p>The vast and growing economic potential of the Federal Republic thus far
                            supplies only the relatively minor defense contribution represented by

                            Appendix estimates potential German matériel production at $2 billion,

                            production—Allied control measures restricting German output have been
                            modified to clear the way for placing about $50 million of <gloss

                            has been made in the direction of substantive planning for the eventual
                            German contribution to Western defense production. Complicating factors
                            include not only Allied restrictions and French fears but the question
                            of timing—i.e. the choice between a <hi rend="italic">rapid</hi> force
                            buildup, requiring immediate provision of equipment once <gloss

                            which German defense production could play a greater part.</p>
                        <p>The eventual pattern of military production in Western Germany will
                            depend in some measure on the strategic and security concerns reflected
                            in the <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> treaty. By agreement, there
                            will be no manufacture of atomic, chemical, and biological weapons in
                            Germany; while production of certain naval vessels, mines, propellants,
                            guided missiles, and military aircraft can only be undertaken after
                            unanimous agreement of the <gloss target="#t_EDC1">EDC</gloss> council.
                            No production of aircraft is planned, though a large capacity exists for
                            the manufacture of aircraft spare parts and ground supporting equipment.
                            Production of finished combat vehicles is limited by the two or
                            three-year lead time required. However, German industry can produce
                            transport vehicles, telecommunications equipment, and radio receivers
                            and transmitters in large volume. Ammunition output could get underway
                            rapidly. Production of smaller type naval craft is underway.</p>

                    <p>The U.S. military objective in Yugoslavia is to assist in the equipping and
                        training of military forces which are essential to resist external
                        aggression, and are of direct assistance in defense of the <gloss

                        in Europe this side of the Iron Curtain, comprising as it does 28 divisions.
                        A military effort of the size which the U.S. desires, cannot be maintained
                        through Yugoslav effort alone.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. objective for <hi rend="italic">Spain</hi> is the development of the
                        military potential of Spain’s strategic position for the common defense of
                        the <gloss target="#t_NAT1">NAT</gloss> area. Militarily, this objective is
                        to be achieved by two courses of action: (1) development and use of Spanish
                        air and naval bases by the U.S., and (2) strengthening Spanish armed forces
                        through provision of <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> assistance. Three
                        related agreements to effect these courses of action were signed by Spain
                        and the U.S. in September 1953. Included in the base program, of which only
                        the local currency portion is financed by <gloss target="#t_MSP1"
                            >MSP</gloss> appropriations, are 7 air bases and 4 naval bases. The

                        partially to offset the inflationary impact of base construction activities.
                        While preliminary negotiations had been undertaken and contracts let, no
                        actual construction had been undertaken as of the date of this report. The

                        condition “if coupled with appropriate U.S. economic and trade policies”.
                        These policies should include (among others) lower tariffs, incentives to
                        increase the flow of private investment abroad, revision of U.S. merchant

                        direct economic aid marks the shifting of initiative and responsibility to
                        the individual countries themselves for the further efforts toward increased

                    <p>The continuing pipeline of extraordinary dollar expenditures provides a

                        annual rate of over 6% from 1949 to 1951. Industrial production increased an
                        estimated 5% and agricultural production an estimated 5%. The main rise in
                        production occurred in the last three-quarters of 1953. The striking feature
                        of the past six months was an accelerated rise in output by most of the
                        Western European countries, in contrast to 1952, when Germany alone among
                        the larger countries expanded substantially. Unemployment fell slightly in
                        Western Europe as a whole during 1953, chiefly as the result of reductions
                        in the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands. However, unemployment
                        increased in France, Italy (the particular countries which are specific
                        sources of weakness in the coalition) and in some of the smaller

                    <p>The improvement in the external balance is attributable to several factors:
                        U.S. military expenditures in Western Europe (including <gloss

                        continued to move in Europe’s favor, although at a much slower rate in the
                        second half of the year; Europe’s imports of primary products—particularly
                        from the U.S.—fell, while its exports to the U.S. increased, stimulated by
                        high levels of U.S. activity; and the increase in agricultural output during
                        1952–53, especially a bumper grain crop, permitted some import saving,
                        particularly dollar saving.</p>

                    <p>Intra-European trade had by the second quarter of 1953 increased upwards of
                        25% by volume and 46% by value over the first half of 1950. In this, the
                        trade-liberalization drive of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>, and
                        the payments facilities provided under the European Payments Union have
                        played an important part. As of January 1, 1954, the <gloss

                    <p>This achievement is due in no small measure to persistent U.S. persuasion and

                        (1) that the achievement of the 75% quota liberalization as of January <pb

                        in certain countries to deter open aggression and violent revolution, and
                        (2) accelerated improvements in living conditions through economic
                        development. Accomplishments to December 31, 1953, include some dramatic
                        successes, like the rescue of Iran from certain bankruptcy and probable
                        revolution and averting widespread famine in Pakistan, and a number of minor
                        successes which can be evaluated only in the perspective of the
                        slowly-developing cumulative impact of economic development programs. In
                        some areas—the Arab refugee problem, Israel economic difficulties—there is
                        no real progress to report.</p>
                    <p>The military program includes continuing end-item aid and defense support to
                        Greece and Turkey, but the demands of their economic development programs
                        have threatened budget support for present forces, which have not yet

                        can be expected to provide little more than the maintenance of internal
                        security. Pakistan has requested military aid and indicated interest in a
                        defense pact with Turkey. It appears probable that such a pact will be
                        concluded. Iraq, also, has shown interest in United States military

                    <p>Since the formal recognition by Secretary Dulles last spring that the time
                        and events were not propitious for the achievement of a Middle East Defense
                        Organization, it has become United States policy to develop bilateral
                        defense arrangements with selected countries of the area. The policy
                        conclusions of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 162/2 are that, to assure
                        access to oil and to strategic positions in the area, the U.S. should build
                        on the military strength of Turkey, Pakistan, and—to the extent possible—of
                        Iran and Iraq; at the same time assisting in achieving stability in the
                        region by political actions and by limited military, economic, and technical
                        assistance to other countries. The purpose of bilateral military assistance
                        arrangements is, accordingly, to increase the military strength of the
                        region and to provide a nucleus of military power which may be expanded
                        later into a regional defense arrangement whose strongest members would be
                        Turkey and Pakistan. This concept is the basis of the program which is just
                        now being launched.</p>

                        concerning that country’s request for military assistance. This has
                        brightened the prospect of achieving a regional defense arrangement
                        eventually to include Pakistan, Turkey, Iran and Iraq. <gloss

                    <p>The stimulus for an Ethiopian military assistance program arose from a U.S.
                        desire to obtain a long term commitment for the use of Asmara airbase in
                        Eritrea. In exchange for such a commitment the U.S. and Ethiopia signed
                        agreements covering both a base program and a military assistance program in
                        May of 1953.</p>
                    <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Objectives</hi></p>
                    <p>U.S. military objectives vis-à-vis Ethiopia are to strengthen the armed
                        forces of that country in order to contribute to the (1) security of
                        American military installations in that country and (2) ability of that

                        the following JSC force basis has been developed: 1 training center and 1

                    <p>In view of Egypt’s strategic location, the U.S. Government, contingent on
                        settlement of the Suez impasse, decided to provide military assistance to
                        Egypt. By letter of July 15, 1953, the President indicated to Prime Minister
                        Naguib that the U.S. would provide military and economic assistance.<note

                    <p>No action has been taken to implement this program in light of the continuing

                        U.S. forces of the Dharan Air field. The U.S.-proposed agreement to cover a

                    <p>The most striking features of the diverse economies of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> area are (1) the abject poverty of the
                        great mass of the population, and (2) the dangerously slow rate of
                        improvement. The average per capita income in the area is well below $100
                        annually.</p>
                    <p>Best estimates show a rise of only 1.6% in aggregate <gloss target="#t_GNP1"
                            >GNP</gloss> of the <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> area during
                        1953. Movements in individual countries generally ranged from fair
                        improvement in petroleum-producing areas to stagnation or actual losses in
                        countries dependent on exports of agricultural or mineral products.</p>
                    <p>The food situation is generally better than it was a year ago, although
                        chronic population pressure persists in several areas, e.g. India-Pakistan,
                        Egypt. A relatively good crop in India permitted a reduction of foodgrain
                        imports from 3.9 million tons in 1952 to less than 2.0 million tons in 1953.
                        In Pakistan a critical food shortage was relieved by the special U.S. wheat
                        program. Prices have declined and hoarded grain has come out of storage. The
                        outlook for the coming harvest is favorable in both India and Pakistan.
                        During 1953 U.S. wheat aid also helped to relieve shortages in Jordan and
                        Libya. A request by Afghanistan for wheat aid is under review.</p>
                    <p>The void created by Iran’s petroleum shutdown was more than filled by other
                        countries in the area during 1952 and further substantial expansion was
                        achieved in 1953, especially by Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Total crude
                        oil production in the <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> area rose 4% in
                        1952 and 19% during 1953.</p>
                    <p>Development of strategic materials and other primary products in Africa is
                        proceeding at a moderate pace. The present stage is one of consolidation
                        following a postwar period of fairly rapid increases in production. The
                        major bottlenecks at present are shortages of skilled workers and transport
                        facilities. Political problems are also impeding development progress in
                        some areas, e.g. French North Africa, Kenya. Post-Korean declines in metal
                        prices have not been a serious factor, because African output is relatively
                        low-cost.</p>

                        effect upon the foreign exchange position of exporting countries—Egypt,
                        Turkey and Pakistan. In Pakistan the loss of foreign exchange reserves was
                        temporarily halted by the U.S. wheat program and by drastic controls which
                        the Pakistan government imposed to cut the value of imports by one-half
                        during 1953.</p>

                        techniques. The widespread incidence of disease and high rate of illiteracy
                        require programs to provide elementary public health services and practical
                        education facilities. The low level of competence in managing public affairs
                        has made it necessary to introduce technical assistance in public
                        administration.</p>
                    <p>Noteworthy successes, as well as some failures, have been experienced, but in
                        the larger perspective of U.S. objectives real progress is not yet
                        measurable. In the underdeveloped Near East it has become apparent that
                        strength and stability require development on a broad base, and that it will
                        require several years of cooperative work to create the conditions which
                        will permit solutions to the area’s basic problems.</p>

                        grants. Israel’s foreign exchange expenditures continue to be 5 times as

                        of $73 million, also has to be serviced. External sources such as World
                        Jewry contributions, bond issues, German reparations, and U.S. aid cover the
                        deficit of approximately $220 million per year. During the first half of
                        fiscal 1953, the U.S. contribution was $26.25 million, with a similar amount
                        earmarked for the second half.</p>

                        thru March 1954. Until the oil dispute is settled and oil production begins
                        to yield income, Iran will require outside assistance. Once a settlement of

                        U.S. foreign policy in this crucial sector of the “uncommitted world”. These
                        programs operated in an atmosphere of difficulties arising from a stalemate
                        in the India-Pakistan dispute over Jammu and Kashmir, adverse reactions in
                        India and Afghanistan to Pakistan’s request for U.S. military aid, and
                        failure of the wheat crop in Pakistan. Offsetting these were encouraging
                        evidences of official and popular enthusiasm for U.S. economic aid and
                        technical cooperation in the four countries, testifying to the real though
                        moderate progress being made toward development objectives.</p>
                    <p>b. <hi rend="italic">India</hi></p>
                    <p>India, one of the largest, potentially most powerful nations of the world,
                        has a broad development program in which U.S. aid plays a vital though
                        financially minor role. Despite sporadic indications of official coolness on
                        the international front, the Indian attitude toward the <gloss
                            target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> program has changed, to a significant
                        degree, from initial suspicion to genuine cooperation and appreciation.</p>
                    <p>Food has been and will continue to be the most serious problem. Even with a
                        good crop year, it was necessary to import almost 2 million tons of food
                        grains in 1953. Recognizing that the primary element in the increase in food
                        production was favorable weather, <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709" facs="0735"
                        />some credit is nevertheless attributed to increased use of fertilizers,
                        new methods of cultivation, better seeds, and more and better tools.
                        Continuation and expansion of these influences, plus completion of
                        irrigation works which will bring millions of additional acres under
                        irrigation, are expected to show results of major significance beginning
                        with the 1954 crop year.</p>
                    <p>Most agricultural extension work, as well as projects in education, health,
                        rural transportation, and so on, is brought to the rural people through the
                        Community Development program. Nearly half the value of total improvements
                        has been from locally contributed labor. The program has met with such
                        success the Indian government is making it a major part of the Five Year
                        Plan.</p>
                    <p>Unemployment and underemployment in India are chronic, partly due to the high
                        rate of population increase—about 5 million per year. Recent increases in
                        unemployment have led to a new emphasis upon industrialization, and the U.S.
                        has contributed to Indian acceptance of the idea of an Industrial
                        Development Corporation to stimulate private enterprise.</p>

                        to Pakistan in 1953.]</p>
                    <p>When the present government in Pakistan came into power last April, it was
                        already faced with a serious foreign exchange shortage because export
                        earnings from jute and cotton had dropped nearly half. The failure of the
                        wheat crop had brought the country to the verge of famine and political
                        crisis. A large part of the country’s limited foreign exchange resources
                        went for food, with the result that imports had to be cut drastically and,
                        because of loss of customs revenues, the internal expenditure budget had to
                        be reduced. The Six Year Plan of development was discarded and a National
                        Planning Board was set up to formulate a new program.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. met the wheat crisis by donating up to 1 million tons of wheat, part
                        of which is being sold and the proceeds used for development projects. The
                        first phase of the wheat shipment, 700,000 tons, was 85% complete by 31
                        December. In addition to local currency generated by wheat sales, and funds
                        for the technical cooperation program, the U.S. is providing a grant of
                        $14.5 million to step up the pace of Pakistan’s economic development. Much
                        progress has been made in gaining the confidence and respect of the
                        officials and the people, and many technical cooperation projects, primarily
                        in agriculture and natural resources, are finally underway or about to
                        start.</p>

                    <p>In many areas of the Near East, Africa and South Asia, the demands for quick
                        agricultural expansion are resulting in major efforts to locate and exploit
                        underground water resources. Programs are well advanced in Greece and India
                        and are contemplated in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.</p>

                    <p>From its inception, the Mutual Security Program in the Far East (Burma,
                        Formosa, Indochina, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand)
                        has faced two major difficulties: (1) the diversity of problems, involving
                        both the countries themselves and the security interests of the US, and (2)
                        lack of regional defense and economic organizations capable of collective
                        action on area problems. The countries have certain common characteristics:
                        threatened or overt communist aggression or subversion; inability to resist
                        communist invasion (or communist supported subversion) without outside
                        assistance; and importance to US security interests.</p>
                    <p>In the absence of regional organizations, the most important unifying element
                        in facing up to problems of building military defense, furthering economic
                        development, and arresting economic deterioration, is the device of US
                        bilateral assistance arrangements with individual countries. <gloss
                            target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss> efforts have necessarily concentrated on
                        key countries, although regional considerations have exercised an increasing
                        influence on country programs.</p>
                    <p>Major US objectives with respect to the Far East are: (a) to prevent any
                        country in the region from passing into the communist orbit; (b) to assist
                        the free countries to develop the will and ability to resist communism from
                        within and without; (c) to assist the governments in their efforts to
                        achieve political and economic stability designed to enlist the support of
                        their own people; (d) to assist in the development of self-supporting
                        economies under independent, representative governments with pro-Western
                        orientation. These guidelines determine the nature and scope of <gloss
                            target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss> activities in the area.</p>
                    <p>It must be recognized, however, that US objectives are not fully coincident
                        with the aspirations of the leaders of several countries in the area,
                        notably in Formosa and Korea. The <gloss target="#t_NGRC1">NGRC</gloss>’s
                        principal objective is to find the necessary strength to return to the
                        mainland, whereas present US policy is based on the concept of a strategic
                            <pb n="713" xml:id="pg_713" facs="0739"/>reserve with more limited
                        offensive capabilities. The Republic of Korea considers the unification of
                        Korea its overriding objective, and has called for fulfillment of this
                        objective through military means; US policy is to work through peaceful
                        means toward eventual unification under an independent democratic
                        government.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. Regional Integration</hi></p>
                    <p>In late November, Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek jointly proposed a <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-type regional defense organization
                        encompassing all anti-communist governments in the Far East. The proposal
                        has not resulted in any military pact, nor does it have US sponsorship at
                        this time. The US would probably be expected to provide funds.</p>
                    <p>The closest approach to a regional economic organization—the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Economic Commission for Asia and the Far
                        East—provides a forum for discussion of production and marketing problems,
                        development programs, trade relationships, monetary arrangements, and
                        regional integration. No progress has been made in developing an
                        organization comparable to <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>. Economic
                        unification of the area depends substantially on Japan’s assuming to an
                        increasing degree the role of principal supplier of consumer goods and
                        principal consumer of raw materials. In 1953, high Japanese prices and
                        increased competition from Western sources retarded Japan’s exports to the
                        area. The total volume of intra-regional trade is declining rather than
                        increasing, the rise in Japan-Formosa trade being the major exception.</p>

                            Setting</hi></p>
                    <p>In the absence of regional organizations capable of attacking the pressing
                        economic and military problems, <gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss> efforts
                        have necessarily concentrated on key problems in individual countries. The
                            <gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss> ranges from technical cooperation
                        with modest provision of equipment (Indonesia) to major military assistance
                        and defense support (e.g. Formosa, where US aid is supporting the continued
                        existence of the <gloss target="#t_NGRC1">NGRC</gloss>). Major emphasis has
                        centered on military assistance to the French and Associated States forces
                        in Indochina—the key to the security of Southeast and South Asia; and
                        developing and maintaining <gloss target="#t_NGRC1">NGRC</gloss> forces on
                        Formosa. Of real but restricted value in Indochina, economic support of the
                        military effort has been of crucial importance in Formosa.</p>
                    <p>Thailand and the Philippines are also receiving both military assistance and
                        economic and technical assistance. Indonesia receives aid under the
                        technical assistance program. The Burma program has been discontinued (at
                        Burma’s request) and is being phased out.</p>
                    <p>Key programs in Korea and Japan will assume their true stature in the months
                        ahead. The Korean program, to date a reasonably <pb n="714" xml:id="pg_714"

                        formula, must now be tailored to meet the need for gradual industrial
                        rehabilitation while providing the consumer goods necessary to combat
                        mounting inflationary pressures. The US-Japanese military assistance
                        agreement will ultimately lead to an increased Japanese defense force and
                        defense production. Concurrently, the US interest demands that all possible
                        steps be taken to further the integration of the Japanese economy with the
                        rest of free Asia.</p>

                        trade imbalance; Indochina and Korea (with a combined import surplus of
                        nearly $650 million) showed imports which were respectively 5 and 8 times as
                        large as exports. Only Burma and Indonesia showed slight export
                        surpluses.</p>
                    <p>The 1953 payments gap was narrowed by net invisibles receipts of about $600
                        million, leaving a net payments deficit—excluding US aid programs—of over
                        $1.1 billion. Present indications are that the gap in <hi rend="italic"
                            >fiscal</hi> 1954 will be somewhat larger than that in <hi rend="italic"
                            >calendar</hi> 1953, with trade and normal invisibles continuing at the
                        1953 rate, and a slight decline in US Government expenditures other than
                        grants and loans.</p>
                    <p>Excluding military end-items, <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 US aid
                        programs for the Far East provide about $836 million in new funds and
                        unexpended obligations from previous years. Actual expenditures for supplies
                        and equipment in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 are expected to
                        amount to about $337 million. To this should be added $450 million in French
                        franc payments in Indochina, made possible by US budgetary assistance to <pb

                        war. Thus, US assistance programs will directly or indirectly provide a
                        total of about $787 million to meet the Far East trade and payments gap in

                    <p>Two facts stand out sharply: (1) US economic and technical assistance
                        programs in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 will cover almost
                        two-thirds of the $1213 million current accounts imbalance in the Far East
                        as a whole; (2) even more significant, the apparently favorable invisibles
                        balance is made possible solely by virtue of massive extraordinary US dollar
                        expenditures above and beyond US assistance programs. These expenditures
                        flow from Allied Force personnel expenditures, maintenance costs for US
                        forces, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> procurement, and military
                        construction activities in Japan; US Army hwan purchases in Korea; veterans,
                        US War Claims Commission, and military payments in the Philippines; and
                        modest but growing <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> offshore
                        procurement in Japan and Formosa. Totaling $1045 million in 1953 and about
                        $970 million in 1954, these expenditures outweigh the economic aid program
                        in meeting the area payments problem. Continuation of these expenditures is
                        largely dependent upon strategic military decisions—locus of military
                        production, deployment of US forces, etc. Nevertheless, future plans for
                        economic development in the Far East must to a considerable degree take
                        account of these decisions—with their inevitable economic impact. Both
                        present and projected levels of US military, economic, and technical
                        assistance grant aid, taken by themselves, represent a gross understatement
                        of the actual US dollar input toward the stability of the Far East.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows a chart depicting the Far East trade gap between 1950 and
                        1953.]</p>
                    <p>The US plans to remove two army divisions from Korea in 1954, resulting in an
                        estimated decline in special dollar payments from $120 million in 1953 to
                        $30 million per year in the future. Extraordinary US dollar expenditures in
                        Japan are also expected to decline <pb n="717" xml:id="pg_717" facs="0743"
                        />after 1954, as a result of the termination of hostilities in Korea.
                        Special expenditures in the Philippines will taper off gradually after 1955;
                        veterans’ payments, now about $100 million annually, are expected to drop.
                        Area-wise, it appears that unless radical improvement is made in trade and
                        payments balances in the next 12–18 months, the economic impact of declining
                        US dollar expenditures may prove to be serious.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">3. Marketing Problems</hi></p>
                    <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">Raw Materials</hi></p>
                    <p>Falling sales and declining world prices of raw materials during 1953 have
                        seriously reduced foreign exchange earnings of countries of Southeast Asia.
                        Tin and rubber prices fell by a third in 1953; rice has fallen by 15%, and
                        is expected to drop 20% from the present figure. Burma (rice), Thailand
                        (tin, rubber, rice), and Indonesia (tin, rubber) were particularly hard hit;
                        Indonesia, with exchange reserves already dangerously low, is in serious
                        difficulty. In addition, the expected US decision to discontinue purchase of
                        tungsten under GSA contract poses problems for Korea and, to a lesser
                        extent, Thailand.</p>
                    <p>Marketing failures are in some cases attributable to factors beyond the
                        control of the exporting nations. Termination of tin purchases for the US
                        stockpile left world tin production a full 25% above present or prospective
                        demand. Rubber, too, is seriously affected by virtual cessation of US
                        stockpile purchases, although in this case the long range demand outlook is
                        more favorable.</p>
                    <p>Rice is faced with increasing competition from North American grain surpluses
                        and unwillingness of Japan and India—normal importing nations—to pay the
                        still inflated prices. In addition, virtual self-sufficiency in rice in the
                        Philippines and Korea, and increased rice production in Indonesia has
                        further reduced the potential export market. Large carryover stocks and
                        declining salability abroad have depressed domestic prices in Burma and
                        Thailand, interfered with normal movements from farmer to market, and
                        strained storage capacity. The poor crop in Japan may offer a partial and
                        temporary solution to the problem of surplus rice in Thailand, and
                        particularly in Burma. Burmese rice is acceptable to the Japanese—at a
                        price. One result of substantially increased purchases from Burma would be a
                        decline in sales to Japan of US rice. If a distressed US rice market were to
                        result in anything appearing to be a US rice-disposal program, the political
                        and psychological impact in Southeast Asia would be serious. Indeed, US
                        loans and grants of wheat are already having an adverse effect in the
                        rice-exporting countries with which, in a sense, the US is competitive.</p>
                    <pb n="718" xml:id="pg_718" facs="0744"/>
                    <p>Significantly, many of the countries affected by marketing failures have
                        received trade offers from communist China. Indonesia has even concluded a
                        trade agreement with China, calling for shipment of tin and rubber, among
                        other items, although to date no shipments have been made. Continuation of
                        the marketing impasse might result in acceptance of communist trade offers,
                        with concomitantly increased dependence on the Soviet Bloc.</p>
                    <p>(b) <hi rend="italic">Manufactured Goods</hi></p>
                    <p>The overwhelming bulk of Far Eastern industrial capacity is concentrated in
                        Japan, which formerly supplied much of the area’s needs for manufactured
                        goods. While Japanese industrial production in 1953 was 15% higher than in
                        1952, and 48% higher than prewar, high domestic prices made export markets
                        less attractive, and Japanese products became less competitive. Western
                        Europe and North America supplied an increasing proportion of Japan’s
                        “normal” export market; further, the underdeveloped countries of the area
                        are with few exceptions attempting economic diversification and reduction in
                        imports of consumer goods.</p>
                    <p>(c) <hi rend="italic">Impact</hi></p>
                    <p>Area marketing problems have not yet been resolved. It is clear, however,
                        that low quality and/or high cost are rendering exports of Far Eastern
                        countries uncompetitive vis-à-vis cheaper or more readily available
                        substitutes. Increased production has not been achieved; shortage of
                        capital, high interest rates, and internal inflationary pressures have kept
                        production and marketing cost high. Further, excessive reliance on one or
                        two commodities has rendered the raw materials producers excessively
                        vulnerable to fluctuating demand and shifts in terms of trade.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows a chart indicating various aspects of rice production in “Free
                        Asia” with 1938 and 1953 used as contrasting base years.]</p>
                    <p>In recognition of the marketing problem, the US is assisting in stabilizing
                        markets for tin and rubber. While a recent <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> decision precludes US participation in the International
                        Tin Agreement favored by the producing nations, some 40,000 tons of
                        non-stockpile tin now held by <gloss target="#t_RFC1">RFC</gloss> will be
                        insulated from the market, together with 20,000 tons to be purchased from
                        Indonesia—withdrawals to be made only at the direction of the President. The
                        rubber market has been bolstered by revisions in stockpile rotation
                        practices, reductions in mandatory use of synthetic rubber, and shutdown of
                        US-owned alcohol rubber plants.</p>
                    <p>Resolution of the long-range problems facing the underdeveloped countries of
                        Southeast Asia lies, in large measure, in coordinated economic
                        diversification and solution of the marketing impasse. Funds for such
                        diversification will flow only in part from external <pb n="719"
                            xml:id="pg_719" facs="0745"/>grants and loans and from private foreign
                        capital investment. More importantly, they must flow from public and private
                        local capital. Failure to solve the problem of marketing the raw materials
                        produced by these countries would seriously imperil the US objective of
                        increasing economic, political, and social stability. Since declining export
                        sales are directly reflected in national income and government revenues,
                        these countries would be unwilling or unable to devote needed resources to
                        the implementation of development plans. In short, continuation of the 1953
                        marketing failures could result in retrogression of the Far East toward
                        economic and political crisis in place of the planned advance to more solid
                        ground via development programs.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">4. Agricultural Production</hi></p>
                    <p>Area-wise, the most favorable development during 1953 was the general rise in
                        agricultural production. While Japan suffered a 20% failure in the rice crop
                        (a loss of $300 million) and a $50 million decline in other grains, every
                        other country in the area held even with or showed a marked rise over
                        general agricultural production in the previous year, with food production
                        improvement even more pronounced. Thailand showed a total agricultural
                        production index of 181 (1935–39 = 100); the Philippines (125) and Indonesia
                        (114) were also well above prewar; Korea, with an index of 95, showed a 14%
                        improvement over 1952—percentagewise the largest improvement in the
                        area.</p>
                    <p>This favorable picture results from exceptionally good conditions this year,
                        and should not be regarded as a trend. Furthermore, population increases
                        have more than wiped out these production gains on a per capita basis. Only
                        Thailand, with an index of 138, showed per capita production above prewar
                        levels. Indonesia’s per capita general index of 97 appeared relatively close
                        to prewar, although the figure was inflated by heavy production of
                        industrial agricultural commodities, and per capita food production was only
                        about 88% of prewar.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">5. Public Administration</hi></p>
                    <p>In the final analysis, the struggle between the Free World and the Soviet
                        Bloc for the allegiance of the Far East depends on the effectiveness of the
                        local governments and the extent of their popular support. The technical
                        assistance program to assist in increasing government effectiveness may have
                        a greater ultimate impact than physical shipments of supplies and
                        equipment.</p>
                    <p>Japan excepted, the Far East faces a serious lack of trained technical
                        personnel at nearly all levels. This lack underlies the serious internal
                        weaknesses in the organizational structure and administrative procedures of
                        both central and provincial governments <pb n="720" xml:id="pg_720"
                            facs="0746"/>throughout the area. While recognizing these deficiencies,
                        the governments of several of these nations have been reluctant to request
                        extensive US technical guidance in a field which appears to impinge on
                        national sovereignty. Hopefully, this reluctance appears to be breaking
                        down, as (1) the need for better use of all available resources has become
                        more clearly evident, (2) host governments have begun to assume more
                        responsibility for mutually sponsored economic and social development
                        programs in public health, agricultural extension, and similar areas, and
                        (3) the impediments to progress posed by inequities and inadequacies of
                        existing statistical practices, budget techniques, tax collection methods
                        and tax laws have become more glaringly apparent.</p>
                    <p>Progress in Formosa in 1953 was impressive in contrast with the area average.
                        Military budgets and expenditures were brought more under civilian control
                        and total budget estimates are the most carefully calculated and justified
                        in Chinese history. The reorganized Economic Stabilization Board provides a
                        more effective central source for economic planning. The US concept of a
                        joint import program was adopted to enable more efficient use of foreign
                        exchange for development purposes. The land reform program reached the stage
                        of actual transfer of farm land to over 200,000 new owners. US
                        recommendations to increase revenues were put into practice to meet the
                        current budget deficit, and the government moved toward adoption of a more
                        realistic exchange rate. The <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> program is
                        thus approaching the stage where development of capacity for self-support
                        can take equal priority with maintenance of economic stability as a focus of
                        US attention.</p>
                    <p>In the Philippines, progress in public administration projects was
                        accelerated. The Government was more receptive to technical assistance in
                        labor, fiscal, and trade policy; and progress was made in the development of
                        facilities for rural credit, implementation of tax measures, improvement in
                        import control administration, and implementation of the Industrial Peace
                        Act. With the advent of the Magsaysay Administration, US technicians were
                        requested to assist in government streamlining. Revitalization of the
                        National Economic Council, with extended authority over the country’s
                        economic development program, is expected to be the first product of this
                        technical collaboration.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, progress in improving public administration in Indochina,
                        Thailand, and Indonesia has been slight or non-existent. In Indochina, the
                        Pau accords<note n="17" xml:id="d196fn17">At the Pau Conference, which

                        guidance at the policy level in public administration, fiscal, and related
                        fields, although <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> programs have
                        contributed to strengthening the services of individual ministries. War
                        conditions have forced concentration of the aid program into areas of direct
                        need—transportation, refugee care, health, sanitation, agriculture,
                        etc.—with little progress toward resource development, fiscal, or financial
                        reform.</p>
                    <p>Thailand has been slow in seeking US guidance in public administration, with
                        the minor exception of advice in tax collection methods. Indonesia may
                        request aid in the broad public administration field under the <gloss

                    <p>Developments in the Philippines and Formosa constitute the end-product of
                        three years of US technical assistance. Lasting improvement in the fields of
                        public administration, fiscal and budget measures, taxation administration,
                        etc., is not a short run matter. While it is unwise to generalize from
                        specific instances, the possibility should not be overlooked that, in
                        matters appearing to touch national sovereignty, more rapid progress might
                        be achieved by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> than by US technicians.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">6. Private Investment</hi></p>
                    <p>Generation of internal capital is difficult in all of the underdeveloped
                        nations of the Far East by reason of low average income and almost total
                        lack of mechanisms for accumulating private savings. As such mechanisms
                        develop, the rate of domestic private investment may be expected slowly to
                        increase; in the interim, economic development will depend largely upon
                        local and foreign public capital, and eventually, private foreign
                        investment.</p>
                    <p>The general insecurity of much of the Far East continues to preclude
                        extensive private foreign investment. Unfavorable investment climate is a
                        major barrier in several countries. On the material side, the inadequacy of
                        road, rail, power, and port facilities must be overcome through public
                        capital investment before extensive external or internal private capital can
                        be employed. Equally important is the need to remedy the institutional
                        barriers to investment arising from the shortage of managerial and technical
                        skills, inadequate public services, disease incidence, and low
                        productivity.</p>
                    <p>Most countries in the area continue to pay at least lip service to the
                        concept of private foreign investment as a major tool in their economic—and
                        particularly industrial—development programs. Indonesia, for example, is
                        reportedly on the point of revising the investment laws to attract outside
                        capital; the Chinese Government on Formosa has acknowledged the inadequacy
                        of its foreign investment <pb n="722" xml:id="pg_722" facs="0748"
                        />legislation, and is actively considering a new US-sponsored law.</p>
                    <p>On balance, however, recent progress has not been encouraging. On the plus
                        side, some US private capital has finally moved into Formosa, although the
                        volume is still small; US petroleum companies have increased their prior
                        investments in Indonesia; US investors are displaying more active interest
                        in Japan, although Japanese authorities are reluctant to accept foreign
                        control of enterprise. The volume of foreign investment in the area has not
                        been large, however; the total value of US direct private investment
                        (including reinvested earnings of earlier investments) has in no year since
                        the war exceeded $75 million. Incomplete figures for 1953 indicate a
                        considerable shortfall from that amount, with Japan and Indonesia as major
                        recipients. Nor does the immediate future appear brighter: neither Burma nor
                        Thailand possesses the necessary facilities to attract outside capital in
                        substantial volume; both Korea and Indochina appear to be too risky from a
                        security standpoint. Japan, Formosa, and the Philippines appear in position
                        to receive favorable consideration by foreign investors. Indonesia’s
                        development potential may in time attract large-scale private investment; at
                        present, with the possible exception of further petroleum development, most
                        investment possibilities appear to lie in areas where foreign capital would
                        not find it prudent to invest.</p>

                    <p>Latin America’s remarkable postwar economic growth is evident in the average
                        annual increase of 5.6% in the area’s gross national product at constant
                        prices from 1946 through 1951. The period of rapid progress ended abruptly,
                        however, with overall <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> actually declining
                        in real terms during 1952 and barely recovering to the 1951 level in
                        1953.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows a chart indicating the way in which population increases
                        outpaced the rise in gross national product and food production in Latin
                        America between 1950 and 1953.]</p>
                    <p>In the absence of production expansion, the persistent annual population
                        increase of 2.5% led to reductions in the average Latin American standard of
                        living as measured by per capita income in both 1952 and 1953. The declines
                        generally took the form of reduced availability of food. <gloss

                    <p>The recent slackening of economic progress relates in part to imbalances
                        generated by the development efforts of the Latin American countries
                        themselves and in part to changes in external factors such as international
                        commodity markets.</p>

                    <p>The numerous recent evidences of imbalance in Latin American development
                        include payments crises, inflation, food and power shortages, and reduced
                        petroleum production.</p>
                    <p>Although Latin America’s aggregate holdings of gold and dollars increased by
                        an estimated $252 million during 1953, critical payments situations
                        developed in several countries, notably Brazil and Bolivia. Moreover, the
                        overall rise in reserves would not have occurred without the Export-Import
                        Bank’s loan of $300 million to Brazil necessitated by a pressing backlog of
                        commercial debts. In Peru, unfavorable year-end trends brought the
                        sol-dollar exchange rate from 17.85 in October to 21.89 on January 26th. The
                        President of Peru has requested a short term stabilization loan from the
                        U.S. Treasury, particularly with a view to improving psychological attitudes
                        on the exchange market.</p>
                    <p>Inflation is a problem of serious proportions in Bolivia and Paraguay. The
                        cost of living has risen by 135% in La Paz and 72% in Asuncion during the
                        past year. Inflationary pressures are continuing to a lesser, but still
                        critical, extent in Brazil and Chile.</p>
                    <p>Food supply has become a major problem owing to population growth and
                        under-emphasis on agricultural development. Food output per capita in
                        1952–53 was only 96% of the prewar quantity. Chronic food deficits exist in
                        some countries, e.g. Haiti, and famine conditions have occasionally
                        developed in various regions, e.g., the food shortage in early 1952 causing
                        the migration of some 300,000 persons from northeastern Brazil.</p>
                    <p>Electric power rationing is a common necessity in Latin American cities. In
                        view of the great need for rapid expansion in this sector, the rise of 8.7%
                        in production during 1953 appears small in comparison with the increase of
                        11.5% achieved in the U.S.</p>
                    <p>Latin American production of crude oil declined about 2% in 1953 as compared
                        with average annual increases of 11% from 1949 through 1952. Reduced levels
                        of output were recorded not only by the major producer, Venezuela, but also
                        in Bolivia, Mexico, and Peru. Latin American heavy crudes were facing soft
                        markets with Middle East production substantially increased and U.S. imports
                        reduced. The reversal of the production trend represents a foreign exchange
                        loss and also aggravates fuel and energy shortages.</p>

                    <p>Although strengthened and diversified by post war programs for domestic
                        development, most Latin American economies are still dominated by
                        international commodity markets. Exports of primary goods are the principal
                        source of income to finance imports <pb n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0751"
                        />for current consumption and equipment required in implementation of
                        development projects.</p>
                    <p>Substantial improvement in terms of trade was a major dynamic factor in Latin
                        America’s wartime and postwar economic growth. In October 1953 the area’s
                        terms of trade were still 64% more favorable than in 1938, following a
                        decline of about 10% from the average in the peak year 1951. Post Korean
                        price developments have had little impact on the aggregate Latin American
                        terms of trade, but the effects in individual countries have ranged from
                        crisis in tin-exporting Bolivia to general prosperity in the
                        coffee-exporting countries.</p>
                    <p>The Latin American countries are aware of U.S. policy directed toward
                        liberalization of trade and are disturbed by recent actual or proposed
                        increases in U.S. import restrictions on lead, zinc, fuel oil, wool and
                        oats. A number of individual trade and commodity problems continue to
                        irritate economic relations between the U.S. and some of the Latin American
                        countries. Uruguay, for example, has objected strongly to the U.S. decision
                        that the preferential treatment by Uruguay of wool top exports was
                        tantamount to a subsidy and that a compensatory duty on such imports was
                        mandatory. Chile complained formally to the State Department regarding the
                        alleged loss of her nitrate market in Greece due to unfair competition from
                        U.S. exports of ammonium sulphate produced in plants which were purchased by
                        present owners from the U.S. Government at 20% of cost. The Chilean
                        Government has also felt that we should buy for stockpile in return for
                        their promise to solve the internal copper problem and not to sell to
                        Russia.</p>

                    <p>Latin America’s potential for development has been demonstrated by postwar
                        progress. The need for even more rapid development is evident in all of the
                        available indicators of living standards. The insistent demands of the
                        population for immediate economic improvement have an important bearing on
                        internal politics and are of great importance in U.S. relations with the
                        Latin American countries.</p>
                    <p>Development progress depends on three principal factors, all of which may be
                        affected by internal political considerations in the Latin American
                        countries: (1) realistic country development plans, (2) availability of
                        investment capital, and (3) technical progress.</p>

                    <p>A majority of the Latin American countries now have economic development

                    <p>Experience of Latin American governments in the development field has led to

                        fuel and energy sources, and transport facilities. One major error in past
                        planning has been corrected by new emphasis on food production in some
                        countries, e.g. Mexico, Argentina, and Chile. Regional planning efforts by
                        the Central American republics, by Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Argentina may or
                        may not be another constructive step, depending on the nature of the
                        results.</p>

                        particularly through provision of the technical knowledge on which country

                        organizing effectively for development planning. U.S. responsibility for
                        actual planning decisions has usually been avoided, however, except in
                        response to specific invitation as in the case of the Joint Development
                        Commission in Brazil. International organizations have a unique opportunity
                        in this field because their advice is likely to be more acceptable than that

                    <p>Realization of Latin America’s potential for economic development will
                        require a huge investment of private and public capital from both domestic
                        and foreign sources over an extended period. Since World War II total
                        domestic and foreign investment in Latin America has averaged about $7
                        billion annually, with domestic investment accounting for over 90% of the

                    <p>Over 90% of total investment in Latin America since World War II has been
                        provided by domestic capital. From 1946 through 1952 the Latin American
                        countries invested an average of some 16% of their <gloss target="#t_GNP1"
                            >GNP</gloss> annually. Private investment accounts for the major portion

                        investment has increased in quantitative and qualitative importance. A
                        substantial share of domestic investment has taken the form of relatively
                        unproductive types of construction, speculative commercial ventures, and
                        investments in consumer goods industries not directly serving development

                    <p>Until 1948 the U.S. Export-Import Bank was the principal source of foreign

                    <p>Latin America shared in the accelerated growth of U.S. private direct
                        investment abroad during 1950–52, but to lesser extent than other areas,
                        (i.e. up 25% as compared with 48% elsewhere). The total book value is now
                        about $6 billion with Venezuela and Brazil each accounting for over $1
                        billion. The Brazilian total rose from $588 million at end of 1949 to $1,013
                        million at end of 1952. Petroleum is still the principal sector (over
                        one-fourth of the Latin American total), but investments in manufacturing
                        and in mining have been gaining rapidly in recent years.</p>
                    <p>During 1952 U.S. private direct investment in Latin America amounted to $582
                        million, of which $278 million represented net inflow of new capital and
                        $304 million undistributed subsidiary earnings. In 1953 estimated net inflow
                        of new capital dropped to $113 million, with undistributed earnings staying
                        at $304 million. Recent changes in the private investment climate appear to
                        be generally unfavorable. An intense spirit of economic nationalism
                        continues to operate against the desire and the need for development.</p>
                    <p>Although the main responsibility for improving the private investment climate
                        must rest with the country governments, there are a number of important U.S.
                        measures in effect or being developed to increase the incentive of U.S.
                        investors. Since the fundamental incentive for private investment is the
                        anticipation of favorable markets, the major potential U.S. contribution in
                        this field lies in fuller implementation of the established policy of
                        encouraging Latin America exports to the U.S. The <gloss target="#t_MSP1"

                        limited to a contract with Haiti, will be given a further trial with
                        coverage extended to risks of war, revolution, and insurrection (as
                        recommended by the Randall Commission), in addition to the present coverage
                        for risks of expropriation and inconvertibility. Another possibility for
                        U.S. action is through tax incentive measures as recommended by Dr.
                        Eisenhower and the Randall Commission. Finally, opportunities frequently
                        arise for private investment directly related to U.S. technical assistance
                        programs, e.g. the du Pont plant for insecticides in Peru, Bethlehem’s

                    <p>Maintenance of equipment has in general been satisfactory. Some problems have

                        American countries have been slow to take advantage of U.S. training

                    <p>At your meeting today with Messrs. Stassen, Kyes and Dodge,<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d197fn2">No record of such meeting has been found.</note> an
                        effort will be made to resolve certain questions relating to the <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 Mutual Security Program. Among the
                        points which may be discussed are the following:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The form of legislation</hi></p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> has prepared consolidated legislation
                        repealing all existing statutes on foreign assistance and reenacting their
                        provisions, including those on organization, in a single organic statute.
                        The Secretary has indicated that he prefers the method of amending the
                        existing laws since this will not prejudice the long-term organizational
                        arrangements. However, it is possible to draft a bill which will meet the
                        objections of the Department by omitting any references to organizational
                        matters and the Act for International Development and simply consolidate the
                        substantive provisions of the statutes governing military and economic
                        aid.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Appropriation of military aid funds and their merger
                            with Department of Defense appropriation</hi></p>
                    <p>The problem is whether military aid funds should be appropriated directly to
                        Defense or to the President. In the latter case they would be under Mr.
                        Stassen’s control. This question is not of direct concern to the Department.
                        However, it is absolutely essential from a foreign policy point of view that
                        regardless of where the funds are finally appropriated, arrangements be made
                        to assure (a) adequate foreign policy guidance and control in the
                        development and execution of military assistance programs, and (b)
                        satisfactory reporting to the Department on progress and status of these
                        programs.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Administration and coordination of the foreign aid
                            programs</hi></p>
                    <p>It has generally been agreed that for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955
                        the existing arrangements, with <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>
                        responsible for administration and coordination, subject to foreign policy
                        guidance from the Secretary, should be continued.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Coverage of the Military Assistance
                        Appropriation</hi></p>
                    <p>The question here is whether the military aid appropriation should include
                        funds for support of the Navarre Plan in Indo-China and certain common-use
                        programs. We believe that funds for these programs should be sought as a
                        part of the military assistance programs since their justification is
                        directly related to military activities. <pb n="731" xml:id="pg_731"
                            facs="0757"/>They should, however, be clearly identified from the
                        end-item program and probably be administered by <gloss target="#t_FOA1"
                            >FOA</gloss> with assistance from Defense.</p>
                    <p>Another subject which you may wish to mention at the meeting is the problem
                        of improving the present arrangements for bringing to bear foreign policy
                        considerations on the military programs during their formulation and
                        implementation on a more continuing basis. While present arrangements have
                        functioned satisfactorily, they can be improved considerably to avoid the
                        difficulties and delays that frequently occur. Recent examples of this
                        problem are “Plan K”<note n="3" xml:id="d197fn3">For documentation on Plan
                            K, see <ref target="frus1952-54v06p1">volume <hi rend="smallcaps"

                        on off-shore procurement. A move in this direction might be to provide for
                        State attending meetings of the Munitions Allocations Council (a Defense
                        committee on which <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> sits as an
                        observer).</p>

                    </list>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> has prepared a draft bill which
                        consolidates all foreign assistance legislation. This draft raises three
                        principal issues, one substantive and two organizational, which should be
                        settled at this time.</p>
                    <p>1. Substantive issue: Should the Act for International Development be
                        repealed and reenacted as a part of the consolidated bill?</p>
                    <p>The present <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> draft includes the AID in the
                        consolidated bill. We have taken the position the AID should not be repealed
                        and reenacted. Consultation with Congressional leaders discloses a
                        preference to have the consolidated legislation provide all authority to
                        give assistance, including the AID. In light of this Congressional
                        sentiment, it is recommended that you concur in Mr. Stassen’s position that
                        the AID should be included in the bill now being drafted but take the
                        position that we should be prepared to change our position and delete the
                        AID if it later appears that its inclusion will result in amendments
                        adversely affecting the program.</p>
                    <p>2. Organizational issues:</p>
                    <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0758"/>
                    <p>a. Organizational arrangements in Washington.</p>
                    <p>We have taken the position that existing organizational arrangements,
                        contained in Reorganization Plan No. 7 and related documents, should be
                        continued. The <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> draft legislation
                        provides for a Foreign Operations Administration and for the position of
                        coordinator as a part of the basic statute. Reorganization Plan No. 7 would
                        be repealed. Such legislative provisions would not achieve the balance
                        between agencies under the present complex of documents of which
                        Reorganization Plan 7 is a part. It is unnecessary in order to continue
                        existing arrangements to spell those out in the new legislation. It is
                        suggested that you take the position that to ask Congress to enact into law
                        organizational arrangements would risk precipitating in this year’s
                        presentation a major and unnecessary issue, and would also require the
                        President to go back to Congress if he should wish to change such
                        arrangements in the future. Therefore, we should continue existing
                        arrangements under Reorganization Plan 7.</p>
                    <p>b. Organizational arrangements overseas.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> draft bill would require that
                        “special missions” of the European type be continued indefinitely wherever
                        they now exist, regardless of the size of assistance programs, and that new
                        such missions be created in additional countries if the Secretary of State
                        agrees. The bill would also require that the chief <gloss target="#t_FOA1"
                            >FOA</gloss> officers in all countries receive the pay and allowances of
                        Class 3 or 4 chiefs of mission, regardless of the size of assistance
                        programs. We understand, however, that Mr. Stassen is prepared to accord his
                        views with yours on the subject of overseas missions. If the legislation is
                        silent on Washington organization, it would follow logically that no
                        provision would be included on overseas organization (except for any
                        authority required to pay appropriate salaries to top <gloss
                            target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> personnel overseas). It is recommended that
                        you take the position that, in any event, no legislative provisions should
                        be included which would prevent continuation of existing field arrangements
                        (including Executive Order 10476<note n="2" xml:id="d198fn2">For Executive
                            Order 10476, dated Aug. 1, 1953, concerning the administration of
                            foreign aid and foreign information functions, see 18 <hi rend="italic"
                                >Federal Register</hi> 4537.</note>) or prejudice more complete
                        integration in overseas missions or the phasing out of existing “special
                        missions” where assistance programs are being substantially reduced or
                        liquidated. You will recall that you recommended to Mr. Stassen in September
                        that separate aid missions should be liquidated in a number of European
                        countries; the proposed legislation would require the continuation of such
                        missions.</p>
                    <p>3. Level of aid to Israel.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stassen may raise the question of the level of aid to Israel in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955. Because of favorable developments in
                        Israel’s economic outlook, there is reason to think that grants to Israel
                        can be substantially reduced next year. It is suggested that you reserve the
                        Department’s position on this subject pending consideration of staff work
                        now underway.</p>

                            >Mar. 18.</note> with Mr. Stassen, I tried to debrief the Secretary on
                        his dinner with Mr. Stassen and all I could get was the following
                        fragmentary report. If this is inadequate or does not make sense let me know
                        and I will go back to the charge.</p>

                        related to the presentation of the 1955 economic and military aid programs
                        and make definitive recommendations for his consideration.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Humphrey will act as chairman, and the other members of the
                        committee will be Under Secretary Smith of State, Deputy Secretary Kyes of
                        Defense, Director Stassen of Foreign Operations Administration, and Director
                        Dodge of Budget.</p>
                    <p>The principal issues which will need consideration are:</p>

                        allocated by him directly to <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, including
                        authority to merge <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> funds with <gloss
                            target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> funds.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Presentation.</hi>—Measures to ensure that the

                            target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> program does not inherently involve a
                        later substantial transfer of these funds to other economic programs, as
                        historically has been the case.</p>
                    <p>A means of reducing these transfers to an absolute minimum and only as a
                        result of complete justification and careful consideration, while
                        maintaining the principle and authority for flexible transferability to meet
                        unforseen real emergencies.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Programming.</hi>—The responsibility for handling the
                        programming of <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> funds in terms of any
                        general policy issues related to programming and expenditure and also in
                        terms of the day-to-day operations and details.</p>
                    <p>The above issue emphasizes the need for a method of maintaining the “country
                        team” concept while giving greater emphasis to practical military
                        requirements which may later be modified by political or other economic
                        policy considerations.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Commitments and expenditures.</hi>—Measures to ensure
                        adequate consideration of any requirements for new funds because no funds
                        apparently are available for the purpose.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Other subjects.</hi>—The committee may also be asked to
                        consider related matters such as some method of reviewing proposed dollar
                        commitments to be made by executive personnel overseas, which are additions
                        to existing programs, before these become binding on the Government.</p>

                        been made already. He emphasized the necessity for direct handling of the
                            <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> programs, prevention of
                        duplication and unnecessary costs, the lessening of the wasteful revisions

                        established.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hughes pointed out that the immediate questions to be resolved, and which
                        were not involved in the presentations by Mr. Stassen to which Secretary
                        Humphrey referred, related to the method of handling appropriations and
                        technical matters, not the amount of the programs. He said there were two
                        matters pending; one, the bill which had to be presented to the substantive
                        committees of the Congress; and the other, a report on action which the
                        Bureau of the Budget and the other interested agencies had been requested to
                        make by the Appropriations Committees concerning the merging of mutual
                        military assistance with Defense Department funds. Mr. Hughes said that all
                        matters had been agreed upon and a draft of the report had been accepted,
                        after revisions, by all parties, except for three points: <list>

                    <p>President Eisenhower submitted his Special Message to the Congress on the
                        Mutual Security program for fiscal year 1955 on June 23, 1954. The President
                        stated that his recommendations were “essential to the efforts of the United
                        States in the fields of international relations and national defense.” He
                        added that the Mutual Security program was “based upon the sound premise
                        that there can be no safety for any of us except in cooperative efforts to
                        build and sustain the strength of all free peoples. Above all else communist
                        strategy seeks to divide, to isolate, to weaken. The mutual security program
                        is an important means by which to counter this strategy.” He asked Congress
                        to authorize new appropriations in the amount of approximately $3.5 billion,
                        which represented about a 40 percent reduction in the Mutual Security
                        program in 2 years. “Because the new program is in large measure a
                        continuation of existing programs,” he added, “its success requires
                        reauthorization for expenditure of funds that are still unexpended.” The
                        President recommended that his $3.5 billion request be allocated as follows:
                        approximately $900 million for Europe; $570 million for the Near East,
                        Africa, and South Asia; $1,770 million for the Far East and <pb n="737"

                        and $165 million for non-regional programs. The President’s Special Message

                                to the Senate version for reasons (1) that it opens up an

                                pressure from the French, and (2) that cutting off the pipeline from

                                commodities should be included in the law. Existing agreements
                                require 10 percent set-aside for European countries and varying
                                amounts from approximately 5 to 10 percent, in other countries.
                                There has arisen no shortage of funds for U.S. use as a result of
                                the discretionary power in the Executive Branch to agree with other
                                countries in the amounts to be reserved for our use. We consider it
                                unnecessary to set a mandatory 10 percent provision and feel that it
                                would cause difficulty and perhaps injury to programs in
                                re-negotiating existing agreements, as would be required under the
                                House proposal. Your reassurance on this point, I believe, is all
                                that is necessary to achieve Senate support of our position.</item>

                                you reply along the following lines: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                        guaranteed the maintenance of the territorial <hi

                        of all foreign aid programs and the operation of the economic and technical

                        general direction of the military assistance program.</p>
                    <p>4. I am advised that the Bureau of the Budget has prepared and circulated to
                        interested agencies for comment a draft Executive Order to deal with certain
                        administrative and organizational aspects of the mutual security
                            program.<note n="4" xml:id="d205fn4">Not found in Department of State
                            files, but see Annex C, below.</note> Attached is an explanatory
                        statement prepared by the Bureau of the Budget on what it considers to be
                        the major points in its draft of a Mutual Security Program Executive Order
                        and the accompanying Presidential letter (See Annex C). Certain of these
                        points may have to be referred to the Special Committee for further
                        discussion. It would seem appropriate for the Bureau of the Budget to
                        complete its work on the Executive Order before the Planning Board
                        undertakes whatever further action in this field may be suitable.</p>
                    <p>5. After consideration of this subject, I have come to regard it as having
                        two main aspects. One aspect is the administrative and organizational set-up
                        which will make possible flexible handling of the military assistance
                        program. The second aspect of providing flexibility concerns a periodic
                        review of current programming of unexpended <gloss target="#t_MDAP1"
                            >MDAP</gloss> funds in the light of the availability of end-items,
                        relative priority among recipient nations, and current U.S. objectives,
                        strategic concepts, etc.</p>
                    <p>6. With respect to the first aspect, the Department of Defense has submitted
                        to the Bureau of the Budget its views on the draft Executive Order. I have
                        also transmitted Mr. Hensel’s preliminary memorandum to the Director of the
                        Bureau of the Budget for consideration, in connection with its study of the
                        proposed Executive Order. When the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        Office receives from the Department of Defense the report requested of it, I
                        will see that appropriate parts <pb n="742" xml:id="pg_742" facs="0768"
                        />thereof are also transmitted to the Director of the Bureau of the Budget
                        for consideration.</p>
                    <p>7. With respect to the first aspect of this subject, I therefore recommend: <list>
                            <label>a.</label>
                            <item>That the Special Committee take prompt action on any unresolved
                                issues referred to it by the Bureau of the Budget on the proposed
                                Executive Order, and that the latter be transmitted to you for
                                signature as soon as possible,</item>
                            <label>b.</label>
                            <item>That the Planning Board suspend consideration of the
                                administrative and organizational aspects of this subject.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>8. With respect to the second aspect of this subject, I recommend that the
                        Planning Board give urgent consideration to developing recommendations, for
                        submission to the Council, as to a mechanism to provide a periodic over-all
                        review for the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> of the broad aspects of
                        the military assistance program, such as force levels, priorities and
                        allocations of end-items and production capacities included in all
                        uncompleted military assistance programs (totaling at June 30, 1954
                        approximately $7.6 billion), in the light of U.S. security objectives,
                        strategic concepts and other relevant considerations, and with the objective
                        of obtaining the best possible balance in terms of U.S. security. The first
                        of these reviews should, in connection with <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss>, consider the possibility that General Gruenther’s “New

                        approved the use of nearly $2.5 billion in unobligated funds from previous
                        years, bringing the total to $5.2 billion. The bulk of the new funds are for
                        military assistance ($2.4 billion), reflecting the shift in emphasis away
                        from economic aid, for which only $184.5 million is appropriated in contrast
                        with $4.4 billion appropriated for that purpose in the peak year of 1948.
                        Further, the Mutual Security Act specifically provides for termination of
                        development assistance by June 1955. Not less than $200 million of the aid
                        funds are to be used for loans. These are repayable in dollars, local
                        currencies or materials, and are to be administered through the <gloss

                        Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954. Stipulation is included that
                        these sales are to be in accordance with the standards as to pricing and the
                        use of private trade channels expressed in that Act (see above). The
                        appropriation legislation further stipulates that $55 million of the
                        unobligated balances shall be available only for the procurement and sale of
                        surplus <pb n="746" xml:id="pg_746" facs="0772"/>agricultural commodities as
                        assistance to Spain during the current fiscal year. It is further provided
                        that 80% of the foreign currencies generated thereunder shall be used to
                        strengthen and improve the civilian economy of Spain, the balance to be
                        available for use of the US, provided however that this provision should not
                        be construed as a precedent or as an abrogation of any agreement heretofore
                        entered into.</p>
                    <p>The Act specifically provides for abolition of the Foreign Operations
                        Administration by June 30, 1955. The President may transfer aid
                        administration to any agency he chooses, except that the Act specifically
                        states that technical cooperation is to be administered by the State
                        Department following termination of <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>. The
                        Congressional objective is that further aid programs necessary in the US
                        interest will thereafter be administered by permanent executive
                        departments.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Struve</hi>: Confirming our luncheon discussion, it
                        is my suggestion that we proceed under the President’s Executive Order as
                        now drafted<note n="1" xml:id="d207fn1">Draft copy not found, but see the
                            editorial note, <ref target="#pg_792">p. 792</ref>.</note> to implement
                        the Mutual Security Program for Fiscal Year 1955.</p>
                    <p>May I assure you that I have no intention under my powers as coordinator to
                        endeavor to “control” or “supervise” the activities of the Department of
                        Defense in carrying out their responsibilities in the program.</p>
                    <p>It is necessary, however, that the country programs be approved by the
                        Director of the Foreign Operations Administration as a part of the
                        coordination function, and in order to give this approval, a reasonable
                        amount of the detailed information is required which I believe can be
                        furnished without difficulty from the regular information you assemble for
                        your own purposes in the Department of Defense.</p>
                    <p>It is likewise necessary, when a special question of implementation of some
                        phase of the President’s program arises, to then ask for additional detail
                        in order to determine whether we can reach agreement or whether it is
                        necessary to refer the matter to the <pb n="747" xml:id="pg_747" facs="0773"
                        />President for his supervising decision and control. The necessity for
                        asking for detailed information on 105 and 155 millimeter howitzers in 1953
                        was an example of this kind of situation. As you know, by reason of our
                        detailed requests and follow up, this question was resolved without
                        Presidential intervention.</p>
                    <p>I am further agreeable that as the fiscal year proceeds, if at any point you
                        feel that the Foreign Operations Administration is asking for information
                        that they should not request, or is taking a position on an issue which
                        represents “control” or “supervision” rather than “coordination,” you raise
                        it directly with me, and you and I will endeavor promptly to resolve it.</p>
                    <p>I am confident that the President’s draft Executive Order does correctly
                        state the basic responsibilities and authorities, and that by actual conduct
                        under it we can establish a sound interpretation and carry out a harmonious
                        relationship in the interests of United States objectives.</p>
                    <p>It is my view that the reserve which we are setting up will eliminate the
                        re-programming problem which has caused difficulty in the past.</p>
                    <p>It is also my hope that a method of greater flexibility, through either
                        setting up a “requirements program” on a long range basis and a “hard core
                        procurement program” on a fiscal year basis, would further facilitate
                        effective operations of the President’s program. The current <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> study of the priority methods may help in
                        this respect.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your courteous attention to these matters. I look forward to
                        working with you during the year.</p>

                    <p>There are two very important problems involved: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The first is the takeover of administration. The attached memorandum
                                deals primarily with this and concludes with the points I mentioned
                                to you this morning, namely, that regardless of whether the
                                Executive Branch may persuade the Congress next spring to allow
                                    <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> to continue, this is so
                                uncertain and the planning for an assumption of administrative
                                responsibility is so great that prudence requires us to start making
                                the necessary plans at once.</p>
                            <p>The second is the presentation to the next Congress of the economic
                                and military assistance programs for fiscal year 1956. In recent
                                years during the existence of <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>
                                and <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>, the preparation and
                                presentation of these programs to the Congress, an extremely large
                                and complex mass of legislation, has been coordinated by <gloss
                                    target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>. It was plainly indicated during
                                the hearings this summer that the Congress expects next year’s
                                programs to be presented by State and Defense. Although it will, of
                                course, be necessary (and acceptable to the Congress) to use many of
                                the existing <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> experts as
                                witnesses, this Department will have to be responsible for the
                                presentation of the economic programs and for coordinating the
                                presentation by Defense of the military programs. This also requires
                                early preparation.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>I believe the Secretary agrees that we cannot delay in getting started to
                        make plans, even though we may still hope to avoid the necessity of putting
                        them into effect. However, I believe it is essential that, before going
                        ahead on this basis, understanding to this effect be reached with the
                        President, Mr. Stassen and Secretary Wilson, and Director Hughes. I do not
                        believe that the Secretary or General Smith have yet had an opportunity to
                        deal with this.</p>

                                    exercise the powers conferred upon him under Title III of this
                                    Act through the Secretary of State.” (This refers to the
                                    Technical Assistance Program.)</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Although no provision is contained in the Act for the future
                            administration of the Military Assistance Program, it was repeatedly <pb
                                n="750" xml:id="pg_750" facs="0776"/>indicated by the Congress that
                            it should be administered by the Department of Defense.</p>
                        <p>The Congress also strongly indicated its intention that the presentation
                            of any future request for additional foreign aid should be presented by
                            the appropriate <hi rend="italic">regular</hi> agency of the Government.
                            Experience has shown that the massive preparations required for the
                            formulation and presentation of programs of this size and complexity
                            must be begun within the next few weeks. Estimates for Fiscal Year 1956
                            must be ready for the President’s Budget Message in January.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Discussion</hi></p>
                        <p>It is the view of <gloss target="#t_H1">H</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_SMSA1">S/MSA</gloss> that the legislative provisions and
                            views stated above express the firm decision of the Congress which, in
                            the absence of some international emergency, will be final. Although it
                            is conceivable that vigorous representations by the President to the
                            Eighty-fourth Congress might obtain a continuation of <gloss
                                target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>, it is our view that this would be at
                            the cost of a considerable measure of support for the mutual assistance
                            programs. Furthermore, it will not be possible to know whether such an
                            effort could succeed until sometime after Congress convenes. The
                            preparation of materials needed to develop and present Fiscal Year 1956
                            programs to the Congress, and the orderly dissolution of <gloss
                                target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> and transfer of functions and needed
                            personnel to the Departments of State and Defense, require planning and
                            considerable time. If a decision is postponed until Congress convenes in
                            January, and if it is then determined to be inadvisable or impossible to
                            obtain a continuation of <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>, the
                            Executive Branch would be left in an unprepared position both with
                            respect to the presentation of the Fiscal Year 1956 program to Congress
                            and with respect to administering the programs after June 30, 1955.</p>
                        <p>The personnel problems involved are significant. <gloss target="#t_FOA1"
                                >FOA</gloss> may not be able to carry out its responsibilities
                            effectively this year unless its personnel have some assurance regarding
                            their future. State and Defense should make early plans to employ those
                            skilled officers who may be needed in the future. In addition, absorbing
                            large numbers of <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> personnel will have
                            a substantial effect on the Department’s integration program and must be
                            planned for. Finally, it may be found necessary for the Department to
                            request legislation for additional statutory offices and for the
                            organizational structure needed to administer the program. Planning for
                            any needed legislation should not be delayed.</p>

                            Foreign Economic and Military Assistance Programs</p>
                        <p>The Congress in enacting the Mutual Security Act of 1954 has directed
                            that the Foreign Operations Administration shall cease to exist no later
                            than June 30, 1955. It has directed that the administration of foreign
                            technical assistance be transferred to the Department of State and has
                            indicated its intention that military assistance shall be administered
                            by the Department of Defense. It has also indicated that all requests to
                            the Congress for future foreign economic or military assistance shall be
                            made by the appropriate regular agency of the Government. The pertinent
                            statements are attached.<note n="6" xml:id="d208fn6">Not
                            printed.</note></p>
                        <p>As you know, it is my belief—which I stated to the Congressional
                            Committees—that the Foreign Operations Administration is functioning
                            effectively and should continue. However, in view of the carefully
                            considered and determined action of the Congress there seems little
                            likelihood that the 84th Congress can be persuaded to reverse the
                            83rd.</p>
                        <p>In any event, the magnitude of the task of transferring the economic and
                            military functions now administered by <gloss target="#t_FOA1"
                                >FOA</gloss> and of preparing the extensive material necessary for
                            the presentation of <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752" facs="0778"/>next year’s
                            economic and military aid programs is so great and so urgent that
                            planning for it cannot be safely deferred until a determination can be
                            made as to the attitude of the 84th Congress. I believe it is necessary
                            that planning for the transfer and for next year’s programs go forward
                            at once—if only on a tentative basis and subject to a possible halt. It
                            is also most important that the skilled and loyal employees of <gloss
                                target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> be given some indication of their
                            future and that early arrangements be made to transfer and retain those
                            whose services will be needed.</p>
                        <p>Such planning obviously is of major concern to the Foreign Operations
                            Administrator, the Department of Defense, and the Department of State,
                            and of interest to the Bureau of the Budget and a number of other
                            agencies. In order to get the necessary planning under way at once, I
                            suggest that you authorize Secretary Wilson, Mr. Stassen, and me (or our
                            representatives) to begin work at once on the necessary plans,
                            coordinating with Mr. Hughes and other interested agencies as
                            necessary.</p>

                    <p>Secretary Humphrey feels, and I agree, that it is essential for Director of
                        the Budget Hughes to participate, and that little progress would be made in
                        his absence. We do not think we should discuss this with the Deputy
                        Director. Mr. Hughes will return on October 5, and I suggest that
                        immediately thereafter you or Mr. Hoover ask <pb n="753" xml:id="pg_753"
                            facs="0779"/>him to call a meeting on his own initiative of Secretary
                        Humphrey, Secretary Wilson, and yourself or Mr. Hoover, together with Mr.
                        Stassen, in order to discuss the problems presented by the possibility that,
                        regardless of any effort to persuade the 84th Congress to the contrary,
                            <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> may be discontinued. I think it is
                        better to initiate the action this way than for you to go to the President
                        about it, as organizational planning of this kind is one of the functions of
                        the Budget Bureau. Secretary Humphrey is at present acting as a
                        “non-partisan” chairman or arbitrator to iron out the dispute between the
                        Defense Department and <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> regarding the
                        extent of coordination. He said that a solution written by him could not
                        remain effective because of the different interpretations of coordination,
                        and he would prefer this matter of organizational planning to be done by
                        other than those who participated in the unsuccessful exercise.</p>

                            State in which he noted that this report “was informally coordinated
                            with this Department through <gloss target="#t_SMSA1">S/MSA</gloss> at
                            the time of first draft” but that the pressure of a “rigid deadline” set
                            by the Bureau of the Budget had precluded careful review and comment by
                            the Department of State. For this reason, he continued, “I have reserved
                            this Department’s position with <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> and
                            any serious objections arising from the more thorough review of the
                            current paper will be taken into account.” He concluded with the
                            assurance that he was “ready to receive and to see that careful
                            consideration is given to any comment suggesting major changes in the

                    <p>This memorandum is designed to provide the assumptions, guidelines and other
                        instructions required for the preparation, and submission to the Bureau of
                        the Budget, of the initial <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 Mutual
                        Security Program. It is intended to give the minimum guidance necessary for
                        the orderly development by all agencies concerned of an integrated and
                        coherent presentation which is responsive to the totality of U.S. foreign
                        aid requirements and which, in all of its <pb n="754" xml:id="pg_754"
                            facs="0780"/>component parts, reflects consistent assumptions and a full
                        regard for the inter-acting effects of the various political, economic and
                        military factors which are involved. The memorandum does hot, however, deal
                        with the details to be covered in, and format of, each type of program
                        submission. The latter problem has already, to the extent that it
                        necessitates central instructions, been disposed of informally by agreement
                        among all those concerned. Any further questions on this subject should be
                        addressed to Mr. Robert Black of <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>, Room

                                otherwise stated, all assumptions which are set forth in this
                                memorandum are to be considered by all programming offices affected
                                as established premises upon which their programs are to be
                                developed. However, in recognition of (1) the fluidity of the
                                present world situation and (2) the desirability of securing
                                original, constructive and imaginative approaches to the fundamental
                                problems with which the foreign aid program is intended to deal,
                                each programming office is invited to submit any alternative
                                programs which are based on alternative assumptions whenever it
                                feels (i) that such an alternative approach might provide a better
                                solution to problems falling within its cognizance than solutions
                                which are predicated on the assumptions contained in this
                                memorandum, or (ii) that the assumptions themselves are untenable or
                                unwise.</item>

                                which are provided in the case of certain programs have a status and
                                force entirely different from that of the other assumptions set out
                                in this memorandum. The “planning figure” for any specific program
                                does not represent a ceiling within which such program must be
                                prepared, but rather a general reference point for programmers with
                                respect to the general order of magnitude which, in the absence of a
                                convincing contrary demonstration, might be indicated by fiscal
                                considerations. Programmers will be at liberty, if they feel that
                                the requirements so dictate, to depart from any such figure, either
                                upwards or downwards, by any margin which they consider desirable,
                                but they should understand that the further a given program
                                submission deviates from its planning figure the greater the
                                justification which will be required therefor. In the case of many
                                programs, no “planning figure” is given because, due to major
                                uncertainties with respect to the nature of the programs required,
                                there appears to be no logical method of deriving such a figure at
                                this time except through the programming process itself.</item>

                                    for contingencies can, in the discretion of any programming
                                    office, be submitted as a special item, together with as
                                    complete a rationale and justification therefor as possible. The
                                    Bureau’s guidance is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>“The current uncertainties existing in the foreign area
                                            seem to call for some allowance in the <gloss
                                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 program for items
                                            contingent in nature. However, since it rarely happens
                                            that all the contingencies materialize, an allowance for
                                            each contingency in each geographic area would pyramid
                                            the amounts. In view of the flexibility contained in the
                                            President’s transfer authority and the surplus
                                            agricultural programs, the individual items should not
                                            include allowances for contingencies which should be
                                            provided for instead on an overall basis. This approach
                                            to contingencies should provide a more meaningful basis
                                            on which to determine minimum feasible amounts.”</p>

                                    be justified as such and not on the basis of military or
                                    economic necessities. Guidance from the Bureau of the Budget on
                                    this point is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>“Programs have been submitted and justified in the past
                                            on the basis that they were required because of economic
                                            considerations, but upon examination it became clear the
                                            real basis was of a political nature or other special
                                            considerations. Where the latter considerations furnish
                                            the primary basis for aid, they should be clearly
                                            presented in the initial submission.”</p>

                            respect to specific forms of assistance</hi></p>
                    <p>For purposes of simplicity it has been assumed in this memorandum that the
                        presentation of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 Mutual Security
                        Program to the Budget Bureau and to the Congress would classify all
                        assistance proposed in substantially the same six categories that <pb
                            n="761" xml:id="pg_761" facs="0787"/>were established in the Mutual
                        Security Act of 1954 as finally passed. These categories, all but one of
                        which is discussed and defined below, are the following: (A) military
                        assistance; (B) direct forces support; (C) defense support; (D) development
                        assistance; (E) technical cooperation; and (F) other programs, including
                        those multilateral programs which are not included in other classifications.
                        Program submissions should generally follow and recognize these
                        categories.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing assumption and instruction require a certain amount of
                        explanation and qualification. The most important thing at this time is not,
                        of course, the classification of assistance in particular categories, but
                        rather the development for each country and area of a program which, when
                        all of its elements are considered together, represents a fully integrated
                        approach to the problem of such country or area and constitutes the best use
                        of total resources available for that purpose. At the same time, it is
                        highly desirable, for purposes of internal analysis, for purposes of
                        comparison with prior years’ programs, and for purposes of the Budget Bureau
                        and Congressional presentations, to separate out, wherever this is
                        practicable, (and the case is rare where this is not true), the major types
                        of aid components of the total program. The major aid components which are
                        referred to above and further defined below are generally distinguishable
                        from one another either by the physical nature of the assistance provided
                        (military end-items, for example) and/or by the purposes which the aid is
                        intended to accomplish. However, since the problems of a country or area
                        cannot be neatly compartmentalized, the definitions of the major types of
                        aid cannot always be precise, these definitions sometimes overlap, and
                        frequently we have a choice as to the way in which particular aid should be
                        classified. These factors sometimes present programmers in the non-military
                        area with irritating dilemmas, and the temptation is great to ignore the
                        issue and to submit country programs that are not separated into components
                        or are separated in a routine and meaningless fashion. Unfortunately, the
                        task of Congressional presentation is such that those who determine its
                        final form must have before them raw material from programming offices which
                        is susceptible, with the help of the latter, of being grouped in categories
                        and of being combined in a variety of alternative forms.</p>
                    <p>One special footnote about “defense support” and “development assistance” is
                        necessary. In countries where the United States is furnishing military
                        assistance (except Latin America), all non-military assistance except direct
                        forces support and technical cooperation will be classified as “defense
                        support” even though such assistance includes aid for purposes of economic
                        development, relief or budgetary support. In all countries where the U.S. is
                        not furnishing <pb n="762" xml:id="pg_762" facs="0788"/>military assistance
                        and in Latin America, all non-military aid except for technical cooperation
                        will be classified as “development assistance”. We will not have both a
                        “defense support” program and a “development assistance” program in the same
                        country, and a decision to have the former in lieu of the latter is merely
                        the automatic consequence of the existence of a military aid program in the
                        country, is not an indication of a distinction in program content, and is
                        not intended to preclude the inclusion of assistance primarily designed to
                        further economic development of a kind identical with that which may be
                        included under “development assistance” in a country where no military aid
                        program is in operation.</p>
                    <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Military Assistance</hi></p>
                    <p>Programs within this classification are designed to provide the military
                        equipment and training which are required by certain friendly countries in
                        order to develop or maintain specific military, para-military or police
                        units at a given level of effectiveness. The policy reason for undertaking
                        any such program derives in each instance from the existence of two facts:
                        (1) the importance of the units involved to the defense of the United States
                        or to the defense, or to the protection against internal subversion, of an
                        area which is important to the security interest of the United States and
                        (2) the inability of the recipient country to create or to support such
                        units adequately without the equipment and training provided. Military
                        assistance programs almost invariably have an exclusively military or
                        directly related security purpose, even though it is lack of economic
                        strength on the part of the recipient country which makes the extension of
                        such assistance necessary.</p>
                    <p>This classification also includes, but is not limited to, the following
                        programs which, although not falling strictly within the definition above,
                        are closely akin to, and have customarily been treated in conjunction with,
                        military end-item and training programs, the provision of machine tools and
                        other production equipment required for the production of increased military
                        equipment abroad (facilities assistance); contributions to certain

                        to (a) each of the special categories of assistance referred to in the

                    <p>The reason behind this program is the fact that the recipient country, even

                        assistance, is unable to develop and maintain the size and kind of forces

                        attainment of military objectives rather than the extension of any economic
                        benefits which may also accrue to the recipient nation. However, where a
                        defense support program is justified in a country under this policy
                        definition, the program will also include, where this can be supported, such
                        other assistance for that country as U.S. interests dictate should be
                        furnished to promote economic development or to maintain economic or
                        political stability.</p>
                    <p>Defense support differs from direct forces support in the following respect:
                        although both forms of assistance are designed to make possible the creation
                        or maintenance of a certain level of military forces, direct forces support
                        does so by providing, or paying for, goods or services that physically
                        (although sometimes in a different form) reach or benefit the forces
                        involved, whereas defense support contributes to this objective more
                        indirectly through providing resources which either (a) enable the recipient
                        country to maintain a level of defense expenditures or undertake defense
                        activities that would otherwise not be possible or (b) increase the
                        recipient’s capacity to do so in the future. The one form of assistance can
                        be traced directly to a soldier who actually uses it or is served by it; the
                        other form has its specific military impact as a country’s economy is
                        rendered capable of sustaining the desired enlargement of its defense
                        burden.</p>
                    <p>Consideration will be given in the case of every defense support program to
                        the extent to which the assistance involved could be supplied on a loan
                        basis without serious detriment to the attainment of U.S. program
                        objectives. Each programming office should be prepared to demonstrate why
                        any segment of its proposed program cannot be provided on terms of repayment
                        (See IV–B below).</p>
                    <p>For the treatment of defense support programs in relation to regional
                        economic organizations and activities, see the discussion of this subject as
                        it applies to development assistance in D–4 below.</p>
                    <p>D. <hi rend="italic">Development Assistance</hi></p>
                    <p>This term describes assistance given primarily to promote economic
                        development or otherwise to create or maintain economic or political
                        stability. In most nations for which it is proposed, development assistance
                        will supplement programs of technical cooperation by providing supplies,
                        commodities or funds. Usually this type of assistance is required to make
                        possible, or to accelerate, projects or activities which basic United States
                        interest requires to be undertaken and which, in the absence of such
                        additional assistance, would not be undertaken or, if undertaken, would not
                        be carried out at the rate required by United States foreign policy. Mutual

                        certain <pb n="766" xml:id="pg_766" facs="0792"/>European or other developed
                        countries) where United States national security requirements for such
                        growth cannot be met by local and foreign private capital or from financing
                        from the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, Ex-Im Bank or similar
                        sources. Development assistance differs from defense support in that the
                        former is immediately directed toward goals which are not primarily military
                        in character, whereas the latter has as its first aim, and controlling
                        justification, the attainment of military objectives.</p>

                                submitted as part of a balanced country program. Only those programs

                        largely of, advice, teaching, training and the exchange of information, and

                        that which is required for effective teaching and demonstration purposes.
                        Moreover, except for these last mentioned purposes, they do not supply the
                        capital which may often, if not always, be indispensable to the conversion
                        of the knowledge, skills, techniques and experience which are thus provided

                        be, issued with respect to the meaning and content of the term “technical
                        cooperation” under the Mutual Security Act of 1954 should be used as a guide
                        in determining the general scope of activities and the forms of aid which

                        policies established by the National Security Council and the President.</p>
                    <p>Two steps are proposed: (1) modification of the semi-annual <gloss

                        Program to provide understandable summaries of the progress toward the

                        our aid; and (2) establishment of a high-level interdepartmental committee
                        (State, Defense, <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>; with Treasury, <gloss
                            target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> and the Budget Bureau as observers) to
                        review the semi-annual Status Report and to flag important issues to the

                    <p>There are two splits in the paper. <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>
                        suggests that <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> should act as chairman of
                        the interdepartmental committee in view of Governor Stassen’s role as
                        coordinator under the statute. The feeling <pb n="780" xml:id="pg_780"
                            facs="0806"/>of the other members of the Planning Board is that State
                        should chair the committee. The second split is important. It involves the
                        question of whether the committee can concern itself with priorities between
                        international and national programs, the allocation of end-items from
                        current production, and the development of the mobilization base and levels
                        of production at home and abroad. Since these are the root factors which
                        really determine the rate of buildup abroad, it is important that they be
                        included in the frame of reference of the committee if it is to discharge
                        its responsibility. Defense objects on grounds that the question of
                        allocation and levels of production is strictly a Defense Department
                        matter.</p>

                    <p>After briefing the Council on the background of the problem and describing
                        briefly the proposed review mechanism, Mr. Cutler summarized or read the key
                        paragraphs in the Planning Board’s report.<note n="5" xml:id="d213fn5">The
                            “Planning Board report” under reference was <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 5434 of Sept. 28, 1954.</note> He then turned back and
                        identified and explained the several splits in point of view, noting that
                        Governor Stassen had already withdrawn the <gloss target="#t_FOA1"
                            >FOA</gloss> position that the chairmanship of the proposed special
                        committee should go to <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of Mr. Cutler’s opening remarks, Secretary Humphrey
                        inquired whether the proposed special committee at the Assistant Secretary
                        level was expected to present the Council with recommendations and
                        decisions, or merely to submit an informational report. Mr. Cutler explained
                        that the special committee was merely to present a photograph of the
                        existing situation at the time with regard to foreign military assistance
                        programs. It would be the function of the Planning Board to make
                        recommendations to the Council on the basis of the special committee’s
                        report. Mr. Cutler also emphasized that the special committee would have no
                        duties involving the supervision of the day-to-day operations with respect
                        to the various military assistance programs, which operations would be
                        conducted, as in the past, by the Department of Defense.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Humphrey said that in this case he could not understand why the
                        Department of State, <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>, and <gloss
                            target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> contended that the special committee should
                        study allocations, priorities and requirements as between foreign programs
                        and domestic military programs. The special committee should confine itself
                        strictly to the field of foreign military assistance programs.</p>
                    <p>Acting Secretary Talbott said that this was emphatically the view of the
                        Department of Defense. Admiral Radford added that the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        had no particular objection to the arrangements proposed in the present
                        report, but it was his own personal view that if the National Security
                        Council thought it desirable to have a semi-annual review of all of our
                        military assistance programs, <pb n="782" xml:id="pg_782" facs="0808"/>the
                        Defense Department was in the best position to present such a review. After
                        all, continued Admiral Radford, the Defense Department administered these
                        foreign assistance programs as nearly as possible in accordance with the
                        broad guidance of National Security Council policies. The difficulties which
                        had arisen were not the result of ineffective administration by the Defense
                        Department, but were rather a reflection of the fact that our national
                        security policies don’t always work out as we wished them to. For all these
                        reasons Admiral Radford personally doubted the value of the proposed new
                        mechanism. There were just too many details for such a special committee to
                        get involved with.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cutler replied that it would not be the purpose of the proposed special
                        committee to get into the details of administering the foreign military
                        assistance programs. If it were, he would agree with Admiral Radford’s
                        views. Mr. Cutler again proceeded to explain the function of the special
                        committee as conceived by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning
                        Board.</p>
                    <p>Governor Stassen insisted that the issues which were implicit in a review of
                        foreign military assistance comprised the whole range of United States
                        security policies—foreign and domestic aspects as well as military aspects.
                        Hence, the broad membership of the proposed high-level committee would make
                        a valuable contribution. After all, he continued, this problem raised issues
                        not only between various executive departments, but also within individual
                        departments. Moreover, there were occasions when there was a direct conflict
                        between the requirements for the U.S. military establishment and the
                        requirements for assistance to friendly foreign nations. There must be a
                        forum in which such a conflict could be explored in order to provide the
                        President with the basis for a solution.</p>
                    <p>Both Secretary Humphrey and Admiral Radford indicated their firm belief that
                        there would be no great difficulty in getting such issues before the
                        President for his decision. Secretary Humphrey added that this task should
                        not be assigned to any special committee, but should instead be decided by
                        the National Security Council itself. Any other solution was tantamount to
                        interfering with the prerogatives and responsibilities of the Department of
                        Defense.</p>
                    <p>Governor Stassen cited the recent case of the alleged shortage of 105 mm.
                        Howitzers, to illustrate the need for a special committee. Acting Secretary
                        Talbott, however, insisted that there was no need to create any special
                        committee in order to solve the problem cited by Governor Stassen. Secretary
                        Humphrey reiterated his firm conviction that if it were created, the new
                        special committee must not in any circumstances be permitted to interfere
                        with the responsibilities of the Department of Defense for the day-to-day
                        implementation <pb n="783" xml:id="pg_783" facs="0809"/>of the foreign
                        military assistance programs. Any balancing of foreign and domestic
                        requirements for military end items and the like should only be exercised by
                        the National Security Council. It was a waste of time to assign this
                        function to any special committee. If the Defense Department proved
                        incompetent in executing its responsibilities, the thing to do was to get a
                        new team to run the Defense Department efficiently.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Flemming said he would like to remind the Council of the basic objective
                        behind the new proposal. This was, in effect, to get a significant staff job
                        accomplished in order to assist the Planning Board and the National Security
                        Council to carry out their responsibilities. While he had not personally
                        discussed this paper with anyone, Dr. Flemming said he very much doubted the
                        need for any special committee as a means of getting a staff job done. If
                        the Planning Board was unable to do this job with its own resources, it
                        might be well to seek the assistance of some individual, such as Mr. Robert
                        Sprague, to look into the problem. Mr. Cutler replied that of course the
                        Planning Board could call individually on such experts as Mr. Hensel in
                        Defense, Mr. Nolting in State, and Mr. Ohly in <gloss target="#t_FOA1"
                            >FOA</gloss>, in order to review foreign military assistance and prepare
                        recommendations for the Council. He had believed, however, that rather than
                        resorting to the assistance of individuals, these experts should be formed
                        into a committee as likely to provide a more orderly, effective, and
                        dignified procedure.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Humphrey said that he had no objection to the creation of a special
                        committee to make a report of the existing situation, as long as this
                        committee did not interfere with the functions of the Defense Department.
                        Dr. Flemming, however, counseled putting the responsibility directly on the
                        Planning Board, with the expectation that the Planning Board would decide
                        how best to accomplish the task.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cutler then called attention to the possibility noted in paragraph 3,
                        that an “Interdepartmental Mutual Security Committee” might be set up. He
                        asked the Director of the Budget if such a committee was actually going to
                        be created. Mr. Hughes replied in the negative, and went on to state his
                        agreement with the general position taken by Dr. Flemming. Secretary Hoover
                        said that the State Department felt that it was absolutely essential, from
                        the point of view of our foreign policy, to have a semi-annual review of all
                        the commitments made by the United States to provide military assistance to
                        friendly powers. It was also essential to note the changes which occurred
                        from time to time in these commitments. Accordingly, the Department of State
                        was convinced of the great need for the creation of such a special committee
                        as was called for by the present report. On the other hand, said Secretary
                        Hoover, the State <pb n="784" xml:id="pg_784" facs="0810"/>Department was
                        not contemplating that the committee would in any way interfere with the
                        normal duties of the Department of Defense.</p>
                    <p>As a result of this discussion the Council agreed to strike out the last
                        three sentences in paragraph 3 of the report, after which Mr. Cutler pointed
                        out that the remaining big issue was whether the special committee, in
                        making its report, should confine its scrutiny strictly to the programs for
                        foreign military assistance or whether, in so doing, the committee should
                        also have in mind the over-all relationship between domestic military
                        requirements and foreign military requirements. State, <gloss
                            target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>
                        favored the over-all look by the special committee; the other agencies and
                        departments thought that the special committee should confine itself to a
                        scrutiny of the foreign field alone.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Flemming commented that if you were going to have such a special
                        committee (which he still believed to be unnecessary), the special committee
                        should most certainly take the over-all look, though this did not mean that
                        it should have any voice in the day-to-day operations of the Defense
                        Department, as Secretary Humphrey and Admiral Radford seemed to fear.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cutler then stated his opinion that the Council discussion revealed a
                        clear split of views as between the narrow and the broad scope for the
                        special committee’s review. After summing up the two different points of
                        view, Mr. Cutler suggested two possible solutions. One was to put this split
                        to the President with a request that he make the decision, which proposal,
                        said Mr. Cutler, put a heavy burden on the President. Or, alternatively, the
                        Council might agree to delete all references in the report to the special
                        committee, with the clear and explicit understanding that the Planning Board
                        was authorized to create some such committee to assist it in identifying and
                        flagging issues respecting foreign military assistance programs, on the
                        basis of which the Planning Board could prepare recommendations for Council
                        consideration.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Humphrey read paragraph 4–a, which described the proposed functions
                        of the special committee, and said that he was at a loss to understand how
                        anybody could interpret this paragraph as anything but authority for the
                        special committee to supervise the routine operations of the Defense
                        Department in implementing foreign military assistance programs. Mr. Cutler
                        again explained that this was certainly not the intention of the Planning
                        Board, while Dr. Flemming added that if Secretary Humphrey’s interpretation
                        of paragraph 4 was correct, he was just as opposed to it as Secretary
                        Humphrey himself. He said he agreed, however, to accept the second of Mr.
                        Cutler’s proposed compromises.</p>
                    <pb n="785" xml:id="pg_785" facs="0811"/>
                    <p>Acting Secretary Talbott said that he would like to comment briefly on the
                        whole range of special consultants and civilian committees as they had been
                        operating in the Defense Department. He had in mind in particular Mr. Robert
                        Sprague’s report on continental defense.<note n="6" xml:id="d213fn6">For
                            documentation on continental defense, see <ref target="frus1952-54v02p1"
                                >volume <hi rend="smallcaps">ii</hi></ref>.</note> While admittedly
                        Mr. Sprague’s conclusions had been very effectively presented, his report
                        had actually contained absolutely nothing new and nothing of which the
                        Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were not already acutely
                        aware. Moreover, Mr. Sprague’s report had involved a “fabulous” waste of man
                        hours in the Defense Department, in view of the fact that it made no
                        contribution whatsoever. In short, the Joint Chiefs themselves were a much
                        more effective group than any of these civilian committees or consultants.
                        Agreeing with Secretary Talbott, Admiral Radford pointed out that of course
                        the Joint Chiefs of Staff handled problems like these every day.</p>
                    <p>Governor Stassen commented that the President seemed to have a quite
                        different view of the effectiveness of Mr. Sprague’s study of the
                        continental defense problem, and that the President believed that the
                        Sprague report had actually brought up a number of new needs in the area of
                        continental defense. Furthermore, said Governor Stassen, he did not feel
                        that any single executive department had a field of activity and
                        responsibility that was exclusively its own business. The President was
                        obliged to decide conflicts between departments and agencies, and it was the
                        duty of the National Security Council to provide means of assisting him in
                        reaching such decisions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cutler confined himself to observing that if the President of the United
                        States desired to make use of civilian consultants he was very likely to
                        request their services, despite the views of the National Security Council.
                        He again suggested his compromise solution of removing the special committee
                        and authorizing the Planning Board to make use of a committee of its own
                        choosing to assist it in arriving at recommendations.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Hoover indicated that this compromise was satisfactory from the
                        point of view of satisfying the State Department’s basic need for a
                        semi-annual review of the whole foreign military assistance picture which
                        would tie in the foreign policy, the military, and the economic aspects of
                        the problem.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the discussion Admiral Radford again expressed, as he
                        had in the past, his great concern over the ramifications of our military
                        assistance programs. They were too loaded and too big already, and yet we
                        still continued to take on additional programs without any clear idea of
                        where we were going.</p>

                                in Paris.” A covering memorandum from Roderic O’Connor to Nolting,
                                dated Oct. 25, 1954, reads: “Fritz—Stassen gave this to the
                                Secretary in Paris. Will you see that proper people see it,
                                particularly Mr. Hoover.” Secretary Dulles and Stassen were at Paris
                                to attend a one-day session of the North Atlantic Council, Oct. 23,
                                1954.</p><p>Secretary Dulles and Stassen held a number of
                                conversations both at Washington and in Europe during this time. On
                                Oct. 18, at Stassen’s initiative, the two men had discussed the
                                ultimate disposition of the Foreign Operations Administration. A
                                memorandum of their conversation reads in part as follows: “The
                                Secretary stated that this was an exceedingly complex matter. The
                                only firm feeling which he had was that he would prefer not to have
                                    <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> become a part of the State
                                Department. Nevertheless, if it was decided that such should be the
                                policy, he would naturally follow out whatever agreement might be
                                made. Although it was agreed that this matter should receive early
                                consideration as soon as he and Governor Stassen returned from
                                Europe, no commitments as to procedure or plans were made by the
                                Secretary.” (Memorandum of conversation, by Under Secretary Hoover,
                                Oct. 18, 1954, 103 <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>/10–1854)
                                Stassen and Dulles conducted a wide-ranging discussion at the
                                American Embassy in Paris on Oct. 22 during the course of which,
                                presumably, Stassen handed Dulles this memorandum. However, the
                                objectives and fate of the Foreign Operations Administration were
                                not discussed at this meeting. (Memorandum of conversation, by

                        and scattered through a number of Departments. An entity somewhere in the
                        government charged with the operational responsibility of fitting together
                        comprehensive U.S. programs with reference to countries and regions is
                        essential to success in implementing U.S. foreign policy. The same entity
                        must have in its <pb n="791" xml:id="pg_791" facs="0817"/>direct
                        administration the personnel required to bring about prompt execution of

                        difficult to successfully conduct if a combined operating entity had not
                        existed somewhere in the government or if that entity did not have direct
                        jurisdiction over personnel with the skills and experience required.</p>

                        desirable because it is functioning successfully. The Secretary of State’s
                        emphasis upon the State Department as a policy organization is beginning to
                        show significant results from intelligent policy formation, and the
                        operations entity is responsive and effective in carrying out policy without
                        involving State in operational details.</p>
                    <p>Congressional opposition might be difficult to overcome, but the record of
                        accumulating success of the present method, if presented with a strong
                        recommendation of the President and the Secretary of State, would presumably
                        be accepted by the Congressional leaders of both parties.</p>
                    <p>D. The second alternative would be the establishment within the Department of
                        Defense of a Department of Mutual Security. This is considered as second in
                        desirability because the Department of Defense is essentially an operational
                        department and additional operational activities would fit readily.
                        Furthermore, the inter-relationships of the military, police, economic,
                        East-West trade, and development factors are extensive and could be better
                        resolved in the Department of Defense than elsewhere. The necessary
                        appropriations could be obtained easier in this form. A charge of
                        “militarism” in the program and a danger of excess orientation toward
                        military objectives as distinguished from national foreign policy objectives
                        would be minus factors. Both could be overcome by the actual conduct of the
                        program.</p>
                    <p>E. The third alternative would be the establishment of an entity such as a
                        Foreign Operations Administration in the State Department. This would have
                        the advantage of closer control by the Secretary of State and would be
                        conducive to broader understanding of the fact that the program was designed
                        to implement the foreign policy of the United States. Disadvantages would be
                        increased difficulty <pb n="792" xml:id="pg_792" facs="0818"/>in obtaining
                        necessary appropriations, involvement of State in operational details, and
                        clouding of the distinct policy formation role of State for the entire
                        government.</p>
                    <p>F. The fourth alternative would be the establishment of an entity in
                        Treasury. This would have the advantage of bringing the creditor role of the
                        U.S. into better focus and would emphasize the fact that the total program
                        is in the U.S. national interest. It would result in increased understanding
                        in Treasury of the nature of the program and its accomplishments. It would
                        involve a rather complete shift to loans rather than grants, including loans
                        for military equipment. The latter would assist in holding down the arms
                        requests of the less developed countries. This alternative would be closer
                        to the U.K. system with the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s broad
                            responsibilities.<note n="3" xml:id="d215fn3">The only immediate

                    <p>On November 6, 1954, President Eisenhower issued Executive Order 10575 which
                        further defined the administration of foreign aid functions. In his
                        Executive Order the President more precisely divided and defined
                        responsibility for the foreign aid program between the Foreign Operations
                        Administration and the Departments of State, Defense, and Commerce. The
                        Executive Order also stipulated that the chiefs of United States diplomatic
                        missions abroad would exercise, as direct representatives of the President,
                        plenary coordinating powers over all aspects of United States policy
                        relating to the respective countries to which they were accredited.
                        Furthermore, the chiefs of mission were granted plenary adjudicatory powers
                        in all unresolved policy matters “unless a representative of a United States
                        agency requests that the issue be referred to the Secretary of State and the
                        United States agencies concerned for decision.” For text of Executive Order

                    <p>We talked about the future organization of economic work. I said I thought
                        that Mr. Dodge would recommend a sort of economic <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                        view to securing coordination. Mr. Stassen said he was not familiar with
                        this possible recommendation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stassen then asked my own views with reference to the future of <gloss

                        thinking was running along the following lines: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>

                                to deal with (a) defense support programs where we gave budgetary
                                aid to enable countries to maintain the size and character of
                                military establishments we wanted and which they could not afford to
                                do unaided, and (b) offshore procurement, where of course there
                                would need to be close cooperation with the Defense
                                Department.</item>

                            <item>I said that I thought that other matters on economic aid should be
                                handled by a new investment corporation to be formed, presumably on
                                a universal basis, although possibly there might be more than one on
                                a regional basis with substantial capital of say two or three
                                billion dollars. They would make loans which in some cases might for
                                political reasons be “soft” loans in local currency, but the
                                organization would also make development loans in capital
                                improvements in South America, the Far East and Middle East and take
                                over that type of work now being done by the EX-IM Bank so that that
                                bank would limit itself primarily to the financing of United States
                                exports and imports. I said I thought that this institution might
                                very well be primarily under the guidance of the Treasury Department
                                with representation of State, Commerce, etc., on the assumption that
                                Treasury would recognize it as an instrument of national
                                policy.</item>

                    <p>I said that I felt that Stassen had to come up with some new plan for

                    <p>There are now available for your consideration, prior to a firm
                        recommendation from Mr. Stassen to the Bureau of the Budget, estimates of
                        requirements for the next fiscal year under the Mutual Security Program.
                        These fall into two parts; the military end-item and training requirements
                        and the non-military requirements. The latter are arranged under the
                        categories of direct forces support, defense support, development
                        assistance, technical cooperation, and multilaterial programs.</p>
                    <p>Representatives of the geographic bureaus and of my office have participated
                        in the screening of submissions from the field in order to arrive at these
                        recommendations to you. I have also had the opportunity to review at length
                        with Governor Stassen and his assistants the non-military submissions, and
                        as a result we have in most instances arrived at an agreed figure, ad
                        referendum to you. In a few instances, the Assistant Secretaries concerned
                        recommend upward adjustments in the figures discussed with Governor Stassen.
                        I will bring their recommendations to your attention this afternoon.</p>
                    <p>It should be noted that, in arriving at the estimates which will be discussed
                        with you today, it was assumed that (a) the organizational arrangements
                        within the U.S. Government for carrying out aid programs would remain as at
                        present, and (b) the Congressional limitation on the continuation of
                        development assistance programs beyond June 30, 1955 was not taken into
                        account.</p>
                    <p>I should like in this memorandum to comment on three aspects of the Mutual
                        Security Program: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>

                            <label>2.</label>

                                programs.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The modalities of furnishing U.S. assistance.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>The total amounts recommended for the Mutual Security Program in fiscal year
                        1956 is $3,226 billion. This is divided into $700 million for military
                        assistance and $2,526 billion for economic programs ($200 million of the
                        latter to be reimbursed to Defense for military funds used for economic
                        purposes this year). After careful consideration, the Defense Department has
                        decided that it does not <pb n="795" xml:id="pg_795" facs="0821"/>need more
                        than $700 million of now appropriations to enable it to continue the
                        military assistance program at approximately the expenditure level of recent
                        years, which in fiscal 1956 is estimated at $3.3 billion. I am satisfied
                        that approximately $3.3 billion worth of equipment can be delivered in
                        fiscal year 1956 under the Defense proposal. The question therefore hinges
                        on whether or not, in your judgment, a delivery rate higher than $3.3
                        billion is necessary next fiscal year, in the light of the projected world
                        situation, including the rearmament of Germany and the additional tensions
                        this may generate.</p>
                    <p>On the economic side, the proposed figure of $2.526 billion compares with
                        $1.898 billion requested of the Congress for these purposes last year. The
                        increase is the result of the inclusion of a world-wide contingency fund of
                        $150 million to meet unforeseen emergencies, the proposal to contribute $250
                        million to a regional economic organization in the Far East, and the $200
                        million for reimbursement to Defense. The levels of other programs,
                        generally speaking, are approximately the same as this fiscal year.</p>
                    <p>One of the factors which is very important in considering these matters is
                        whether or not, as a matter of policy, the United States should undertake to
                        build up forces in friendly countries beyond the economic capacity of those
                        countries to support such forces. Examples are Turkey, where this has

                        consideration, Pakistan, Iran, Thailand, and the Philippines. The
                        submissions before you, generally speaking, do not envisage force levels
                        beyond the economic capacity of the countries except in those cases (Korea,
                        Formosa, Turkey, and Pakistan) where commitments have already been made.
                        Indo-China, of course, is an exception.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the modalities of furnishing United States assistance, and with
                        specific reference to your memorandum of conversation with Mr. Stassen of
                        November 19,<note n="1" xml:id="d218fn1"><ref target="#d217"><hi
                                    rend="italic">Supra</hi></ref>.</note> these submissions do not
                        envisage the creation of a U.S. “soft loan corporation”. They do, however,
                        as noted above, anticipate the contribution by the U.S. of $250 million to
                        an Asian economic organization, one of whose functions would be to lend on
                        easy credit terms for development projects in the area. Furthermore, it is
                        roughly estimated that $350–$400 million of the non-military funds can and
                        should be extended in the form of loan assistance, following the pattern
                        established this year under the $200 million Congressional requirement. As
                        you know, I have personally held the view for over a year that the
                        establishment of a liberal-term lending institution, with sufficient
                        capitalization, would supply the missing ingredient in a number of our aid
                            <pb n="796" xml:id="pg_796" facs="0822"/>programs—namely, continuity and
                        a sense on the part of the recipient of his ability to carry through to
                        completion fundamental development projects. I think this sense of
                        continuity cannot be achieved under our system of annual authorizations and
                        appropriations. However, it is clear that the capitalization of such a
                        lending institution in fiscal year 1956 would result in a net increase in
                        the amount contained in the present submissions—perhaps $1.5 billion
                        increase. By the same token, it would doubtless result in a reduced
                        requirement for fiscal year 1957. You may wish to discuss this concept
                        further with Mr. Stassen this afternoon.<note n="2" xml:id="d218fn2"

                        culminated in a meeting between Secretary Dulles and Stassen at the
                        Department of State on November 30, at which time agreement was reached on
                            <gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss> Non-Military Programs, and at the

                    <p>Pursuant to your request, I recommend the following general outline of
                        organizational structure for the Mutual Security Programs for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ’56. I should like to stress again the
                        urgency of a decision in this matter, for reasons both of continuity of
                        operations in the Mutual Security field and adequacy of presentation to the
                        Congress early next spring. I believe that the decision on this question is
                        important enough, and of sufficient interest to the Congress, to warrant its
                        inclusion in either the State of the Union Message or the President’s Budget
                        Message in January.</p>

                            Support Programs (common-use items and, in some cases, direct payment of
                            military expenses) should be administered by the Department of Defense,
                            subject to policy guidance and control by the Secretary of State.</item>

                            Administration except Development Assistance should be transferred to
                            the Department of State. This proposal would include the administration
                            of the Battle Act, the Escapee Program, the investment promotional work
                            of <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>, and other miscellaneous
                            activities (some of which might be dropped). This is recommended only if
                            we are prepared to undertake the necessary reorganization required
                            within the State Department to carry out these functions.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>To carry forward the necessary Development Assistance Programs, a
                            world-wide lending institution should be created, perhaps on a corporate
                            basis, for which multi-year capital funds should be requested of the
                            Congress. It seems to me essential, if such an institution is to serve
                            foreign policy objectives, that its board of directors should be
                            responsive to the recommendations of the Secretary of State. Such an
                            institution should be empowered to make both hard and soft loans. There
                            is an open question as to whether its charter should not also enable it
                            to make available grant assistance, within certain defined limits, in
                            cases of necessity.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Within the above concept, the State Department would become responsible (a)
                        for the coordinating role for Mutual Security <hi rend="italic">in
                        toto</hi>, <pb n="798" xml:id="pg_798" facs="0824"/>and (b) for the
                        operating role for a large segment thereof. I do not wish to minimize the
                        fact that this would, in my judgment, require very considerable changes
                        within the State Department, increases in personnel, budget, and in other
                        respects.</p>
                    <p>If the above proposal is judged infeasible for one reason or another, I would
                        recommend that we stick to the present organizational arrangements within
                        the U.S. Government and reach an affirmative decision to pull together to
                        persuade the Congress to continue these present arrangements, rather than
                        attempt to split up the present functions of <gloss target="#t_FOA1"
                            >FOA</gloss>, thereby increasing the difficulties of coordination and
                        failing to meet the essential desiderata of the Congress.</p>

                            Secretary Dulles. It reads as follows: <p>“There was discussion of the
                                possibility of reorganizing the present functions of <gloss
                                    target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> along the following
                                lines:</p><p>“1. Military assistance programs and Defense support
                                programs to be administered by the Department of Defense once the
                                policy and amount had been decided on with the concurrence of
                                State.</p><p>“2. Economic assistance to take primarily the form of
                                ‘soft’ loans and to be made by the Treasury Department under the
                                direction of the Department of State. Treasury would be authorized
                                to advance funds under these circumstances up to some agreed amount,
                                say $500,000,000 to $1,000,000,000, and when this amount was
                                exhausted then the matter would go back again to the Congress for
                                further authorizations if deemed desirable.</p><p>“3. Policing of
                                the Battle Act to be turned over to the Department of
                                Commerce.</p><p>“4. Handling of Technical Cooperation programs

                        would want me to give you my considered reaction to these proposals, even
                        though my view may run counter to what has already been tentatively
                        agreed.</p>
                    <pb n="799" xml:id="pg_799" facs="0825"/>
                    <p>I should say first that I fully appreciate the difficulties, both substantive
                        and of a personal nature, involved in a decision on this subject and I am
                        very happy that an initiative has been taken to face the issue and to
                        resolve it. However, if I understand correctly the nature of the proposed
                        solution, I must state my conviction that it moves us in the wrong
                        direction. I think those most closely connected with the foreign economic
                        field, including the foreign aid field, are unanimous in their opinion that
                        what is needed is more consolidation, not less. Certainly this is my own
                        conviction. The purpose of all of our actions in the foreign economic field,
                        including the Mutual Security Program with its military segment, is to
                        provide a tool to help fulfill our foreign policy objectives as determined
                        by the President and the Secretary of State. The Mutual Security Program, in
                        particular, is a single tool and can best be utilized to promote our foreign
                        policy when it is regarded and administered as a single tool. To divide this
                        tool among various agencies of government is to diminish its effectiveness,
                        however much cooperation and agreement is achieved among the heads of the
                        departments involved. It has been my experience that the inevitable workings
                        of departmental bureaucracies tend to segment and compartmentalize the
                        activities for which the various departments are responsible, and that no
                        amount of topside coordination can bring about a truly unified effort where
                        the various functional parts are distributed among a number of different
                        agencies and departments. My conclusion on this point, I think, is validated
                        by the history of the Mutual Security Program. Experience and
                        trial-and-error over the past five years has led to the conclusion that the
                        administration of these programs should be consolidated, rather than
                        proliferated. It is not enough, I think, to attempt to consolidate them on a
                            <hi rend="italic">policy</hi> level. It is necessary also, in so far as
                        possible, to consolidate them on an <hi rend="italic">operational</hi>
                        level.</p>
                    <p>I believe it is in the United States interest to continue for an indefinite
                        period the major activities of the Mutual Security Program. Changes in the
                        form of assistance, different and better techniques, longer range planning,
                        perhaps a different and better distribution of U.S. resources by area, are
                        doubtless needed and should be under constant consideration. Some of the
                        peripheral activities of the <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> (several of
                        which are imposed by legislation) should be dropped. But the major
                        components of this activity, I believe, are in the interest of the United
                        States so long as the cold war continues, and perhaps thereafter.</p>
                    <p>I think the decision to acquiesce in the “Mansfield Amendment”<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d221fn3">See the memorandum by Nolting to the Secretary of

                        wise one, since to buck this amendment would result in the <pb n="800"
                            xml:id="pg_800" facs="0826"/>alienation of support for the programs
                        themselves, to an extent that would jeopardize their authorization and the
                        appropriation of necessary funds to conduct them. I am quite clear, however,
                        that what the proponents of this amendment had in mind was not the
                        scattering of these functions throughout the government, but rather the
                        consolidation of the essential ones into two old-line departments of the
                        government—namely, the Departments of State and Defense.</p>
                    <p>I understand your reluctance to take back into the State Department a large
                        operating branch. It was, however, the clear desire of the Congress that the
                        non-military parts of the Mutual Security Program should be conceived,
                        formulated, presented, and administered by the Department of State. This was
                        for two reasons: to assure the Congress that these programs are in fact a
                        necessary tool of our foreign policy, and to bring about a unified
                        administration of them, both at home and abroad. It was also the clear
                        intention of the Congress that the military parts of the program should be
                        conducted by the Department of Defense, under the policy guidance of the
                        Secretary of State.</p>
                    <p>I do not believe the tentative decisions of yesterday, as I understand them,
                        accomplish the objectives of the Congress, nor do I think they are
                        administratively sound. Those proposals, as I understand them, envisage the
                        introduction of at least two and perhaps more operating agencies, and the
                        elimination of one. The two additions would be the Treasury Department and
                        the Commerce Department (for the Battle Act) and perhaps some other agency
                        or agencies for the Technical Cooperation Program, besides the Department of
                        Defense for military programs and for economic “defense support” grant
                        assistance. This would presumably leave the responsibility for the
                        coordination of the various programs with the Secretary of State, who could
                        not, in my judgment, exercise adequate control over their operation. I think
                        Mr. Saltzman could give you a first-hand account of the difficulty he
                        experienced in giving policy guidance to the “Occupied Areas Branch” of the
                        Defense Department, which was engaged in the economic aid business after
                        World War II, and I feel that such experience is relevant to your
                        consideration of this problem.</p>
                    <p>As stated in my memorandum to you of yesterday,<note n="4" xml:id="d221fn4"

                        to try to persuade the Congress to continue some such central coordinating

                    <p>The Mutual Security Act of 1954 requires that the Foreign Operations
                        Administration “shall cease to exist” by June 30, 1955. Therefore, it is
                        necessary that a decision be reached on arrangements for carrying on those
                        functions of the <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> which are deemed
                        essential to U.S. security. The Mutual Security Program should be
                        reorganized in a manner which will disrupt as little as possible the
                        functioning of its several parts. To achieve the maximum of Congressional
                        support and good-will for the Mutual Security <pb n="805" xml:id="pg_805"
                            facs="0831"/>Program, the President may wish to make known to
                        Congressional leaders his basic decision in this matter promptly.</p>
                    <p>The following suggestions for reorganization are based upon a distinction
                        between the <hi rend="italic">operating functions</hi> under the Mutual
                        Security Programs on the one hand, and the <hi rend="italic">functions of
                            planning, policy direction, overall supervision</hi>, and <hi
                            rend="italic">operational coordination</hi>, on the other. Since the
                        basic purpose of the Mutual Security Act is to promote the foreign policy
                        and security of the United States, it is essential that the Secretary of
                        State should exercise a large measure of overall responsibility over it.
                        However, in order to keep the Secretary of State free of over-burdening
                        operational duties, it is desirable, and is believed feasible, to
                        decentralize the operating functions under the Mutual Security Program and
                        to distribute them among the regular departments of the government. The
                        exact distribution and placement of these functions should be the subject of
                        a careful study and recommendation to the President, and no fixed pattern
                        should be adopted in advance of such a study and recommendation. However, as
                        an example of the way in which the present Mutual Security functions might
                        be fitted into the operations of the regular departments of government, the

                    <p>The President opened the meeting by noting that the past year had left much
                        unfinished business, which would constitute a large part of the program for
                        the coming year, and that there would not be a great deal of material new to
                        the Leaders. He felt the task of getting a program through would be more
                        difficult because of Democratic control of the Congress, that there would
                        have to be some experimentation on procedures in dealing with this new
                        situation, <pb n="810" xml:id="pg_810" facs="0836"/>but that it was helpful
                        to have already developed pretty well procedures for doing business among
                        Republicans.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of budget and fiscal matters, foreign policy, and
                        defense matters.]</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Mutual Security</hi>—Mr. Stassen pointed out that <gloss
                            target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> continued to be responsible for preparing
                        and presenting the program for the following year even though it would no
                        longer be in business. How to handle the program after June 30th was
                        something for the President and Congress to decide.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stassen then outlined a “Partnership Program” stressing that the bulk of
                        the program would be devoted to Korea and Indo-China, that the entire
                        program was developed on the basis of strengthening places where we had
                        airbases or helping places where it was to our interest to keep the
                        Communists from establishing airbases.</p>
                    <p>Sen. Knowland expressed his disappointment that the Yugoslavs had abstained
                        from the vote (<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>?) expressing moral
                        indignation as to the 13 prisoners. Mr. Bridges asked about rumors that the
                        Russians and the Yugoslavs were growing together again. Mr. Stassen said the
                        Russians had a drive on for this purpose but that we will succeed in holding
                        Yugoslavia out of the orbit.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stassen then quickly went over charts showing the heavy drain of security
                        measures on the economies of our friends in the Asian area, also regarding
                        trade of Japan, Pakistan, etc. For Iran, our assistance will be returned to
                        a loan basis rather than grant. The President noted that he was having lunch
                        with the Shah, also that our desire was for Iran to strengthen its force of
                        90,000 men rather than enlarging it. Mr. Stassen also showed charts on our
                        raw material requirements for future years and where they must come from as
                        related to our mutual security program; a chart on the intensified Russian
                        effort in economic warfare; one on the Agricultural Surplus Program, and
                        another on US Private Investment Abroad.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hensel presented the Mutual Defense Assistance Program, stating that the
                        big problem involved the switches in programs to meet emergencies. Many
                        major ones had already occurred this year that could not be foreseen when
                        the program was presented to Congress earlier in 1954. He and Mr. McNeil
                        answered a number of questions from Senators Knowland and Bridges about
                        carryovers and bookkeeping procedures.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of the trade program, miscellaneous matters,
                        reciprocal trade, the highway and health programs, various labor and
                        agricultural matters, postal rates and pay, housing, and the “Buy American”
                        program. For text of the section on the trade program, see page 218.]</p>

                    <p>The President opened the meeting with a brief outline of the topics scheduled
                        for discussion but made it clear that the Leaders could appropriately raise
                        other items if they wished. He was hopeful of developing a meeting of the
                        minds.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of the budget, Foreign Relations, the foreign trade
                        program, and national defense. For text of the section on foreign trade, see
                            <ref target="#pg_112">page 112</ref>]</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Mutual Security</hi>—Mr. Stassen characterized this program
                        as one devoted to facilitating our air base program and denying bases to the
                        Communists, as helping fulfill our long term strategic needs and
                        strengthening our economy generally.</p>
                    <p>He noted that Europe had just had its best year economically since World War
                        II, that European countries needed to maintain a mobilization base there,
                        and that it would be desirable for them soon to reach a position where they
                        could contribute to the development of less advanced areas of the world.
                        This was particularly true since the Soviets were now using trade as an
                        instrument of policy and also were offering technical assistance as we had
                        been doing for some time. Sen. Johnson ascertained that, to our knowledge,
                        Russia had thus far offered about $111 million of technical assistance. Sen.
                        Knowland was interested in how much of this was already in effect. Mr. Taber
                        inquired and was informed that our trade agreements under this program were
                        mostly barter, as in the case of taking Icelandic fish because of Iceland’s
                        economic requirements. Mr. Stassen then referred to our plans for expanding
                        the Point Four program, especially by contracting the services of US
                        universities. This had a double advantage of helping us to reach the
                        intellectuals of the countries we work with.</p>
                    <p>Korea, said Mr. Stassen, would remain a large part of the program, though
                        less than the current year, because of the remaining need for rebuilding the
                        country and particularly for underpinning the twenty Korean divisions—which
                        are just too much for an economy like Korea’s. Some of the 1955 Indo-China
                        money is to be used in other parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>
                    <p>Answering Sen. Wiley, Mr. Stassen pointed out that 75% of <gloss
                            target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> money is spent directly to purchase
                        materials in the United States. The other 25% is for purchases abroad or for
                        direct cash payments. Sen. Wiley asked if it were true that sooner or later
                        all of this money comes back to the United States. Mr. Stassen agreed that
                        much of it does, and the remainder strengthens their economies for other
                        trade helpful to the United States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stassen corrected Sen. Russell’s belief that the Indo-China money had
                        merely been turned over to the French after the Geneva settlement. He made
                        clear that the program was subject to <pb n="813" xml:id="pg_813"
                            facs="0839"/>GAO scrutiny, then went on to discuss the economic needs of
                        that country and of Japan.</p>
                    <p>With charts, Mr. Stassen showed how our aid to other countries had paid off
                        during our own recent economic difficulties, for exports of both industrial
                        and agricultural products had stood up well while domestic sales were
                        reduced.</p>
                    <p>Sen. Wiley asked further about unobligated balances for Southeast Asia. Mr.
                        Stassen stressed that most of what was available in unexpended balances was
                        for military items which take a long lead time. The carryover this year will
                        be less than in the past and would be still further reduced in the coming
                        year. Mr. Cannon thought it highly important to keep on with reducing the
                        carryover.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Richards asked about economic aid or direct support to Europe, and Mr.
                        Stassen told him there was none except for Berlin, Spain and Yugoslavia. Mr.
                        Richards wondered if the request for funds for military items for Europe
                        would be directed to the Military Committees of the Congress, but Mr.
                        Stassen felt that was a matter for the Congress to decide. Richards then
                        asked if the program involved a great deal of offshore procurement and Mr.
                        Stassen replied that it was on a declining trend.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hensel presented the military side of the program, stressing that it is
                        virtually impossible to follow any rigid plan because of the almost
                        continuous changes in the world picture which require almost constant
                        programming. He stated that some $380 million had already been transferred
                        this year for things that could not be predicted firmly enough to warrant
                        advance programming. About $225 million had been transferred from the
                        military to the economic part of the program, not under Defense Department
                        responsibility.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hensel devoted considerable attention to carryovers, new requests, and
                        planned expenditures. The entire program was being kept under review to see
                        that programs accord with realistic force goals rather than unrealistic
                        targets. He indicated that consideration was being given to the use of “new
                        weapons” in Europe, a radical factor that might be introduced into the
                        program.</p>
                    <p>Summarizing, Mr. Hensel thought approximately $1.4 billion new funds would be
                        needed this year, also the establishment of an emergency fund to avoid
                        transfers, and generally less rigid programming.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Conclusion</hi>—The President discussed and agreed with the
                        Leaders that January 6th would be the date for the State of the Union
                        address—incidentally Mr. Rayburn’s birthday.</p>
                    <p>The President again stated his great hope that all of these programs would
                        always be considered in an honest bipartisan way. He <pb n="814"
                            xml:id="pg_814" facs="0840"/>recognized that initiative in these areas
                        was not a monopoly of the Executive Branch and he would give full attention
                        to things begun in the Congress. He assured the leaders that he and other
                        Administration officials would always be available for discussion of these
                        programs to the end that they be executed in a nonpartisan way. And he was
                        open to suggestions on procedures for any necessary discussions, whether
                        through the Republican leaders or directly to the President.</p>
                    <p>After inquiring as to any further questions or comments, the President said
                        that the State of the Union message was taking firm shape and that he would
                        assume from this morning’s discussion that there exists basic agreement on
                        all of these programs, but not in such detail as to freeze any one in a
                        fixed position.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hagerty then read and obtained approval of a draft statement to be made
                        following the meeting.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Hughes</hi>: It is noted that in the draft of
                        the Budget Message, you have included two alternative sections for decision
                        as to the future administrative arrangements for the conduct of the
                        President’s Mutual Security Program.</p>
                    <p>May I respectfully suggest a third alternative which after careful review and
                        consideration as objective as it is possible for me to give under the
                        circumstances, I believe would be the most advantageous for the President to
                        take. I am enclosing a draft of language so that you may see precisely what
                        I have in mind.</p>
                    <p>The elements of my recommendation to the President are as follows: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>There are a number of diverse strongly held views in the Congress
                                on this matter, and it has been a subject of Congressional
                                difference every year from the first setting up of the Marshall
                                Plan. Thus a specific recommendation to the Congress at this time
                                either in support of <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> or for some
                                other solution would encounter Congressional opposition which would
                                prejudice the crucial matter of Congressional action on the
                                substance of the Mutual Security Program itself.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Conversely, the President’s expressed willingness to confer with
                                Congress on this subject will build goodwill toward the President’s
                                program.</item>
                            <pb n="815" xml:id="pg_815" facs="0841"/>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>When final action is taken by the Congress, a provision that the
                                new organization would become effective six months after
                                Congressional enactment is essential for a smooth transition, for
                                the effective carrying on of the vital week-by-week activities
                                involved in the program, and for giving a fair opportunity to the
                                career employees who in an overwhelming percentage are sincerely,
                                devotedly, and loyally carrying on the program, to make some
                                arrangements for their continuance or to have a reasonable
                                opportunity to obtain new employment.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>It is my judgment that a Presidential position along these lines would
                        receive unanimous approval of the bipartisan Congressional leadership before
                        the Budget Message is sent up, and that during the course of the
                        Congressional session, as the bipartisan leaders of the Committees directly
                        concerned talked it through, a reasonably unanimous decision on the new
                        organization would then be reached satisfactory to the President and to the
                        Secretary of State. This process would facilitate rather than prejudice the
                        consideration of the substance of the program. The basic necessity of the
                        six months’ period from the time of adoption to the time it becomes
                        effective is of key importance, as I am certain you can realize under any
                        circumstances.</p>
                    <p>If you wish, I shall be pleased to discuss this with you further, or with the
                        President.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                        <p>In view of the necessity for the Mutual Security Program to continue for
                            some years, a decision must be made before June 30, 1955, on how to
                            organize the Executive Branch of the Government to carry out these
                            responsibilities. It is recognized that there are, and have been since
                            the initiation of programs of this nature seven years ago, various views
                            as to the most effective and desirable organization of the Government
                            for the conducting of this important work in the national interest.</p>
                        <p>The close coordination of the various activities of technical assistance,
                            defense support, economic development, emergency and disaster relief,
                            and refugee and escapee work, and the functioning of the entire
                            operation under the constant and consistent foreign policy <pb n="816"
                                xml:id="pg_816" facs="0842"/>guidance of the Secretary of State is
                            imperative. These are the principal reasons which prompted me to propose
                            a reorganization plan establishing the Foreign Operations Administration
                            in 1953. It is my observation that this method has been an effective and
                            efficient manner of carrying out these programs so important to the
                            security and well being of the United States. It is recognized,
                            nevertheless, that under existing law the Foreign Operations
                            Administration would expire on June 30, 1955. I will, therefore, be
                            pleased to confer with the Congress and reach agreement on the new
                            administrative organization to carry on the Mutual Security Program in
                            the future years. Whatever the final decision may be, it will be of
                            prime importance that the new organization go into effect six months
                            after its enactment so that an opportunity may be available for a smooth
                            transition from the present organization to the new one. This transition
                            is important so that the week-to-week work can be conducted in the
                            national interest with a minimum of disruption, and the status of the
                            career employees who are serving with loyalty and devotion around the
                            world can be fairly and adequately safeguarded.</p>
