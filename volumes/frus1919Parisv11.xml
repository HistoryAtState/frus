                <p>The regular meetings of the American Commissioners Plenipotentiary were attended
                    by two or more of the Commissioners, excepting President Wilson, and minutes
                    were kept by a secretary and duplicated for distribution. The Department files
                    contain incomplete minutes of a meeting on December 30, 1918 (see <ref

                <p>Questions were presented to the Commissioners in the form of numbered memoranda

                    <p>1. General Bliss began the discussion on a resolution which was passed
                        yesterday at the Quai d’Orsay to the effect that the members of the Supreme
                        War Council should meet to decide on the number of troops which it would be
                        considered equitable for the members of the associated governments to send
                        to the former territories of the Turkish Empire.<note n="1" xml:id="d1fn1"
                            >See BC–18, <ref target="frus1919Parisv03#pg_817">vol. <hi
                                    rend="smallcaps">iii</hi>, p. 817</ref>.</note> The diplomatic
                        aspect of the question was brought up owing to the fact that the United
                        States was not at war with Turkey, but had merely broken off diplomatic
                        relations. General Bliss wished to know whether the President would be in
                        any way embarrassed if he decided that the United States should refuse to
                        send any troops to Turkey.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing was of the opinion that any decision which General Bliss decided
                        to render in the premises should be so hypothetical that if it was found
                        necessary, the President would be able, on political grounds, to back down
                        from the resolution taken yesterday.</p>
                    <p>General Bliss asked whether he should therefore decide only what he
                        considered a fair distribution of the troops of the associated
                        governments.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that any conclusion arrived at by General Bliss should begin
                        with approximately the following wording: “If it is considered advisable,
                        and the consent of the Turkish government is given thereto, the number of
                        American troops etc., etc.,”</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0038"/>
                    <p>[2.] Colonel House stated that he had had a long interview with Mr. Orlando
                        last night regarding the draft of a constitution of a League of Nations
                        prepared by President Wilson, and that he had found that they were in
                        agreement on many points. There were two objections however, which Mr.
                        Orlando had to make.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>1. That all of the territory of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire should
                            be placed under the control of the League of Nations since that would
                            necessitate that the Trentino, Istria and Triest be placed under
                            international control rather than be incorporated into the Italian
                            State. Orlando desired that this paragraph “Supplementary Agreement No.
                            1” should be altered so that only those territories of the
                            Austro-Hungarian Empire which were not otherwise disposed of in the
                            treaty of peace should be controlled by the League of Nations.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing observed that if such an amendment were made, all the British
                        Dominions would desire that similar clauses be incorporated so that some of
                        the German colonies could be separately disposed of in the treaty of
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that the amendment suggested by Orlando was not satisfactory
                        and that this matter would require further study.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>2. That by the adoption of Article 4 of the proposed draft Italy would
                            have to limit its military forces to volunteer organizations, which
                            would be absolutely impracticable because of the conditions in Italy.
                            The Italian army was paid such a very small stipend that the conditions
                            of service were not attractive enough to make practical a volunteer
                            organization. Orlando viewed favorably the limitation of armaments, but
                            felt that for Italy it was necessary that some form of conscription be
                            retained.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>Colonel House and Mr. Lansing both stated that they appreciated the force of
                        Orlando’s argument and that it would undoubtedly be necessary to have some
                        form of modified conscription in many countries in order to obtain a
                        sufficient army to carry out the mandates of the League of Nations. Mr.
                        White thought likewise it would be inadvisable for the United States to
                        commit itself definitely on this point and that he was glad that this
                        question would be reviewed.</p>
                    <p>General Bliss observed that there were only two kinds of armies, volunteer
                        and conscripted armies, and that in principle he believed in the abolition
                        of the conscripted army. He also however, recognized the weight of Mr.
                        Orlando’s objection.</p>
                    <p>Colonel House stated that the President had asked him to consult with General
                        Bliss about drafting a substitute for Article 4 which would obviate the
                        objection made by Mr. Orlando.</p>
                    <p>General Bliss stated that he would study this matter and draft a substitute
                        for Article 4.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0039"/>
                    <p>3. Mr. Lansing quoted President Wilson as having stated a belief that at the
                        end of this week or soon thereafter an agreement on the plan for the League
                        of Nations could be reached. This appeared very doubtful because of the many
                        objections which seem to be arising in regard to specific details in the
                        drafting of the constitution.</p>
                    <p>Colonel House observed that Lord Robert Cecil had already gone through the
                        President’s draft in great detail with Mr. Miller and that he (Colonel
                        House) was to have a meeting with General Smuts and Cecil tonight to
                        consider the matter further. Tomorrow night he was to have another
                        conference with Orlando to see if the objections which had just been
                        discussed could be overcome. It was hoped that a general meeting could take
                        place next week to begin the final discussions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing stated that he thought it was very important that the President
                        should not return to the United States until some definite and concrete
                        resolution in regard to the League of Nations had been adopted, and that in
                        view of the delays which would inevitably arise from the discussions of the
                        details it might perhaps be more advisable to have the conference agree on
                        the general principles, leaving the settlement of the details to a specially
                        appointed Commission. Colonel House said that he had tried to persuade the
                        President of the advisability of such a line of action but that he was
                        afraid it was now too late. Mr. Lansing added that he had a supplementary
                        resolution already prepared which he desired to discuss with Colonel House,
                        and which they might induce the President to bring up at the Conference
                        instead of insisting on the immediate settlement of the whole question.</p>
                    <p>4. Colonel House read a telegram which he had received from Baron Slatin<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d1fn3">General Rudolph Slatin, Austrian Red Cross
                            representative in negotiations concerning prisoners of war.</note> as
                        follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Have sent telegrams to Ministers Lansing, Balfour and Pichon to

                                if you kindly lend me your help that President Wilson takes a

                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The Commissioners agreed that there was no objection to complying with the
                        wishes of Baron Slatin, and Colonel House offered to take up the matter with
                        Mr. Balfour and Mr. Pichon.</p>
                    <p>Colonel House withdrew.</p>
                    <p>5. Mr. Lansing, Mr. White and General Bliss discussed the possibility of
                        amending Article 4 to the President’s draft in order to meet the views of
                        Mr. Orlando,<note n="4" xml:id="d1fn4">See minute 2, item 2, <hi
                                rend="italic">supra.</hi></note> and at the same time provide for
                        the limitation <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0040"/>of large standing
                        armies. No decision was arrived at and the discussion was postponed until a
                        later date.</p>
                    <p>6. Mr. Herter read a memorandum prepared by the Secretariat, regarding a
                        desire expressed by Dr. Mezes to have Lieut. Jefferson of the Aerial Service
                        in France assigned to the Commission as an assistant to the Cartographer.
                        General Bliss stated that he had received a confidential letter from
                        Secretary Baker regarding the number of officers who had already been
                        assigned to the Commission. General Bliss believed that too many assignments
                        had already been made through personal friends and that the question of
                        further assignments should not be considered until a study could be made of
                        the present personnel on the Commission.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that no action should be taken on the Secretariat’s memorandum
                        No. 10<note n="5" xml:id="d1fn5">The numbered memoranda referred to in the
                            course of these minutes were those prepared for use in submitting
                            specific questions for the consideration of the American Commissioners
                            at their regular meetings. Except for Memorandum No. 376, <ref
                                target="#pg_591">p. 591</ref>, they have not been printed.</note>
                        until each of the Commissioners had been furnished with a full list of the
                        personnel now assigned to the Commission.</p>
                    <p>7. Mr. Herter stated that Mr. Frank Bohn and Mr. Charles Edward Russell were
                        present in Paris and wished to go to the International Socialist Conference
                        in Berne. Inasmuch as the Conference began on the 3rd of February however,
                        they were unable to arrive in time unless the Commission decided to assist
                        in facilitating the visaing of their passports. Mr. Lansing stated that he
                        knew Mr. Russell well and that he considered him a very reliable and loyal
                        American whose opinion on the Conference at Berne would be very valuable. He
                        also believed that if Mr. Bohn was traveling with Mr. Russell, he also must
                        be reliable.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that the Commissioners should facilitate the journey of
                        Messrs. Bohn and Russell to Berne, but that any action in the premises
                        should be informal and verbal.</p>
                    <p>8. Mr. Herter read Memorandum No. 11 to the Commissioners, regarding the
                        withdrawal of all troops of occupation from Montenegro.</p>
                    <p>The recommendation that no action should be taken in this matter at the
                        present time was approved by all the Commissioners.</p>
                    <p>[9.] Mr. Herter read a letter addressed by Admiral Benson to the President,
                        requesting that he be authorized to confer with the naval representatives of
                        the five great powers with a view to drawing up in definite form just what
                        terms should be imposed upon the enemy as strictly naval peace terms. The
                        President’s reply to this letter, approving of the Admiral’s suggestion, and
                        requesting Mr. Lansing to lay this matter before his colleagues on the Peace
                        Delegation, was also read.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0041"/>
                    <p>It was decided that it would be advisable for Admiral Benson to confer with
                        the naval representatives of the five great Powers for the purpose
                        indicated, and Mr. Lansing stated that he would authorize Admiral Benson
                        accordingly.</p>
                    <p>10. Mr. Herter read Memorandum No. 9 regarding the representative of the
                        United States at a proposed conference for the adoption of rules of aerial
                        navigation. It was brought out that Admiral Benson and General Kernan as
                        well as the President did not see any great utility in the proposed
                        conference. The Commissioners agreed that more pressing matters were now
                        coming up for consideration, but believed that if the State Department in
                        Washington had already committed itself definitely on this point it would be
                        too late to retract.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that the suggested letter to the President and the suggested
                        telegram to the Department of State, which were attached to Memorandum No. 9
                        should be despatched.</p>
                    <p>11. Mr. Herter read a letter to the President drafted for Mr. Lansing’s
                        signature by Mr. Grew, regarding the action of the French Embassy in
                        Switzerland in refusing passports into France to the representatives of
                        Circassian and Georgian Republics, and other States whose political views do
                        not agree with those of the French government. The letter recommended that
                        an immediate discussion of this matter should take place with the French and
                        other Allied governments.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that the letter in question should be despatched to the
                        President.</p>
                    <p>12. Mr. Herter read Memorandum No. 12 in which the Secretariat inquired to
                        which of the technical advisors the Commissioners desired that the minutes
                        of the informal conferences at the Quai d’Orsay should be sent.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that the minutes in question should be sent to the following
                        technical advisors: <list>

                        </list></p>
                    <p>13. Mr. White stated that Mr. Buckler<note n="6" xml:id="d1fn6">William H.
                            Buckler, special assistant in the Embassy in Great Britain.</note> had
                        last night had conversation with certain members of the British Delegation
                        and he had ascertained that the British government was willing to send
                        representatives to Princes Island even though only the Bolsheviki would be
                        there to meet them. Mr. Lansing stated that he did not believe that the
                        Bolsheviki would come to any such meeting. Mr. White <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6"
                            facs="0042"/>stated that Mr. Kerr, Lloyd George’s Secretary, believed
                        that the Bolsheviki would come to the Conference.<note n="7" xml:id="d1fn7"
                            >For papers relating to the proposed conference at Princes Island

                    <p>Mr. Lansing inquired whether Mr. Buckler discussed the question of Mr.
                            Ransome<note n="8" xml:id="d1fn8">Arthur Ransome, correspondent of the
                            London <hi rend="italic">Daily News.</hi></note> with the British
                        Delegation. Mr. White stated that he was not informed on this point but
                        would ask Mr. Buckler and convey his answer to the Commissioners at the next
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>14. Mr. Herter asked whether the Commissioners desired to initial any record
                        of the decisions which they reached during their Conference. It was agreed
                        that this was not necessary, but that the Secretary should make a note of
                        all decisions arrived at.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners agreed that they would be glad to receive agenda together
                        with the pertinent documents on questions which were to be brought up at
                        each of their meetings in order that they might study these questions before
                        hand. The Commissioners realized that this procedure would only be possible
                        when the action was not urgently required in any particular case.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that the Secretariat should be advised of this wish.</p>

                    <p>1. Mr. Lansing stated that Major James Brown Scott had been definitely
                        assigned to be the second member with Mr. White on the Committee for the
                        study of Waterways, Ports, Railways, etc., and that Mr. Miller was to serve
                        on the Committee to determine the responsibility for the war. Mr. White
                        inquired whether these two appointments had been notified to the French
                        Foreign Office, and Mr. Herter was delegated to ascertain whether this had
                        been done, and if not, to see that the notification was effected as soon as
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>2. Mr. Lansing summed up briefly the questions which had been discussed at
                        the Quai d’Orsay, indicating that only the testimony of Roumania and Serbia
                        had been heard with regard to their conflicting claims in the Banat of
                        Temesvar. Mr. Lansing stated he believed that all territorial questions of
                        this nature as well as those affecting other <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7"
                            facs="0043"/>Balkan States and the Near East could only be considered as
                        a whole and not as separate issues between individual States. Mr. White
                        concurred in this opinion.</p>
                    <p>3. Mr. Herter read Memorandum No. 15 of January 31st regarding Mr. Ray
                        Stannard Baker’s suggestion that his assistant, Mr. Sweetser, have his
                        salary raised to $500 per month.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that the increase in Mr. Sweetser’s salary should not be
                        granted, but that the Commissioners would receive further evidence in the
                        premises if Mr. Baker had any to present.</p>
                    <p>4. Mr. Herter read Memorandum No. 16 inquiring whether the Commissioners
                        approved that the official visiting cards of persons attached to the
                        Commission be paid for by the Department of State.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that this item should be paid for by each individual ordering
                        cards from the Ceremonial office.</p>
                    <p>5. Mr. Herter read Memorandum No. 17 inquiring whether the Commissioners
                        approved a suggestion made by Dr. Bowman that an offer by the American
                        Geographical Society to provide $1000 for the purchase of maps for the
                        present use of the Commission and for the later use of the Society should be
                        accepted.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that Dr. Bowman’s suggestion be followed and the offer of the
                        American Geographical Society accepted.</p>
                    <p>6. Mr. Herter read Memorandum No. 18 recommending that in view of the feeling
                        that the Brazilian Delegates now in Paris had not had as free access to our
                        Commission as they wished, Dr. Pessoa,<note n="8a" xml:id="d2fn8a">Epitacio
                            da Silva Pessõa.</note> another Delegate from Brazil who will shortly
                        arrive in Paris should be received by one of the American Commissioners.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that both Mr. Lansing and Mr. White would be glad to receive
                        Dr. Pessoa and that a telegram to the Department of State be drafted,
                        informing the Department of the decision of the Commissioners, and
                        requesting that this information be brought to the attention of Mr. Da
                            Gama.<note n="9" xml:id="d2fn9">Brazilian Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs.</note></p>
                    <p>Colonel House entered the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Colonel House stated that he had consulted with Lord Robert Cecil and others
                        in regard to the suggestion made at yesterday’s meeting of the Commissioners
                        by Mr. Lansing that the general principles for the League of Nations be
                        settled upon before the President returns to the United States, and the
                        details of the constitution be worked out later. Colonel House was very
                        skeptical of the success of such a motion because the matter had now gone
                        too far. Colonel House stated that a Drafting Committee consisting of Mr.
                        Hurst for the British Delegation, and Mr. Miller for the American Delegation
                        had been appointed, to which the proposed constitution for a League of
                        Nations had been referred.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0044"/>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing stated that he knew Mr. Hurst very well, having been associated
                        with him several years ago on an international commission …</p>
                    <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>7. Colonel House stated that he had ascertained that Dr. Barton formerly of
                        the Armenian and Syrian Relief Committee was at present in Borne. Mr.
                        Lansing gave to Mr. Herter a letter which he had addressed to the President
                        and which had been approved by the President, suggesting that Dr. Barton
                        serve with Mr. Frederick C. Howe on a commission to Turkey. Colonel House
                        requested Mr. Herter to have a telegram drafted for Dr. Barton in Rome,
                        asking him whether he would serve with Mr. Howe on a commission of two to
                        visit Syria and Asia Minor and report his findings to the American
                        Commission to Negotiate Peace. Dr. Barton could be informed that it would
                        not be necessary for him to return to Paris before undertaking this mission
                        inasmuch as instructions could be sent by Mr. Howe.</p>
                    <p>8. Mr. Lansing felt that matters in the Jugo-Slav territory were going from
                        bad to worse, and that it was necessary for us to take some definite action.
                        He read a draft of a possible Declaration which had been prepared by Mr.
                        Dulles, of which the following is a text: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                their freedom from foreign oppression, the Jugo-Slavs formerly under
                                Austro-Hungarian rule on various occasions expressed the desire to
                                unite with the Kingdom of Serbia. The Serbian Government, on its
                                part, has published and officially accepted the Union of the Serb,
                                Croat and Slovene peoples. The Government of the United States
                                therefore welcomes the Union while recognizing that the final
                                settlement of territorial frontiers must be left to the Peace
                                Conference for determination according to the desires of the peoples

                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The text quoted above was approved and it was decided that it should be sent
                        to the President for final approval.</p>
                    <p>9. Mr. Lansing stated that he had this morning received from the Secretariat
                        a list of the personnel at present attached to the Peace Commission. He had
                        been appalled by the number of persons attached, and very much feared that
                        if the facts were brought before Congress an immediate investigation would
                        ensue. He felt therefore that immediate action was necessary in order to cut
                        down to the <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0045"/>lowest limit. The figures
                        were read for each of the various branches and departments of the Commission
                        and it was decided that in most of the cases, particularly those of Colonel
                        House, General Churchill, Colonel Van Deman, the Telephone Department and
                        the Communications Department a great reduction should be made. In the case
                        of General Churchill’s and Colonel Van Deman’s Departments all the
                        Commissioners expressed great astonishment at the number of personnel
                        involved, particularly as they were not aware of what these officers did,
                        nor had read any of the documents prepared by them. The Commissioners all
                        believe that these two Bureaus could probably be disposed [<hi rend="italic"
                            >dispensed?</hi>] with. Mr. Lansing thought that one way of solving the
                        problem was to have the Executive Officer of the Commission placed
                        immediately under the Executive Secretary, and that the many separate Boards
                        such as the Supreme War Council, the Shipping Board, Mr. Hoover’s
                        organization etc., should be kept separate and separately accounted for from
                        the Peace Commission.</p>
                    <p>Colonel House suggested that Mr. White be put at the head of a Committee,
                        which would contain besides himself, Mr. Patchin and Mr. McNeir. Mr. White
                        suggested that if such a Committee were formed General Bliss should also be
                        appointed upon it. This Committee was approved.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing believed that in order to perfect the organization of the
                        Commission the regular correspondence bureau should be increased, even
                        though at the expense of many of the technical bureaus. This opinion was
                        shared by the other Commissioners.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that a Committee consisting of Mr. White, General Bliss, Mr.
                        Patchin and Mr. McNeir should immediately investigate every bureau and
                        department of the Commission and reduce its personnel to the very minimum
                        compatible with efficiency and good service.</p>
                    <p>10. Mr. Herter read the following report submitted by Mr. Buckler in regard
                        to a conversation which he had had with a member of the British Commission
                        in accordance with the wishes of the Commissioners as stated in their
                        meeting of January 31, 1919.</p>

                    <p>Colonel House observed that Mr. Bullitt had yesterday prepared a memorandum
                        for the President in regard to the practicability of withdrawing all
                        American troops at Archangel as soon as possible. All the Commissioners
                        agreed that in view of the additional facts presented it would be most
                        advisable for these troops to be withdrawn to Murmansk or some other point
                        in the shortest possible time.<note n="12" xml:id="d2fn12">For papers

                        Minister at Stockholm, requesting the latter to convey discreetly to Mr.
                        Ransome Mr. Buckler’s belief that his coming to Paris would serve no purpose
                        and might prove embarrassing. This telegram was approved by all the

                    </list>
                    <p>1. Mr. Lansing asked General Bliss’ opinion at [<hi rend="italic">of?</hi>]
                        the advisability of requesting Mr. Polk to issue passports to the wives of
                        such officers attached to the Commission as the Secretary of War deemed it
                        proper to come to Paris at the present time. The cases of General Kernan <pb
                            n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0047"/>and Major Scott as well as that of
                        Admiral Benson was discussed. General Bliss expressed the opinion that
                        inasmuch as a ruling had previously been made that the wives of officers in
                        the A. E. F. in France should not be allowed to come, it would be
                        inadvisable to make an exception in the case of those officers who were
                        attached to the Commission because such action would mitigate unfairly
                        against the other officers who are now in France, and whose work was just as
                        hard and perhaps as important as those who are attached to the
                        Commission.</p>
                    <p>Memorandum No. 8 dealing with this question was read and it was suggested
                        that perhaps General Bliss’ objections could be overcome by allowing those
                        officers attached to the Commission who wish to have their wives join them
                        in Paris to resign from the army and to remain attached to the Commission
                        with the status of volunteer civilians. This particular course of action was
                        approved by Mr. Lansing in the case of Major Scott because of the unusual
                        circumstances attending this case, but General Bliss believed that a general
                        ruling in this sense would be inadvisable as it would give an unfair
                        advantage to those officers who had independent means, and who would be able
                        to resign their commissions without suffering any material financial
                        loss.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that this whole question should not be settled at this moment
                        but that it should be taken under advisement by each of the
                        Commissioners.</p>
                    <p>2. Memorandum No. 20 regarding Mr. Whitlock’s<note n="13" xml:id="d3fn13"
                            >Brand Whitlock, Minister to Belgium.</note> request for a
                        reconsideration of the decision that a military base of supplies should be
                        established at Rotterdam, rather than at Antwerp was read. Mr. Lansing was
                        unable to see that there was any political question involved, and that this
                        was a military matter pure and simple. Mr. White pointed out that there is
                        considerable jealousy between Holland and Belgium, and that undoubtedly
                        either of the two countries would feel slighted if the other had the
                        American military base of supplies established within its territories. He
                        added that in Holland there was a feeling that Belgium was being too much
                        petted by America and that if the proposed change were made this feeling
                        would increase. Mr. Lansing stated that in his opinion, if it were a
                        question of favoring either Belgium or Holland in this particular instance,
                        he would prefer to favor Holland.</p>
                    <p>General Bliss explained that the base of supplies was to be established at
                        Rotterdam for the purpose of feeding the American Army of Occupation in
                        Germany, that Rotterdam had been chosen not from any political motives but
                        purely out of expediency.</p>
                    <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0048"/>
                    <p>It was decided that inasmuch as this matter was entirely one of expediency,
                        no change in the present plans of the American military authorities should
                        be made, and that Mr. Whitlock should be informed that the political
                        considerations in the premises were not of sufficient importance to justify
                        a change of policy.</p>
                    <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>4. Mr. White stated that he had been asked to call this morning on the French
                        Minister of Commerce, and that he supposed that the question which the
                        latter wished to raise was that of the Chairmanship of the Committee to
                        study the nationalization of Ports, Waterways and Railways. Mr. White
                        believed it possible that the Minister of Commerce would wish to designate
                        him as Chairman of this Committee, and asked the opinion of the other
                        Commissioners on this matter. He was prepared, he stated, to do just as they
                        thought best, but believed that inasmuch as the United States had already
                        been given the Chairmanship of several other Committees, it might be
                        advisable to refuse the offer in this case if it were presented.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing observed that he had just been made Chairman on the Committee for
                        the responsibility of the war. General Bliss believed that representatives
                        of the United States were chosen to be the Chairmen of the various
                        committees because of the impartial attitude which the United States was
                        able to maintain in most of the questions dealt with. Mr. White asked
                        whether the Commissioners would approve of the nomination of Mr. Coromilas
                        for the Chairmanship of the Committee on Ports, Waterways and Railways. Mr.
                        Lansing and General Bliss were afraid that such a nomination might not be
                        acceptable inasmuch as Greece had particular interest in the questions which
                        would be discussed. They both urged Mr. White not to refuse the nomination
                        if it were tendered to him.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that Mr. White should accept the Chairmanship of the Committee
                        to study the nationalization of Ports, Waterways and Railways if it were
                        tendered to him.</p>
                    <p>Mr. White observed that he had this morning discovered that Mr. Miller had
                        been assigned to his Committee as the second representative of the United
                        States in the place of Major Scott. Mr. Lansing explained that this change
                        had been made because Mr. Miller had been studying the question of the
                        League of Nations, and that the nationalization of Ports, Waterways and
                        Railways was closely connected with his other work.</p>
                    <p>5. There was a brief discussion of the findings of the Committee appointed at
                        Saturday’s meeting to investigate the large personnel of the Peace
                        Commission. General Bliss expressed the opinion that the large number of
                        military personnel attached to the Commission should properly be detached,
                        and if necessary, continue its activities under the supervision of the War
                        Department. Mr. Lansing observed that the <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13"
                            facs="0049"/>whole question of military intelligence did not interest
                        him in the least.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing was called to a meeting at the Quai d’Orsay.</p>
                    <p>6. Memorandum No. 22 recommending that Mr. Leon Dominian be attached to the
                        Commission for work on Turkish affairs was read. General Bliss requested
                        that this matter be left for later consideration by all the Commissioners.
                        He observed that as soon as the Committee on the investigation of the
                        Commission personnel had completed its work it would be better able to judge
                        the merits of requests for further assistance.</p>
                    <p>7. Memorandum No. 23 was read and it was decided that Mr. Caldwell the
                        American Minister to Persia would be received by Mr. White as soon as an
                        appointment could be arranged.</p>
                    <p>8. Mr. Herter read Memorandum No. 24 inquiring whether certain privileges
                        could be extended to Major Fling and Lieut. Yewdale who were engaged on
                        behalf of the War Department in writing a history of the war. The
                        Commissioners present agreed that these two officers should receive every
                        facility from the personnel of the Commission in collecting information, but
                        that they should not be allowed to occupy a room in the hotel or use the
                        transportation facilities of the Commission, nor have access to the plenary
                        sessions of the Conference unless they were admitted to the Press Section
                        and unless their attendance at such sessions did not preclude any one else
                        from attending. The Commissioners present however, requested that this
                        matter be brought up again at a full meeting of the Commissioners for final
                        decision.</p>
                    <p>9. Mr. Herter read Memorandum No. 25 regarding the expense of a mission
                        undertaken on behalf of General Churchill by Captain James Bruce and Mr.
                        Ronald Tree.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners decided to decline to pay the expense of Captain Bruce and
                        his party.</p>
                    <p>10. Memorandum No. 27 was read inquiring whether the Commission should
                        entitle Mr. Baruch, Mr. McCormick and Mr. Davis to obtain supplies at the
                        Commission’s expense. It was decided that unless other appropriations were
                        available to care for the expense of the supplies of these three gentlemen
                        they should be borne by the Commission.</p>
                    <p>11. Mr. Herter read Memorandum No. 28 inquiring whether the Commissioners
                        would approve the expenditure of 40 francs a day as subsistence allowance to
                        the officers of the Military Section of the American Commission to Negotiate
                        Peace.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that the officers of the Military Section of the American
                        Peace Commission should not receive the subsistence allowance of 40 francs a
                        day.</p>
                    <p>12. Mr. Herter read Information Memorandum No. 29 containing report by Mr.
                        Hugh Gibson, who had just returned from the Hague, <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14"
                            facs="0050"/>regarding the activities of Lieut. Voska and Mr.
                            Creel’s<note n="14" xml:id="d3fn14">George Creel, Chairman of the
                            Committee on Public Information.</note> utterances in Bohemia, Austria
                        and Hungary. The Commissioners took note of the information contained in the
                        memorandum in question, and expressed the desire to see Mr. Gibson as well
                        as Major Schelling at their meeting tomorrow. In the meanwhile, no action
                        was to be taken in regard to Lieut. Voska.</p>
                    <p>13. Memorandum No. 4 of January 29, 1919 was read, regarding the assignment
                        of Mr. Joseph B. Umpleby to the Commission on behalf of the United States
                        Geological Survey.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Umpleby’s assignment was approved, but General Bliss requested that for
                        personal reasons which he explained to Mr. White, he desired that in
                        notifying the Geological Survey of Mr. Umpleby’s assignment, it should be
                        clearly stated that until further advice no additional personnel from the
                        Geological Survey would be required by the Commission.</p>
                    <p>14. Mr. Herter again brought up Memorandum No. 10 in regard to the assignment
                        of Lieut. Jefferson to assist Mr. Stratton, assistant to the cartographer,
                        and again the Commissioners requested that this question be postponed until
                        the investigation of the Committee upon which Mr. White and General Bliss
                        were both serving, had been completed.</p>
                    <p>15. Memorandum No. 30 was read. The Commissioners present agreed that the
                        members of the Commission, other than the Commissioners, should not be
                        allowed to charge the expense of official guests to the Commission, but felt
                        that this question should be again brought up in the presence of all the
                        Commissioners.</p>
                    <p>16. Information Memorandum No. 31 was read and Mr. White made a note of the
                        opinions of the various factions in Russia in regard to the Prinkipo
                        conference in order to convey this information to the Press at this
                        morning’s meeting.</p>

                        <item>The information contained in a note regarding Mr. Baruch, Mr.
                            McCormick and Mr. Davis receiving the minutes of the secret meetings <pb
                                n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0051"/>at the Quai d’Orsay was
                            discussed. Mr. Lansing stated that he could not understand what Mr.
                            Baruch meant. Both Mr. White and Mr. Lansing referred to their decision
                            made a few days ago that Mr. Baruch, Mr. McCormick and Mr. Davis should
                            not have all the minutes of the secret meetings at the Quai d’Orsay but
                            should certainly receive all those in which they could possibly have any
                            interest. It was observed that there would most likely be considerable
                            complications if Mr. Baruch went to the French for their secret
                            minutes.</item>

                        <item>Memorandum No. 31 was read. It was decided that Mr. Grew should pass
                            finally upon the question of Colonel Williams requesting to be allowed
                            to resign from the army. However, both Mr. White and Mr. Lansing felt
                            that if it would in any way facilitate Colonel Williams’ work here to be
                            acting in the capacity of a civilian, he should certainly be allowed to
                            resign. General Bliss, who had been consulted earlier in the day
                            regarding this matter, was quite convinced that his application for
                            resignation should be approved.</item>

                            francs per day to which persons attached to the Commission are

                            opinion in the matter. They observed however, that in drafting this

                            opinion should be expressed as to the attitude of the Commissioners in

                    <p>1. Mr. Herter read Memorandum prepared for Mr. Grew by Mr. Auchincloss
                        stating that the President had requested Colonel House to advise the
                        Commission that he had designated Professor Charles Seymour and Mr. M. A.
                        Coolidge as the representatives of the United States on the Teschen
                        Commission. Mr. Auchincloss requested Mr. Grew to notify the Commissioners
                        of the above appointments in order that these gentlemen might be advised as
                        soon as possible of their appointment.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing stated that he understood that it was decided by the council of
                        ten that only one representative from each of the Great Powers should be
                        sent on the Teschen Commission. He requested that this matter be
                        investigated at once. He further added that in his opinion it was a mistake
                        for us to send our technical experts on foreign missions, particularly at a
                        time when their services were greatly needed by the Commission. He therefore
                        requested that no notification of the appointments in question be made until
                        the question of the number of representatives had been settled and until he
                        had had <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0053"/>a chance to speak to the
                        President about the appointment of a much needed technical expert.</p>
                    <p>2. Memorandum No. 34 was read regarding a request received by the Secretary
                        of War from the French military representative on the Supreme War Council
                        for a listed statement of the military expenses of the United States since
                        mobilization. Mr. White observed that this request had probably been made by
                        the French government in order to draw a comparison between the war expenses
                        of the associated governments. Mr. Lansing stated that inasmuch as a listed
                        statement of the expenses of the United States in the premises would
                        undoubtedly have to be furnished to Congress in the near future, there would
                        be no objection to furnishing it to the French government.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that a telegram should be sent to the Department of State
                        declaring that in the opinion of the Commissioners there is no objection to
                        furnishing the information in question to the French government from the
                        point of view of the State Department, but that this was a matter for the
                        War Department to decide finally.</p>
                    <p>3. Memorandum No. 35 was read regarding the manner in which the declaration
                        which had been agreed to by the Commission and the President in respect to
                        the welcoming [of] the union of the Jugoslavs should be made.<note n="18"
                            xml:id="d5fn18">See meeting of February 1, minute 8, <ref target="#pg_8"
                                >p. 8</ref>.</note> The recommendations of the Secretariat in this
                        matter were approved, and Mr. Lansing requested that he be furnished with a
                        copy of the proposed statement as well as drafts of the suggested telegrams
                        to the State Department and the American Legation at Belgrade indicating
                        what action it was proposed to pursue in the premises. Mr. Lansing added
                        that he would try to see Mr. Balfour and Mr. Pichon this afternoon and
                        inform them of the statement which he was about to make.</p>
                    <p>4. Memorandum No. 36 was read recommending that a telegram be sent to
                        Professor Coolidge in Vienna expressing the Commission’s appreciation of his
                        work, and make [<hi rend="italic">making?</hi>] two specific inquiries on
                        which information was desired. It was decided that the draft telegram
                        attached to Memorandum No. 36 should be dispatched to Professor
                        Coolidge.</p>
                    <p>In discussing the above memorandum Mr. Lansing observed that he had received
                        certain information in regard to the activities of Mr. Creel in the former
                        territories of Austria-Hungary which had been rather disquieting. Mr. White
                        stated that he had received similar information. Mr. White inquired just
                        what position Mr. Creel held while traveling through German Austria, to
                        which Mr. Lansing replied that he did not know but would be very interested
                        to learn.</p>
                    <p>5. Memorandum No. 37 was read recommending that Mr. Beer be authorized to
                        inform Mr. King the Liberian delegate to the Peace <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18"
                            facs="0054"/>Conference that he (Mr. Beer) had been specifically
                        designated by the Commission to examine any information that the Liberian
                        delegates desired to lay before the American Commission. In the discussion
                        on this memorandum Mr. Lansing observed that the question of Liberia’s
                        frontiers should not be allowed to come before the Peace Conference, but
                        that the question of the German cable certainly deserved consideration. In
                        regard to the frontiers of Liberia Mr. Lansing expressed the opinion that
                        Liberia was having trouble enough governing the territory which it now
                        possessed. It was decided that Mr. Beer should be authorized in the sense of
                        the recommendation contained in Memorandum No. 37.</p>
                    <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>7. Information Memorandum No. 3 was read regarding the indirect report which
                        had been received that Mr. Hoover would be glad to be connected with the
                        Commission on Ports, Waterways and Railways. Mr. Lansing stated that he
                        considered it advisable that Mr. White should discuss this matter with Mr.
                        Hoover in order to ascertain exactly how Mr. Hoover desired to be associated
                        with the Commission in question. Mr. White agreed to this suggestion and
                        added that he would be glad to see Mr. Hoover at once.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing observed that inasmuch as army officers had been chiefly
                        concerned in matters connected with the waterways and ports of the United
                        States it might be well to ascertain which particular officer of the A. E.
                        F. now in France would be well qualified to serve as a technical advisor to
                        the Commission on Ports, Waterways and Railways.</p>
                    <p>7 [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. Memorandum No. 39 was read regarding the
                        suggestion of the British government to the American government that the
                        question of suppressing the illegal trade in opium and other habit forming
                        drugs should be presented to the Peace Conference for disposition. Mr.
                        Lansing observed that in his opinion this matter did not come within the
                        competence of the Peace Conference. He recommended, however, that a telegram
                        be sent to the Department of State indicating that the United States was
                        heartily in sympathy with the idea, but that the question as to whether it
                        was a matter that could be handled in the Peace Treaty could not be
                        determined until the question was actually brought up in Paris. Mr. Lansing
                        felt that we should not commit ourselves further than this.</p>
                    <p>In discussing this memorandum Mr. Lansing commented on the uncompromising and
                        unpleasant attitude which Japan has adopted <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19"
                            facs="0055"/>with regard to China. Mr. White agreed with that comment.
                        Mr. Lansing then inquired whether Mr. White had any definite information
                        regarding the reported secret arrangements between the French and the
                        Japanese. Mr. White observed that he did not. Mr. Lansing then remarked that
                        in his opinion we were not getting away very far from secret diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>8. Memorandum No. 40 was read regarding the payment of an allowance of 40
                        francs per diem for officers of General McKinstry’s staff.<note n="19"
                            xml:id="d5fn19">i. e., the War Damages Board.</note> Mr. Lansing and Mr.
                        White agreed they would be unable to render a decision in this matter
                        without first receiving additional information as to the exact amount of
                        subsistence which officers on duty in Paris or in the field are granted by
                        the army. Mr. Lansing observed that he understood that Mr. McNeir was of the
                        opinion that the per diem allowance of officers attached to the Commission
                        was very high, that it should be reduced to 20 francs per diem. It was
                        decided that this matter should be reconsidered after further information
                        had been put at the disposal of the Commissioners.</p>
                    <p>9. Memorandum No. 41 was read regarding the shortage of rooms in the Hotel de
                        Crillon and the necessity for adopting rules which could be enforced
                        throughout the organization. It was decided that the technical advisors
                        should be allowed only three rooms each as recommended, and that the
                        Secretary be instructed to ask the chief of each office and the head of each
                        department to inquire carefully into their personnel with the object of
                        stating in writing which members of their staff could be housed outside of
                        the hotel without detriment to their work, and the order in which these men
                        should leave this hotel, if their bedrooms are required for office
                        space.</p>
                    <p>Information Memorandum No. 4 was read with regard to the intention of
                        President Cabrera to send a Commission to Paris headed by
                            Toledo-Harrarte<note n="20" xml:id="d5fn20">Luis Toledo-Herrarte.</note>
                        to represent Guatemala at the Conference. Mr. Lansing observed in regard to
                        this matter that President Cabrera was undoubtedly the ablest politician in
                        Central America and knew how to play the game beautifully.</p>
                    <p>Information Memorandum No. 5 was read regarding the points which the Siamese
                        government would undoubtedly raise at the Peace Conference. Mr. Lansing
                        observed that he agreed absolutely with the opinion of the American Chargé
                        d’Affaires at Bangkok as to the attitude which the United States should
                        maintain towards these points, but added that the British and French
                        governments would undoubtedly take a different point of view inasmuch as
                        they would accept territorial concessions in return for the modification of
                        their extraterritorial <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0056"/>privileges. He
                        further observed that these matters had nothing to do with the Peace Treaty
                        and that it looked as if everyone had the idea that the present Peace
                        Conference was a panacea for all evils.</p>

                    <p>1. Mr. Herter brought to the attention of the Commissioners the decision
                        which they had reached on February 4th,<note n="21" xml:id="d6fn21">See
                            minute 8, <ref target="#pg_16">p. 16</ref>.</note> in regard to the
                        present impossibility of rendering any assistance to Mr. Tredwell and Mr.
                        Kalamatiano in Russia, and then read a memorandum prepared by Dr. Lord
                        suggesting that the Bolsheviki be informed that <list>
                            <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                            <item>The American Government demands the immediate restoration of Mr.

                            <item>That it insists upon its demand of Dec. 7th with regard to Mr.

                            <item>That its future attitude towards the Soviets, particularly in the
                                conference to which an invitation has been issued, must be
                                materially influenced by the reply made to the present demands.
                                Failure to comply with them could only be taken by us as an
                                indication that the Soviets were minded neither to maintain justice
                                at home nor to respect the rules of international law, and we should
                                have to act accordingly.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing observed that Dr. Lord’s suggestions were very good but that he
                        did not see how they could possibly be conveyed to the Bolsheviki. The
                        invitation to the Prinkipo conference had not been issued to the Bolsheviki
                        alone, but to all factions in Russia, and the government of the United
                        States had never had any official communications either directly or through
                        a third power with the Bolsheviki. Mr. Lansing observed, however, that it
                        might be possible for the American delegates to the Prinkipo conference to
                        take up this question informally with the representatives of the Soviet
                        government, but that until that moment nothing could be done.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that no action should be taken at the present time in the
                        cases of Mr. Tredwell and Mr. Kalamatiano, but that this matter should be
                        brought to the attention of the American delegates who might be sent to the
                        proposed Prinkipo conference.</p>
                    <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0057"/>
                    <p>2. Memorandum No. 42 was read enclosing a draft of a telegram to the
                        Department of State at Washington regarding the granting of passports to the
                        representatives of the Department of Agriculture who desire to travel
                        abroad, and who may desire to enter the Central Empires before the final
                        conclusion of peace.</p>
                    <p>The draft of telegram attached to Memorandum No. 42 was approved.</p>
                    <p>3. Memorandum No. 43 was read, which again brought up the question of
                        increasing Mr. Sweetser’s salary as recommended in Memorandum No. 15 of
                        January 31, 1919.<note n="22" xml:id="d6fn22">See meeting of February 1,
                            minute 3, <ref target="#pg_7">p. 7</ref>.</note> There was also read a
                        note from Mr. Ray Stannard Baker explaining in detail the necessity for
                        increasing Mr. Sweetser’s salary. Mr. Lansing observed that in view of the
                        further explanations which had been furnished in this matter he would be
                        glad to see Mr. Sweetser’s salary raised to a figure amounting to the
                        equivalent of an army Captain’s salary plus the 40 francs a day subsistence
                        allowance which was allowed to officers attached to the Commission. Mr.
                        Herter undertook to determine the exact figures involved.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that Mr. Sweetser’s salary should be increased to the
                        equivalent of a Captain’s pay plus the equivalent of 40 francs per day.</p>
                    <p>4. Mr. Herter read Information Memorandum No. 6 as well as several extracts
                        from the French press to indicate the attitude which that press was taking
                        in regard to the President’s speech in the Chamber of Deputies and the
                        feelings of America generally.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing and Mr. White while expressing their indignation at the comments
                        of the French press felt that it would be inadvisable to attempt any
                        counteracting influence at the present time, that it would be better merely
                        to ignore the whole question.</p>
                    <p>5. Information Memorandum No. 7 was read indicating Mr. Horvath’s point of
                        view with regard to concluding an armistice with the Bolsheviks. Mr. Lansing
                        stated that he agreed heartily with the opinion expressed that the
                        Bolsheviks would undoubtedly violate the terms of any truce.</p>
                    <p>6. Memorandum No. 8 was read in regard to the views expressed in the <hi
                            rend="italic">Nichi Nichi</hi> on Japanese claims. Mr. Lansing observed
                        that the attitude of the Japanese was extremely disquieting, particularly in
                        its relation to China, and that he felt that this was the time for us to
                        have it out once and for all with Japan. Mr. White added that the Japanese
                        had undoubtedly viewed with great apprehension our tremendous war
                        preparations during the present war and of course if it came to a direct
                        issue between us Japan would be in a greatly inferior position because of
                        her relatively inferior economic and financial strength. Mr. Lansing stated
                        that this was absolutely true. He also stated that it was America’s duty to
                        support China.</p>
                    <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0058"/>
                    <p>7. Mr. Herter brought up again the question of Messrs. McCormick, Davis and
                        Baruch receiving the [minutes of the] secret meetings of the conferences at
                        the Quai d’Orsay, and stating that considerable ill feeling was being
                        aroused at the fact of their not being allowed to receive these minutes. Mr.
                        Lansing stated that the reason why the Commissioners had decided not to
                        deliver a copy of these minutes to the gentlemen in question was not because
                        of any mistrust or because of any desire that these gentlemen should not see
                        them, but because it was considered inadvisable to distribute more copies
                        than was absolutely necessary. He added however, that he had seen Mr.
                        McCormick on this point last night. He proposed that a compromise should be
                        reached by allowing Messrs. McCormick, Davis and Baruch to have one copy for
                        their use, but that it should be specified that this copy should not leave
                        the hotel and should be definitely charged to some responsible person in
                        their office.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that one copy of the [minutes of the] secret meetings of the
                        conference at the Quai d’Orsay should be distributed to one competent person
                        in the office of either Mr. Davis, Mr. Baruch or Mr. McCormick and that this
                        one copy should serve for the information of all three of these
                        gentlemen.</p>

                    <p>1. Memorandum No. 44 was read and it was decided that no further action
                        should be taken in regard to a decision previously arrived at, that American
                        troops should not be sent to Montenegro. Mr. Lansing felt that there was
                        further no necessity of sending American observers into Montenegro, and that
                        he preferred that nothing further be done in this whole matter until a
                        definite proposal came from either the Italian, Jugo-Slav or Montenegro
                        governments, all of which have a direct interest in this question whereas we
                        have only an indirect interest. Mr. Lansing also requested that Mr.
                            Davis<note n="23" xml:id="d7fn23">John W. Davis, Ambassador to Great
                            Britain.</note> in London be informed that we saw no reason at the
                        present time to change the decision which we had previously made in the
                        premises, as sufficient arguments had not been presented, but that beyond
                        that we should not commit ourselves.</p>
                    <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>3. Memorandum No. 46 was read and the Commissioners stated that they did not
                        consider it necessary to request General Kernan <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23"
                            facs="0059"/>and Mr. Lord to come to their meeting on Saturday Morning
                        inasmuch as both Mr. Lansing and Colonel House will see each of these
                        gentlemen separately before they go to Poland, and discuss the situation
                        with them. Furthermore beyond the instructions which have already been
                        issued to the whole Inter-Allied commission to Poland, the Commissioners had
                        no special instructions to give to our delegates.</p>
                    <p>4. Memorandum No. 47 was read and Mr. Baruch’s request for the immediate
                        assignment to duty in his office of the following officers <list>
                            <item>Captain John B. Dempsey</item>
                            <item>1st Lt. Ernest C. Dempsey</item>
                            <item>1st Lt. Ernest Angell</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">was approved. It was requested that the A. E. F. be notified
                        to assign these officers to the Commission.</p>
                    <p>5. Memorandum No. 48 was read and Dr. Mezes’ recommendation that Major J. N.
                        Merrill be assigned to the Commission for work in the Division of Western
                        Asia was approved. Mr. Lansing stated that he would be glad to approve
                        almost any recommendation for the assignment of useful individuals to the
                        Commission provided such assignment involved no added expense as in the case
                        in point.</p>
                    <p>6. Information Memorandum No. 9 was read; some of the conclusions drawn in
                        the last paragraph were not wholly approved of by the Commissioners. Both
                        Mr. White and Mr. Lansing felt that there were others besides the
                        missionaries who knew Siam as well as anyone, and were not in favor of the
                        relinquishing of extraterritorial jurisdiction. They further felt that as we
                        were in no position to ask for any <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi>, and
                        likewise did not approve of the principle of bargaining in a matter of this
                        nature, we should judge the question of relinquishing extraterritorial
                        jurisdiction in Siam from a purely objective point of view, and that
                        studying it in this light it was very doubtful whether it would be advisable
                        for us to renounce this privilege.</p>
                    <p>7. Memorandum No. 49 was read. The telegrams attached to this memorandum was
                            [<hi rend="italic">were</hi>] approved. The Commissioners felt, however,
                        that a paragraph should be added to the telegram to the Department of State
                        suggesting that the substance of the President’s second letter be conveyed
                        to the Legation of the Netherlands in Washington which is in charge of the
                        interests of Luxembourg in the United States. They believed, however, that
                        the wording of the President’s letter should be so paraphrased as to give
                        the impression that the delay which had occurred in the consideration of the
                        affairs of Luxembourg had been due to the fact that the associated
                        governments felt that this matter should be studied by them together in
                        connection with the Peace Conference, and that they could only take joint
                        action in the premises. At the same time such a message could be buttered
                            <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0060"/>up by a general expression of our
                        kindly and sympathetic feeling toward the people of Luxembourg.</p>
                    <p>8. Memorandum No. 50 was read. The Commissioners thought very strongly that
                        General McKinstry’s entire mission was a great waste of time and expense
                        inasmuch as at best the indemnity which Germany could pay could not possibly
                        satisfy all the demands of all of the associated governments. The
                        Commissioners felt that our only interest in the indemnity which Germany was
                        to pay was in the lump sum, and that the question of dividing this sum
                        between the associated governments was one in which we had no interest. They
                        therefore requested that a letter be drafted to the President placing this
                        matter before him in the light of their objections, and inquiring whether he
                        desired that General McKinstry continue with his investigations.</p>
                    <p>In the meanwhile the Commissioners were willing to abide by their decision of
                        January 28, 1919, but wished it clearly understood that if 40 francs per day
                        was to be allowed to the officers of General McKinstry’s staff a deduction
                        should be made for the subsistence paid by the army to its officers either
                        in Paris or in the Field. This amounts according to Mr. McNeir’s memorandum
                        to the equivalent of $39.80 for a 2nd Lieutenant up to $121.20 for a
                        Colonel.</p>

                    <p>1. General Bliss asked Mr. Lansing what conclusions had been reached by the
                        Committee consisting of the latter, Lord Milner and Mr. Tardieu, regarding
                        the question of German disarmament. Mr. Lansing replied that no definite
                        conclusion had been reached, and that the matter would be brought up for
                        reconsideration. He added that Lord Milner and he felt that the Committee
                        had practically reached a conclusion, but that later Mr. Tardieu expressed
                        the opinion that quite a different decision had been arrived at. Both Mr.
                        Lansing and Mr. Tardieu were in favor of cutting out of the proposed
                        schedule of arms, ammunition etc., which were to be required from the
                        Germans, everything except heavy guns, field guns and machine guns. Even in
                        the case of these guns, it was felt that the number proposed should be
                        reduced to about one half.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Tardieu proposed that the number of guns which the Germans should be
                        required to cede should be figured out on the basis of the normal armament
                        of 25 Infantry Divisions and 5 Cavalry Divisions, and that the Germans
                        should be allowed to retain only that number, turning over to the associated
                        governments all the rest. He added that this should be considered the
                        immediate minimum <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0061"/>which Germany
                        should be allowed to hold, but that later a final minimum should be decided
                        upon. Mr. Lansing was unable to see how this scheme was feasible, and said
                        that he could not consent to two separate minima being decided upon. In
                        spite of Mr. Lansing’s and Lord Milner’s objections, however, Mr. Tardieu
                        reported the conclusions of this Committee to his colleagues as having been
                        in accord with the original French proposal.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing believed that if this matter were to be taken up again by the
                        Supreme War Council, a proposal should be made that Germany should be asked
                        immediately the total number of guns and ammunition which she now had in her
                        possession. General Bliss agreed that this might be advisable, but felt that
                        it would be even better to send a mission into Germany to determine the
                        exact number. Mr. Lansing then stated that he thought Lord Milner was of the
                        opinion that if Allied experts were sent to Essen and Spandau to investigate
                        the war industries at those two centers it would be a sufficient precaution.
                        General Bliss agreed with this. He added, however, that the whole question
                        of requisitioning material from Germany was one of the most important
                        matters of policy which had come up for consideration. He felt that although
                        Germany might be in position to deliver much of the material which she now
                        possessed, public opinion in Germany would be so strongly opposed to such a
                        move that a new revolution might break out and the present comparatively
                        orderly government be overthrown. He further felt that if President Wilson
                        made it perfectly clear that if the terms of the armistice were broken he
                        would take absolutely no steps to interfere, the whole situation might be
                        cleared up.</p>
                    <p>2. Mr. White asked Mr. Lansing just what the trouble had been between M.
                        Clemenceau and Marshal Foch at the last meeting of the Peace Congress. Mr.
                        Lansing explained that the trouble had arisen because Clemenceau had accused
                        Foch of making too great concessions to the Germans at the Armistice
                        Commission in regard to the matter of mails. Marshal Foch became very much
                        excited over M. Clemenceau’s attitude and protested violently at the
                        criticism directed against him. He finally jumped to his feet and together
                        with his Chief of Staff left the meeting in great anger. While he was
                        leaving the room M. Clemenceau paid absolutely no attention to him and as
                        soon as the door was shut on his back continued the business of the day as
                        if nothing had happened. It was reported that Marshal Foch had waited for
                        many hours in the anteroom expecting to be summoned back to the meeting, but
                        that he waited in vain.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing felt that this incident has possibly assisted greatly in enabling
                        the American delegates to put through their proposal for a Supreme Economic
                        Council to control all matters in connection <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26"
                            facs="0062"/>with the Blockade of the Central Empires. He was sure that
                        Marshal Foch would never have approved of this scheme.</p>
                    <p>General Bliss said that it was his understanding that this Supreme Economic
                        Council would not be in a position to take direct action, but merely to make
                        recommendations. Mr. Lansing observed that General Bliss’ understanding in
                        this matter was correct. General Bliss then added that he was convinced that
                        if the associated governments relaxed the Blockade in respect to certain
                        essentials it would be very much easier to obtain from the German government
                        the fulfilment of certain conditions of the armistice. Mr. Lansing agreed
                        with General Bliss and stated that he had considered and was still
                        considering submitting a proposal in this sense to the Bureau of Ten.</p>
                    <p>3. Memorandum No. 52 was read regarding the bill which Dr. Herron had
                        submitted for his expense while in Paris. The Commissioners agreed that this
                        bill was extremely high but that the compromise, namely, for 1620 francs was
                        not exorbitant and should therefore be paid by the Commission.</p>
                    <p>In connection with Dr. Herron’s bill the telegram dated February 8th from the
                        State Department was read, quoting an article from the New York <hi
                            rend="italic">Sun</hi> about Prof. Herron. This caused considerable
                        amusement but the Commissioners felt that it was of sufficient importance to
                        be brought to the attention of the President immediately. It was expressed,
                        however, that in bringing the matter to the attention of the President no
                        mention should be made of the fact that it had been presented to the
                        Commissioners, but that the letter of transmission should be marked
                        “Important”.</p>
                    <p>4. The memorandum from Mr. Ray Stannard Baker dated February 7, 1919, was
                        read in regard to the action of the French government in not giving the
                        American press equal terms with the French press in the matter of the
                        message from the Russian government to the Allied powers. The Commissioners
                        felt much the same way as Mr. Baker did regarding this, but did not see how
                        they could take the question up with the French government.</p>
                    <p>5. The memorandum from Captain Tyler for General Churchill was read,
                        regarding the assignment of Lieut. Ludwell B. Alexander to the Peace
                        Commission. The Commissioners felt that in view of Lieut. Alexander’s
                        evident fitness for service with Prof. Coolidge, and the latter’s demand for
                        more men, it would be highly advisable to have him assigned to the
                        Commission at once.</p>
                    <p>6. Memorandum No. 53 was read regarding Mr. Baruch’s request for eight or ten
                        men as well as an allowance of $150,000. for the purpose of creating and
                        maintaining such an organization as he considered necessary. The
                        Commissioners were under the impression that an additional allotment had
                        already been requested from the President’s fund for the Peace Commission,
                        and that it was therefore now too late to <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27"
                            facs="0063"/>include Mr. Baruch’s request. They requested, however, that
                        this matter be straightened out through Mr. McNeir. At the same time the
                        Commissioners did not feel disposed to grant Mr. Baruch’s request except in
                        the matter of personnel which had already been approved by the President,
                        and that they much preferred that he take up the question of an allowance of
                        $150,000. with the President direct. They were not disposed to endorse this
                        request for this sum.</p>
                    <p>[7.] The question of Mr. Leon Dominian’s assignment to the Peace Commission
                        was brought up and the Commissioners were not quite clear as to the reasons
                        for desiring the assignment of Mr. Dominian to the Commission inasmuch as it
                        was their understanding that Mr. Barton and Mr. Howe were already on the
                        point of starting on a mission to Syria. They did not know that any other
                        mission was contemplated, and requested further information in the premises
                        before taking any final action.</p>
                    <p>8. Memorandum No. 54 was read and the Commissioners agreed that it would not
                        be well for the United States to interfere in the struggle between two
                        Montenegrin factions, and that therefore we had better take no action in
                        regard to the protests of the Royalist party in respect to the actions of
                        Serbian agents in Montenegro.</p>
                    <p>9. Memorandum No. 55 was read and the Commissioners took note of the
                        reference by the French government to the Treaty of London of April 26,
                            1915.<note n="24" xml:id="d8fn24">Great Britain, Cmd. 671, Misc. No. 7
                            (1920): <hi rend="italic">Agreement Between France, Russia, Great
                                Britain and Italy, Signed at London, April 26, 1915.</hi></note>
                        They agreed that no action should be taken with regard to this matter and
                        noted with great interest the reply of the French government to the Serbian
                        request.</p>
                    <p>10. Memorandum No. 56 regarding Count Sigray’s<note n="25" xml:id="d8fn25"
                            >Count Sigray had proposed to come to Paris as a representative of the
                            Karolyi government of Hungary.</note> desire to present his case to the
                        Peace Commissioners in Paris was read and the Commissioners agreed that it
                        would be impossible to make an exception in his case, stating that if he
                        were permitted to come to Paris representatives of German-Austria and
                        Germany would likewise have to be permitted the same privilege. They agreed
                        that a reply in this sense could be diplomatically conveyed to Count Sigray
                        through Mr. Hugh Wilson.</p>
                    <p>[11.] Mr. Herter asked the Commissioners’ opinion as to the advisability of
                        having a Diplomatic Secretary sent to Prinkipo together with the two
                        American Commissioners who have already been designated, recommending that
                        if this was approved in principle Mr. Livingston Phelps would be a most
                        appropriate man to send. The Commissioners agreed that it would be highly
                        advisable to have Mr. Phelps go to Prinkipo with Dr. Herron and Mr.
                            White,<note n="26" xml:id="d8fn26">George D. Herron and William Allen
                            White, selected to represent the United States at the Prinkipo
                            Conference.</note> and requested that a <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28"
                            facs="0064"/>telegram be drafted to the Department of State recommending
                        Mr. Phelps’ temporary assignment to this duty.</p>
                    <p>12. Mr. Herter again brought up the matter of payment for the visiting cards
                        of the personnel of the Commission. General Bliss stated that he had already
                        been asked to pay for his and had complied. He felt, and the Commissioners
                        agreed, that this was a very doubtful expense for the Commission to approve.
                        However, if this matter is causing considerable protests, they are willing
                        to reconsider their decision, but wish first to see a complete dossier of
                        all the protests which have been made.</p>
                    <p>13. Information Memorandum No. 9 was read in regard to the decision which the
                        Inter-Allied mission to Poland had reached in respect to the armistice
                        between the Poles and the Ukrainians. The Commissioners were very interested
                        in this matter, but were unable to figure out why Marshal Foch was unable to
                        interfere with General Berthelemy<note n="27" xml:id="d8fn27">Chief of the
                            Franco-British mission to Poland and Galicia.</note> as he had very
                        frequently interfered with him, and was in a position to issue any order to
                        him which he saw fit. They believed that there must be some answer to this
                        riddle and asked whether anyone felt competent to answer it. If so, they
                        will be glad to have the answer. The Commissioners commented on the
                        tremendous amount of intrigue now being carried on in Paris and all stated
                        that they wished that the Conference were meeting in Switzerland or
                        elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>14. Information Memorandum No. 10 was read in regard to the final disposition
                        of the Shantung Railway. The Commissioners noted the contents of this
                        memorandum with interest, but expressed no opinion with regard to the
                        solution which Minister Reinsch<note n="28" xml:id="d8fn28">Paul S. Reinsch,
                            Minister to China.</note> advocates.</p>

                    <p>1. Mr. McCormick stated that on behalf of his colleagues that the American
                        delegates on the Commission of Reparations were very anxious to learn the
                        opinion of the Commissioners in regard to certain broad general principles.
                        Briefs had been submitted to this Committee by each of the Delegations, and
                        it was found that very important differences existed between them. Mr.
                        McCormick wished to know whether the President’s 14 points should be adhered
                        to by the American delegation or whether in the computation of the sums
                        which Germany should be required to pay, the entire cost of the war was to
                        be considered. He wished to know how far the American delegates should fight
                        for the American point of view.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing felt that there were only three classes of claims; one, direct
                        damage to personal property; two, indirect damage, and three, the cost of
                        maintaining military establishments. To point one might be added the removal
                        of the people from, Belgium and France.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dulles stated that it would of course be impossible for the American
                        delegation to give a broad interpretation to the President’s 14 points. He
                        added that at the last meeting of the Commissioners, however, Mr. Hughes,
                        the first delegate for the British Empire had said that he did not see that
                        the President’s 14 points entered into this matter at all.</p>
                    <p>General Bliss expressed a wish that the whole question of the amount which
                        Germany was to pay should be settled once and for all in this small
                        Commission. He felt that it was very important for the United States to
                        learn whether, as a new principle, it could be admitted that the victorious
                        side could charge all the expense of maintaining its military organization
                        to the vanquished. He further felt that if this matter could not be settled
                        at once by the small Commission it should be referred to either a Plenary
                        Council or to the Bureau of Ten. Mr. McCormick observed that except for
                        ourselves, all the other nations felt that the cost of the war should be
                        included in the sum which Germany would be required to pay.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dulles stated that the question of reparations was a new question and
                        that the exact definition and formulation of this word was absolutely
                        necessary at the present time. General Bliss observed that in his opinion
                        reparations and indemnities were two separate things, but Mr. McCormick
                        added that all the other nations believed that under the head of
                        reparations, the cost of the war could be included. Mr. Baruch also stated
                        that according to Mr. Hughes, every form of payment came under the head of
                        reparation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. McCormick observed that as yet no reliable estimate had been made as to
                        the exact sum which Germany would be in a position to pay. He further said
                        that England, as well as the other nations directly concerned were [<hi
                            rend="italic">was</hi>] trying to put the blame on President Wilson for
                        reducing the claims of their respective countries.</p>
                    <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0066"/>
                    <p>General Bliss suggested that separate claims be studied by each of the
                        nations for reparation and for indemnity. Mr. McCormick [asked] whether, if
                        this were done, it would be necessary for the Committee on Reparations to
                        make out two separate reports, one a majority report on which all could
                        agree, in regard to reparations, and the second a minority report on which
                        the United States would state its dissent regarding indemnities. Mr. Baruch
                        observed that this was not possible because of the difference in
                        interpretation of the word reparations and indemnities. Mr. Baruch went on
                        to say that all the nations were now trying to put the United States in the
                        wrong. He suggested that inasmuch as there would not be sufficient money
                        coming from Germany to go all the way around, the American delegates merely
                        present their arguments but make no fight, and let the other nations
                        squabble between themselves as to the partition of the available funds.</p>
                    <p>Mr. McCormick felt that such a procedure might put the President in an
                        uncomfortable position as it would mean that in the first test case the
                        American delegates had backed down from one of the President’s 14
                        points.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dulles then inquired whether the funds now in the possession of the Alien
                        Property Custodian should be applicable for the satisfaction of the claims
                        which the United States has against Germany. He particularly wished the
                        opinion of the Commissioners on this point. He added that if we should pool
                        these funds with the rest of Germany’s assets for the satisfaction of the
                        claims of all the Allies it would make a difference in our attitude towards
                        our own claims. If we actually made the transfer, we would then have a
                        direct interest in the division of the spoils, whereas if we kept it as
                        security for our own claims we could then act entirely on principle in
                        regard to the settlement of other nations claims.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Strauss felt that it was very important that we should get the opinion of
                        the British in regard to these matters. He stated that they had a scheme for
                        securing the claims of their individual citizens. He also stated that our
                        Treasury believed that the United States could not confiscate the private
                        property of German citizens in the United States. He personally was not sure
                        whether it would be good policy to do this or not. If we compelled Germany
                        to settle with her own citizens in the United States in return for the
                        losses which they had sustained by our taking over all their property this
                        would amount to confiscation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Davis inquired whether other countries should be allowed any claim on the
                        German property which the United States holds. Mr. Strauss stated that
                        Jeremiah Smith, a Boston Lawyer and a Judge-Advocate of the Army was
                        studying this whole question and he proposed <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31"
                            facs="0067"/>that a diplomatic official should be assigned to study it
                        with him. Mr. Dulles was suggested for this job.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Davis then inquired whether the American delegates could not definitely
                        act on the basis that the American government was alone concerned with the
                        disposition of German property taken over by the Alien Property Custodian.
                        The Commissioners agreed that they could.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Strauss stated that he believed that we should not countenance the
                        confiscation of German property in the United States but that we should
                        certainly not part with it until the American claims were settled. Mr.
                        Lansing agreed that such a procedure would soon induce Germany to agree to
                        an equitable settlement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing asked if it would not be advisable to put up to the Supreme
                        Council the whole question of the definition of the word reparation. This
                        matter was discussed at some length and it was finally decided that it would
                        be best to have the President define this point and that then the American
                        delegates should act in accordance with his definition.</p>
                    <p>The question as to the attitude which the American delegates should adopt was
                        then discussed. Mr. McCormick felt very strongly that we should fight out
                        the whole question in accordance with the President’s 14 points, but of
                        course our fight would have to be qualified by any definition of the word
                        reparation which we could decide upon. Mr. Lansing felt that as Germany had
                        accepted the President’s 14 points this might be the wisest procedure, but
                        at the same time felt that we should not press our point of view too
                        strongly for fear of incurring the animosity of the French and British
                        people. He believed that we should first submit our claims, admit counter
                        claims and let the different nations fight out the division among
                        themselves. Mr. McCormick reiterated his belief that we should fight it out
                        on the basis of the President’s principles as this was the first real test
                        in the practical application of the accepted armistice terms. Mr. Davis
                        pointed out that the campaign which the other nations were carrying on with
                        a view to influencing the United States was in reality making their own
                        people believe that a much larger sum could be extorted from Germany than
                        was in any way possible. He added that the sooner these nations changed
                        their minds the better, as they would otherwise disappoint the expectations
                        of their people and get into a bad mess. He explained that Mr. Hughes
                        represented the point of view of the politicians in England who had been
                        forced to dwell on the question of tremendous reparations as a campaign
                        measure. He added that the Treasury officials of England felt much as we did
                        in this matter.</p>
                    <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0068"/>
                    <p>The question of priority of payment was then discussed. It was agreed that
                        this matter could only be settled after the lump sum which Germany would be
                        able to pay had been determined. Both Mr. Davis and Mr. McCormick felt the
                        tremendous importance of settling this matter at once. Mr. McCormick added
                        that in his opinion the preliminaries of peace could be signed as soon as
                        this figure had been determined.</p>
                    <p>In the discussions it developed that various nations had figured the sum
                        which Germany would be in position to pay anywhere from 120 billion down to
                        5 billion.</p>
                    <p>Everyone present agreed that it would be impossible to force Germany to
                        continue paying for a great number of years.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Baruch brought up the question of the guarantee which would be asked of
                        Germany to force her to pay the sum finally determined upon.</p>
                    <p>There was some question as to whether it was the duty of the Commission on
                        Reparations to determine this point or not, because no record could be found
                        that the suggestion made by Mr. Klotz at the second Plenary Session of the
                        Peace Conference had been approved.<note n="29" xml:id="d9fn29">See <ref

                                p. 200</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>Mr. Baruch recommended strongly that a report which he understood that the
                        Alien Property Custodian was about to submit to Congress, should be held up
                        until the question of reparations had been settled. He also recommended that
                        either Mr. A. Mitchell Palmer<note n="30" xml:id="d9fn30">Alien Property
                            Custodian.</note> or Mr. Bradley Palmer should be asked to come to Paris
                        to state their views in the premises.</p>
                    <p>The general decision arrived at in regard to the attitude which the United
                        States should adopt in the matters above discussed, was the following: The
                        American Delegates should submit their brief of claims to the Commission,
                        stating the basis on which these claims had been worked out and stating the
                        interpretation which the United States gives to the President’s principles
                        in regard to reparation. They should remain content with such a settlement
                        for the time being and not press our views too hard on the other
                        delegates.</p>
                    <p>It should be clearly stated that the disposition of the property held by the
                        Alien Property Custodian is a purely domestic affair and one in which no
                        other country has any direct concern.</p>

                    <p>1. The draft of telegram appended to Memorandum No. 57 was considered. The
                        Commissioners felt that proposal No. 1 was a little <pb n="33"
                            xml:id="pg_33" facs="0069"/>difficult to understand and that it would
                        perhaps be better for us not to commit ourselves on the question as to
                        whether the Prinkipo invitation involves an evacuation by the Soviet troops
                        of the Baltic provinces. In regard to point No. 2, the Commissioners felt
                        that it was going a little too far to state that the meeting at Prinkipo was
                        destined to provide for the settlement of just such problems as this. The
                        Commissioners further objected to calling the meeting at Prinkipo a
                        conference, feeling that too much dignity would be given this meeting by
                        honoring it with the title of conference.</p>
                    <p>The suggestion that the Minister at Stockholm should be advised that we would
                        be glad to have representatives from Latvia attend the meeting at Prinkipo
                        was approved.</p>
                    <p>2. A memorandum regarding Mr. Burgos, a delegate from Panama to the Peace
                        Conference was read, and it was agreed that Mr. White would see him as soon
                        as possible.</p>
                    <p>3. Memorandum No. 59 was read with a recommendation that Major de Lancey
                        Kountze be assigned to Mr. Dresel’s Division. This was approved.</p>
                    <p>4. Memorandum No. 60 was read and Mr. Lansing requested that all the facts
                        that are available in regard to the report that the French and British
                        governments were sending dye experts into Germany be compiled in the form of
                        a memorandum for him. The Commissioners felt that this was an extremely
                        important matter, and that if the facts as reported were found to be true, a
                        strong protest should be made by us. Mr. Lansing did not wish to decide,
                        however, from whom this protest should emanate until he had all the facts in
                        the premises before him.</p>
                    <p>5. Memorandum No. 61 was read. It was decided in regard to the question put
                        up in this memorandum that Mr. Beer should be authorized to keep the
                        Liberian delegation informed of such matters in connection with the German
                        cable controversy as might be in his discretion communicated to them without
                        prejudice to the interests involved or the further development of the
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>6. Memorandum No. 62 was read and it was decided that it was important to set
                        aside a time at which the Photographic Division of the Historical Branch of
                        the General Staff could take a photograph of the five Commissioners with the
                        heads of Departments and their assistants. It was requested, however, that
                        the President be immediately gotten in touch with to ascertain what time
                        would be the most convenient for him. This matter is considered very urgent
                        as the President’s stay in Paris is coming to an end.</p>
                    <p>7. Information Memorandum No. 11 was read and the Commissioners requested
                        that some member of the Secretariat be instructed <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34"
                            facs="0070"/>to ascertain discreetly from Mr. King<note n="31"
                            xml:id="d10fn31">C. D. B. King, of the Liberian delegation.</note> the
                        truth about the report that Mr. Dunbar<note n="32" xml:id="d10fn32">C. B.
                            Dunbar, of the Liberian delegation.</note> was a lawyer of the German
                        South American Telegraph Company.</p>
                    <p>8. Information Memorandum No. 12 was read and the Commissioners noted with
                        interest the statements contained in Mr. Page’s telegram. Previous to the
                        reading of this memorandum, however, Mr. Herter had read a telegram from The
                        Embassy at Rome dated February 8th which gave an entirely different attitude
                        in regard to the Franco-Italian relations. The Commissioners were much
                        amused by the apparent discrepancy in the conclusions reached.</p>
                    <p>9. Information Memorandum No. 13 was read and Mr. Lansing observed that he
                        had been told that this matter had been referred to Mr. McCormick, and that
                        he preferred that no action should be taken upon it by the Commissioners
                        until Mr. McCormick’s opinion in the premises had been heard.</p>
                    <p>10. Information Memorandum No. 14 was read, and was listened to with great
                        interest by the Commissioners. Their only comment was that Mr. Creel’s
                        statements was [<hi rend="italic">were</hi>] typical and ridiculous and that
                        it was absurd for Karolyi<note n="33" xml:id="d10fn33">Count Michael
                            Karolyi, President of the Hungarian Republic.</note> to expect the
                        United States to indicate what Hungarian Peace delegates would be
                        acceptable.</p>
                    <p>11. Information Memorandum No. 15 was read and the Commissioners expressed
                        surprise at the fact that there might be some agreements now in existence
                        between Japan and China of which the President of China had no knowledge.
                        They supposed that these must be agreements between the military authorities
                        of the two countries and that they would not be binding upon China as a
                        whole.</p>
                    <p>12. Information Memorandum No. 16 and Memorandum No. 63 was [<hi
                            rend="italic">were</hi>] read. The Commissioners felt very strongly that
                        both Captain Voska and Lieut. Voska should be immediately required to report
                        in Paris in regard to their activities. They suggested that a recommendation
                        in this sense be made to the competent officer of the A. E. F. in order that
                        these men may be immediately withdrawn from the territories of the former
                        Austro-Hungarian state and ordered to Paris.</p>
                    <p>14 [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. Information Memorandum No. 17 was read [and]
                        the Commissioners requested that Mr. Beer be instructed to ascertain whether
                        there were any funds available from any source whatever, whereby the
                        Liberian delegation could be assisted financially. Mr. Lansing felt that we
                        had absolutely no obligation in this matter, but that it would be well to
                        assist these gentlemen if possible. Mr. Lansing further asked for a report
                        on the solvency of the Liberian government in case it were decided advisable
                        to make them a small loan whereby they could finance their Peace
                        delegation.</p>
                    <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0071"/>
                    <p>15. Information Memorandum No. 18 was read and Mr. White stated that he would
                        be glad to append a written statement of the exact facts in the case for the
                        future guidance of anyone who might be interested in this matter.</p>
                    <p>16. Information Memorandum No. 19 was read and Mr. Lansing requested that no
                        action be taken in regard to Dr. Herron’s request for advice until he (Mr.
                        Lansing) had had an opportunity of speaking to the President about this
                        matter. Mr. Lansing added that he had himself sent to the President a copy
                        of the recent telegram received from the Department of State quoting an
                        article from the New York <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> about Dr. Herron.</p>

                    <p>1. A memorandum from Captain Tyler dated February 12, 1919, was read
                        regarding the confusion about the missions to Turkey and Syria. The
                        Commissioners regretted that there should have been a misunderstanding in
                        this matter, and expressed a wish that Mr. Dominian be requested to come to
                        the Peace Commission in Paris at once. They wished to reserve a decision,
                        however, about making Mr. Dominian head of a Commission to Turkey until he
                        had arrived here and the whole matter had been thoroughly thrashed out in
                        the light of what Mr. Barton and Mr. Howe have in the interval been able to
                        accomplish.</p>
                    <p>2. A memorandum from Captain Tyler regarding the assignment of Mr. Philip
                        Marshall Brown to the Peace Commission for service with Prof. Coolidge in
                        German-Austria or Hungary was discussed. The Commissioners approved Mr.
                        Brown’s assignment for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>3. The draft of a telegram which had been prepared in connection with
                        Memorandum No. 64 regarding the opinion of the Commission with regard to the
                        Prinkipo invitation and certain instructions that should be sent to the
                        Consul-General at Omsk was approved.</p>
                    <p>4. Memorandum No. 65 was read, and the Commissioners opinion was asked in
                        regard to the loan of $100,000,000. which the Czecho-Slovak Minister of
                        Foreign Affairs had requested. Mr. Dulles’ views <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36"
                            facs="0072"/>regarding this loan were explained, and the Commissioners
                        felt that it was not within their province to express any opinion, and that
                        all matters dealing with loans requested by foreign governments should be
                        sent to the Department of State for disposition. They did not approve the
                        recommendation that this request be sent to the President, but wished that
                        it be sent direct to the Department of State without comment.</p>
                    <p>5. The revised telegram regarding the Lettish-Prinkipo business was read and
                        highly approved.</p>
                    <p>6. Memorandum No. 66 was read and discussed. The Commissioners got rather
                        twisted up in regard to the fine distinction between the Inter-Allied
                        Aviation Conference and the Inter-Allied Aviation Committee. They had
                        absolutely no recollection of ever having considered this matter before,
                        except in connection with the question of sending representatives to the
                        Conference, in which case they had returned a negative decision, which they
                        found had been superseded by the action of the State Department in
                        appointing representatives. Paragraph 4 under heading No. 2 confused them
                        the most as they could not remember ever having expressed any views in the
                        premises and therefore requested that before going further in this matter
                        they would be glad to have it cleared up.</p>
                    <p>7. A letter to General McKinstry was read and highly approved by the
                        Commissioners.</p>
                    <p>8. Memorandum No. 67 was read in regard to the assignment of Captain Lester
                        W. Perrin to the Austro-Hungarian Division of the Peace Commission.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners observed that there was nothing in this memorandum to
                        indicate Captain Perrin’s qualifications for the position, and that before
                        rendering any decision in the premises they would prefer to have some
                        information in regard to his previous career and knowledge of
                        Austro-Hungarian matters. They expressed the opinion that all
                        recommendations for the attachment of new individuals to the Commission
                        should be studied purely from the point of view of the qualifications of the
                        individual and not from the point of view of the individual’s previous
                        friendship or association with a present member of the Commission.</p>
                    <p>9. Memorandum No. 68 was read, containing a recommendation that Captain
                        William Yale be assigned to work with the Division of Western Asia for a
                        period of six weeks, and that he be granted the official commutation during
                        this period, beginning with the morning of February 11th. This was
                        approved.</p>
                    <p>10. Memorandum No. 69 was read. The draft of the telegram embodying Mr.
                        McCormick’s views in regard to our submitting to the French government a
                        listed statement of the military expense of the United States since
                        mobilization was approved.</p>
                    <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0073"/>
                    <p>This decision of the Commissioners supersedes the decision which they
                        rendered on February 5th in regard to the same matter.<note n="34"
                            xml:id="d11fn34">See minute 2, <ref target="#pg_17">p.
                        17</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>11. Memorandum No. 70 was read. The question of the French Embassy in Berne
                        refusing to visa the passports of American officials returning from the
                        Central Empires without previous authorization from the French Foreign
                        Office was discussed. The Commissioners felt very strongly that this was an
                        absolutely unwarranted interference in the normal official duties of the
                        American Peace Commission, and that a severe protest should be made. They
                        believed that this protest should take the form of a letter to the American
                        Embassy in Paris with a request that a copy be submitted to the Foreign
                        Office. Mr. Lansing outlined approximately the statements which this letter
                        should contain as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>We should first state the case very clearly, and mention the repeated
                                efforts which we understand have been made to have the regulations
                                changed. We should then emphasize the fact that the unnecessary
                                delay entailed through this regulation is extremely serious and
                                appears to be an unnecessary hampering of the official business of
                                the American Peace Commission. We should then add that in view of
                                the seriousness of the matter we cannot but presume that the refusal
                                of the Foreign Office to make an exception in their regulation for
                                American officials is due to the attitude of some under official,
                                and could not possibly have received the consideration of Mr. Pichon
                                or whoever the highest official of the Foreign Office is.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>12. The draft of a telegram attached to Memorandum No. 71 regarding the
                        attitude which we should assume towards the new states in the process of
                        formation within the Central Empires as regarded matters of trade,
                        passports, naturalization, mail censorship etc., was approved.</p>
                    <p>13. Memorandum No. 72 was read and it was decided that Mr. Gompers’ request
                        for two Cadillac limousines from the Commission’s pool to be placed at his
                        disposal to go to Brussels on Friday should be refused.</p>
                    <p>14. Memorandum No. 73 containing the application of Mr. Ray Stannard Baker
                        for a temporary leave of absence was considered and approved. In this
                        connection the Commissioners felt that Mr. Sweet-ser would be absolutely
                        competent to carry on Mr. Baker’s work, and in view of the responsibilities
                        which would be imposed upon him, their previous decision in regard to his
                        salary should not hold. At Mr. Lansing’s suggestion, they approved of his
                        receiving $300 per month plus the equivalent of the subsistence allowance of
                        40 francs a day, which would total $540 per month. This salary shall
                        continue at least during the time which Mr. Sweetser is in charge, and
                        probably after Mr. Baker’s return.</p>
                    <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0074"/>
                    <p>15. Memorandum No. 74 was read. It was decided that none of the Commissioners
                        should accompany the President to Brest, and that it would not be necessary
                        for any member of the Secretariat to accompany him either.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>1. General Bliss stated that General de Goutte had come to him on behalf of
                        Marshal Foch to discuss the terms of the new armistice conditions. General
                        Bliss had received the impression that the French wished to reduce the
                        German army to absolutely nothing at all, and that this was rather a
                        dangerous move. He felt that Marshal Foch would not really take the same
                        view as that expressed by General de Goutte. Mr. Lansing agreed with General
                        Bliss that there would be grave danger of having hostilities renewed if we
                        pressed Germany too hard and that this would be extremely bad policy.
                        General Bliss added in this connection that at the present time the American
                        army was the only army in condition to fight, and that if hostilities were
                        renewed the entire burden would fall on us.</p>
                    <p>2. Mr. White read an article which appeared in this morning’s Paris <hi
                            rend="italic">Herald</hi> quoting certain remarks made by the President
                        at an interview which he held yesterday with the American Press. Mr. White
                        explained that the American Press was extremely angry about this interview,
                        feeling that it was an absolute breach of faith. Mr. Hood of the Associated
                        Press had recommended to Mr. White that immediate action be taken in this
                        matter, and that the violator be very severely dealt with.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners agreed that Mr. White should, at the meeting with the Press
                        this morning take up the matter and ascertain who the individual was who
                        violated the President’s confidence. He should then ask for a report by the
                        Press Committee at [<hi rend="italic">as to?</hi>] the nature of the
                        punishment which should be meted out to the offender.</p>
                    <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0075"/>
                    <p>3. Mr. Lansing stated that the time had now come when we should send
                        Diplomatic agents to the Czecho-Slovak Republic and to Poland. He suggested
                        that Mr. Hugh Gibson be sent to Prague and Mr. W. H. Buckler to Poland. He
                        asked that these gentlemen be notified of their appointment and that this be
                        effected through a letter which he would sign by authority of the President.
                        General Bliss inquired what staffs these gentlemen should take with them,
                        suggesting that if military agents were considered necessary, he was
                        convinced that there were several very good men available. It was agreed
                        that this whole question should be referred to Mr. Grew and that his report
                        in the premises would be acceptable to the Commissioners.</p>
                    <p>4. The question of the transportation of troops and supplies across Holland
                        was discussed. Mr. Lansing stated that he had received a telegram from The
                        Hague stating that the Dutch government had approved General Pershing’s
                        scheme for sending supplies through Holland. General Bliss explained that
                        this proposal did not involve the sending of men through Holland as no real
                        base was to be established. It would merely be a small number of supervising
                        personnel to direct the trans-shipment of cargoes which were landed at
                        Rotterdam. The whole proceeding would be analogous to any commercial
                        transaction.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing stated that he had received a draft of a note which it was
                        proposed should be sent by the five Great Powers to Holland urging that the
                        Dutch government permit the passage of British troops through its territory.
                        It was explained that the British earnestly desired this privilege because
                        of the fact that practically the entire British army of occupation would
                        have to be replaced by volunteer troops in accordance with the scheme lately
                        laid down by the British government. If this permission were accorded, it
                        would of course be a breach of Holland’s neutrality, but then as Holland had
                        already agreed in principle to General Pershing’s proposal, which in itself
                        involved a breach of neutrality, the British scheme would really come in the
                        same category. The Commissioners agreed that we should approve the note to
                        Holland as it would undoubtedly give Holland a more secure feeling if the
                        request had been made by all the great Powers rather than only two or
                        three.</p>
                    <p>5. Mr. White mentioned the fact that the President had some time ago received
                        a personal letter from the Queen of Holland, inviting him to come to
                        Holland, and that up till the time of his departure he had left this letter
                        unanswered in spite of its having been called to his attention several times
                        by both Mr. White and Mr. Lansing. In fact Mr. Loudon, the former Dutch
                        Minister of Foreign Affairs of Holland had been waiting in Paris some time
                        to receive this reply, and was undoubtedly feeling much disappointed because
                        of his failure. Mr. Lansing observed that matters of this sort should be
                        attended to very <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0076"/>promptly, and that
                        if only the President had an active Diplomatic Secretary such mistakes would
                        not occur. He asked Mr. Herter to see that a wireless message was
                        immediately prepared for the President urging him to immediately answer the
                        invitation in question.</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="smallcaps">Note</hi>) Mr. Herter has since ascertained that the
                        President has replied to the Queen of Holland’s invitation by telegram, and
                        that it is therefore unnecessary to take any further action in the
                        premises.</p>
                    <p>6. Memorandum No. 75 was read in regard to Rear Admiral Bristol’s<note n="35"
                            xml:id="d12fn35">Mark L. Bristol, commanding the United States naval
                            forces in Turkey.</note> desire to make use of the American Embassy at
                        Constantinople and his desire to coordinate the work of all the agencies of
                        the American government at Constantinople under his supervision. It was
                        pointed out that Mr. Heck was American Commissioner to Constantinople, and
                        that undoubtedly this request of Admiral Bristol’s was based on some
                        division of authority which might perhaps have caused trouble. The
                        Commissioners desired to ascertain exactly what sort of a commissioner Mr.
                        Heck was, and the details of his appointment. At the same time they felt
                        that the recommendations on this memorandum were not wise, and that they
                        would like to review it in the light of any information which would be
                        obtained in regard to Mr. Heck’s appointment.</p>
                    <p>7. Memorandum No. 76 was read. The desire of the Esthonian Delegation in
                        Paris to have Esthonia recognized an independent state, and the statement of
                        that Delegation that it would not consider itself bound by any decision that
                        should be taken at the Prinkipo investigation with regard to its
                        independence was considered. The draft of the telegram to the Department of
                        State in this connection indicating that the Commissioners did not have
                        sufficient information upon which to base any decision was approved.<note

                    <p>8. Memorandum No. 77 was read. The request of the President of the Lithuanian
                        Delegation in Paris regarding the independence of Lithuania and the mission
                        of its representatives to the Peace Conference was considered. The
                        Commissioners felt that with the incomplete information at their disposal,
                        they would be unwilling to take any action in the premises, and therefore
                        approved the draft of the telegram attached to this memorandum.<note n="37"

                    <p>9. Memorandum No. 78 was read. The new bulletin issued by the office of the
                            Secretary<note n="38" xml:id="d12fn38">Usually referred to as the
                            “SH–Bulletin.”</note> was brought to their attention. The Commissioners
                        observed that although this bulletin had not previously been brought to
                        their attention, they considered it an excellent idea and that in future
                        they would watch its contents with great care and <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41"
                            facs="0077"/>from time to time inform the Secretariat of such additions
                        as they might consider advisable.</p>
                    <p>10. Memorandum No. 79 was read. It was explained that Mr. Grew had taken the
                        responsibility of allowing Mr. Gompers to have two automobiles for his trip
                        to Brussels this week end in spite of the decision of the Commissioners on
                        Memorandum No. 72. In view of the facts presented, the Commissioners highly
                        approved Mr. Grew’s decision in the premises.</p>
                    <p>11. Memorandum No. 80 was read. The proposal of the French government that
                        the agricultural machinery to be required of Germany should be divided
                        between France and Belgium in a proportion of ⅘ to France and ⅕ to Belgium
                        was considered. The Commissioners felt that they were not in any position to
                        render a decision in this matter and rather doubt whether it is a question
                        that the United States should pass on at all. In making a decision one way
                        or another they felt that we would merely be borrowing trouble. They
                        suggested that we telegraph to the Department of State indicating that we
                        had no facts on which to render a decision and that we presumed that
                        Washington had none either.</p>
                    <p>12. Memorandum No. 81. Mr. Herter brought up the recommendation made by
                        Messrs. Baruch, Davis and McCormick as stated in Memorandum No. 81 in regard
                        to the Secretary of the Reparation Committee, Mr. Jerome D. Greene. The
                        Commissioners stated that as they did not know Mr. Greene they were unable
                        to make a fair decision in the premises. Mr. Lansing, however, stated that
                        he thought it very essential that a Diplomatic Secretary should be attached
                        to the Reparation Commission but would be very glad to discuss this matter
                        with Mr. Baruch or Mr. McCormick in order to ascertain just what Mr.
                        Greene’s qualifications for the position are. The Commissioners were,
                        however, definite in disapproving the suggestion that the Secretaries of
                        Committees and sub-committees should be allowed to act as heads of little
                        bureaus of their own, but that when they wish to ask for supplies or
                        assistants, they should do so through their chiefs.</p>
                    <p>13. Mr. Herter read a letter addressed to Mr. Grew by Mr. Beer in regard to
                        the financing of the Liberian Peace Delegation. The Commissioners felt that
                        it would be impossible to finance this mission from the funds at the
                        disposal of the Peace Commission but that it might be possible for the
                        Liberian delegates to obtain a private loan which would be secured by the
                        expectations of eventually receiving an advance of 5 million dollars in
                        accordance with American plan of November 19, 1918.<note n="39"

                    <p>14. Mr. Herter brought up for consideration the possible assignment of
                        Messrs. Bundy and Chesbrough to the Commission, to be <pb n="42"
                            xml:id="pg_42" facs="0078"/>utilized on an expedition which is planned
                        for Turkey. The Commissioners felt that pending the arrival of Mr. Dominian,
                        and in view of the possible return to the United States of the two above
                        mentioned gentlemen, it would be well to have them come to Paris as soon as
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>15. Mr. Herter again brought up the question of having American
                        representatives serve on the Inter-Allied Aviation Committee in the light of
                        an explanation which Mr. Grew furnished. The Commissioners felt that they
                        were not in a position to decide this matter outright, but they would be
                        glad if it could be submitted to General Bliss for his careful study and
                        consideration. They will then be glad to abide by any decision that he may
                        make in the premises.</p>
                    <p>16. Mr. Herter read the President’s letter in regard to Prof. Herron’s
                        appointment and the Commissioners felt that it would be advisable to have
                        Prof. Herron come to Paris at once. At the same time Mr. Herter took up with
                        them a memorandum which General Bliss had given him regarding the sending of
                        some financial expert to Prinkipo with the American delegates. The
                        Commissioners requested that Mr. Davis be consulted in regard to Mr.
                        Crosby’s recommendation in that memorandum, and be asked if he approved to
                        name the expert who would be available to go on this mission. At the same
                        time they requested that the matter be brought to the attention of Mr. White
                        and Prof. Herron in order that it might not seem as if the Commission were
                        trying to add members to their party whom they did not wish to take.</p>
                    <p>17. Memorandum No. 83 was read and the Commissioners asked whether Minister
                            Caldwell<note n="40" xml:id="d12fn40">J. L. Caldwell, Minister to
                            Persia.</note> had any connection with the Peace Commission. They stated
                        so far as they were aware he had absolutely no connection with the
                        Commission, and that we were under no obligation whatever to furnish him
                        with motor transportation.</p>

                    <p>1. Colonel House brought up for discussion the question of the attitude which
                        the American delegates should assume at the meeting this afternoon at the
                        Quai d’Orsay in regard to the Russian situation. …</p>
                    <p>A draft outline of our policy in respect to the matter under consideration
                        was considered by the Commissioners. This outline had been prepared by Mr.
                        Auchincloss. The points contained therein were discussed one by one.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners agreed that in any statement which was to be issued we
                        should be frank in stating that negotiations with Russia had not been broken
                        off but that certain groups in Russia had not complied with the conditions
                        contained in the original proposal of the associated governments. Mr.
                        Lansing felt that it should be made clear that because of the
                        misinterpretation of our offer by the Bolsheviks, a further statement was
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners agreed that we should reiterate our statement that we did
                        not wish to interfere in the internal affairs of Russia and that the motives
                        which had actuated our first proposal had nothing to do with foreign loans
                        or concessions in territory, but that our only wish was to be of service to
                        Russia in relieving her distress. Colonel House observed that he had been
                        convinced by conversation which he had had with Mr. Branting last night that
                        it would be extremely important for us to express ourselves in favor of
                        peasant proprietorship in Russia. The Commissioners agreed that it would be
                        advisable to do so. Mr. Lansing added that our only real hope for stability
                        in Russia lay in recognizing the benefits of the redistribution of land. It
                        was decided that this statement should be made very clearly even though the
                        British might object because of the great land problem in England.</p>
                    <p>Colonel House felt that we should make it clear that in case the various
                        factions in Russia were willing to meet us half way we would be glad to help
                        with food and raw materials, but at the same time we should state that no
                        effort had been made by certain leaders of groups to meet our invitation in
                        the spirit in which it was dictated.</p>
                    <p>Colonel House stated that we should say that we intended to offer every
                        assistance to contiguous countries, in order to help them in the peaceful
                        pursuit of their lives. The wording of this thought was discussed and Mr.
                        Lansing’s proposal that “by every means in our power” should be inserted was
                        approved.</p>
                    <p>Colonel House felt that in any statement of our policy we should be sure to
                        add that we were at any time ready to negotiate with the various factions in
                        Russia collectively for a peaceful settlement provided they accepted our
                        original proposal to cease hostilities prior to any discussions. The
                        Commissioners agreed that such a statement should be made.</p>
                    <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0080"/>
                    <p>Mr. Herter was requested to consult with Mr. Auchincloss regarding a redraft
                        of the outline which Colonel House had submitted.</p>
                    <p>2. General Bliss stated that we should be entirely prepared with an answer in
                        case we were faced by the question of using armed force in Russia. He then
                        read an opinion which he had prepared, and which he asked the other
                        Commissioners to comment upon. This read as follows: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“It is quite certain—and it will be the part of wisdom for all of us
                                to take note of the fact—that the Government and the people of the
                                United States will be radically opposed to taking part in any
                                hostile action in Russia so long as the present general conditions
                                elsewhere continue to exist. That Government and people will not
                                engage in a new war of unknown extent and duration until the present
                                war is ended by a declared and settled peace.</p>
                            <p>One reason of the American indisposition to take positive action with
                                the respect to the situation in Russia is their inability to focus
                                their undivided attention on Russia so as to enable them to realize
                                what is going on there and what it may mean to the peace of the
                                world.</p>
                            <p>To them, Bolshevism in Russia is one of the many confused blotches
                                which disfigure the map of Europe. To them, everything here seems in
                                an intolerable confusion, Russia no more than some other States.</p>
                            <p>If we could make final and definitive peace <hi rend="italic">at
                                    once</hi>; if we could say to Germany and Poland and
                                Czecho-Slovakia and other States, ‘These are your definitive
                                boundaries, stay inside of them and stop fighting your neighbors and
                                trying to acquire their territory by force’; if we could now
                                accomplish that, thereby bringing that part of Europe into the first
                                stages of an orderly peace which is praying for that peace, then the
                                conditions of Russia would stand out in clear and glaring relief
                                from this general level of peace. Then, and then only, the people of
                                the United States might come to see that peace in Russia is the only
                                thing necessary to secure universal peace; that her present
                                condition is the only thing that menaces the peace of the world. It
                                is possible that then the United States might be willing to take a
                                part in the pacification of Russia. But it is certain that it will
                                not lift a hand to do this so long as we maintain the state of war
                                with the Central Powers; so long as we continue to dispute not with
                                Germany but among ourselves—about the terms of peace that we will
                                impose on Germany; and so long as the United States sees each day
                                bringing us nearer to a possible resumption of hostilities.</p>
                            <p>Finally, it is worth noting that the resumption of a state of peace
                                elsewhere in Europe may, directly or indirectly, go a long way of
                                itself in removing or diminishing the menace of Bolshevism. The
                                latter lives and thrives in the murky waters of confusion and strife
                                that still engulf Europe. When it shall stand out in the full view
                                of the United States and of all the world without their attention
                                and scrutiny being diverted by many other evils in many other places
                                Bolshevism, like other disease-breeding microbes, will be weakened
                                and perhaps die in the light.[”]</p>

                    <p>The Commissioners agreed heartily with General Bliss’s statement of our
                        policy, and decided that it should be read at this afternoon’s meeting as a
                        preliminary to suggesting that a statement should be <pb n="45"
                            xml:id="pg_45" facs="0081"/>made by all the associated governments in
                        the sense of the outline which Colonel House had submitted at the beginning
                        of the meeting. The Commissioners felt that in case the French tried, as had
                        been done in previous cases, to publish some statement to the effect that
                        all the governments were agreed on a policy toward Russia, and that this
                        policy was armed intervention, we should then immediately counter by giving
                        to the press the statement which General Bliss had just read. The
                        Commissioners further felt that by reading the statement in question at the
                        meeting this afternoon Mr. Churchill’s proposal of referring the matter to a
                        military commission to study the whole question would of itself fall
                        through.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners then discussed the present position of our armies in
                        Russia. General Bliss explained that the expeditions to both Murmansk and
                        Vladivostok had been motivated because of the threatened seizure of Allied
                        supplies by the Germans or factions of Russia friendly to the Germans, or
                        because of threatened famine in Russia. He added that our neutrality laws
                        absolutely prevented our fighting Russia without the consent of Congress. He
                        also stated that a telegram had been sent to the Secretary of War asking him
                        to explain to the Military Committees of the Senate and the House that the
                        two companies of Railroad engineers which had been sent to assist our forces
                        in Archangel had been sent to assist these not in aggressive action toward
                        Russia but in order to facilitate their withdrawal from Russia as soon as
                        weather conditions permitted. He pointed out that this withdrawal was not
                        possible until next Spring, and that in any case we should not desert the
                        forces of the associated governments which are collaborating with us in that
                        region. He added that this was a time to make a definite statement of our
                        policy in regard to the withdrawal of these forces and that he was sure that
                        England would agree with us as a nation …</p>
                    <p>3. Colonel House observed that Mr. Balfour appeared much worried about a
                        situation which had arisen in regard to the indemnity question. America was
                        now advocating one view whereas all the other associated nations were
                        advocating another view. At present the Committee on Reparations had divided
                        into three classes, the first class was one whose duty it was to determine
                        how much Germany should pay. In this section there had been the most
                        trouble. Mr. Balfour had told Colonel House that he would urge on his
                        colleagues to soft-pedal further discussion in this section and to put all
                        their energies in section No. 2 whose duty it is to determine what Germany
                        can pay. Colonel House added that Sir William Wiseman had suggested that if
                        this procedure was not accepted by the British delegates we might suggest
                        that the discussion in Section No. 1 had reached an impasse upon a question
                        of a political nature and it would therefore be well to refer that question
                        to the Bureau of Ten. New men would undoubtedly be <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46"
                            facs="0082"/>chosen on behalf of Great Britain to reconsider the matter.
                        Sir George [omission] was being suggested as the most likely candidate.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing observed that he had told both the Belgian Prime Minister and Mr.
                        Hugues Leroux, a friend of Mr. Pichon, how foolish both France and Belgium
                        were to support the British point of view in regard to indemnities. He felt
                        that both of these gentlemen agreed with him in this matter.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners all had the feeling that France and Belgium were going
                        against their own interests in this whole question but that as matters were
                        now developing it would seem as if the United States could eventually be
                        expected to pay for all.</p>
                    <p>4. Mr. Lansing read a memorandum which he had prepared incorporating the
                        points which he believed should be inserted in the preliminaries of peace.

                    <p>Mr. Lansing in commenting on this memorandum expressed the belief that it
                        should be shorter. General Bliss added that he could furnish Mr. Lansing
                        with the American draft proposal in regard to the military and naval terms
                        to which Germany should submit.</p>
                    <p>Colonel House withdrew.</p>
                    <p>5. Mr. Lansing spoke of a complaint which had been made by the French in
                        regard to the United States negotiating with Holland with respect to the
                        passage of supplies and troops through the port of Rotterdam. In the
                        discussion of this question it was found that an agreement had already been
                        reached upon it at the meeting at the Quai d’Orsay on Saturday, February 15,
                            1919,<note n="41" xml:id="d13fn41">See BC–33, minute 2, <ref

                                5</ref>.</note> at which time it was agreed that the five Powers
                        should take joint action in the premises sending an identical note to the
                        Dutch government.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Grew, Mr. Dresel and Captain Gherardi entered the meeting.</p>
                    <p>6. Captain Gherardi who had just returned from Germany was asked to give his
                        opinion in regard to the situation in that country. <pb n="47"
                            xml:id="pg_47" facs="0083"/>He stated that the present government of
                        Germany was struggling against a great opposition and was unfortunately not
                        supported by a majority vote of the majority Socialists. It had had to
                        compromise with the Democratic party in which were several members from the
                        old Pan-German crowd. Among those was Count Bernstorff who is playing an
                        extremely important part both in the Foreign Office and at Weimar. This was
                        probably due partly to his aggressive ability and partly because he was a
                        relation of Count Von Brockdorff-Rantzau. The latter will undoubtedly head
                        the German Peace Commission. In the government itself, Ebert could be
                        considered as honest and sincere. Noske is probably the strongest man,
                        whereas Scheidemann although much of a politician was really interested with
                        the rest of the majority socialists in earnest reforms throughout Germany.
                        According to Captain Gherardi, the press in Germany was still being
                        controlled by the government, and was now bending its efforts in line with
                        the desires of the Democratic party to arouse in the German people a
                        sentiment for the necessity of having the German colonies returned, and the
                        former territorial boundaries of Germany left unchanged. Captain Gherardi
                        felt, however, that at present the coalition government in Germany should be
                        maintained, and that the best way in which we could render desistance [<hi
                            rend="italic">assistance</hi>] was by sending in food and raw
                        material.</p>
                    <p>Commenting on the Bolshevik situation in Germany, Captain Gherardi stated
                        that through the efforts of Radek and certain members of the Spartacus
                        group, the government had managed to keep this movement pretty well in hand.
                        At one time, however, the government had been unable to depend on a single
                        soldier in Berlin, but at the present time there are several regiments of
                        highly paid volunteers who are considered loyal, and who are maintaining
                        order.</p>
                    <p>Captain Gherardi observed that the Commission of which he had been the head
                        had been considerably hampered by the fact that most of its members were
                        officers in uniform. Any officer in uniform was now an object of suspicion
                        in Germany and it was therefore difficult for them to gather much
                        information. A plot had been discovered directed against Captain Gherardi’s
                        life. He was therefore continually under the guard of Foreign Office
                        detectives. The Foreign Office felt that this plot had probably been
                        engineered by enemies of the government as a political move to cause the
                        United States to get into difficulties with the present German
                        government.</p>
                    <p>Captain Gherardi felt that the best way of getting information from Germany
                        at the present time was by sending traveling commissions of experts who
                        should stay in Germany for only a short time, and then report direct to the
                        Peace Commission. He felt that his men had better be reduced to a small
                        number of prominent members <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0084"/>who would
                        stay in Berlin and who would preferably be civilians. He suggested that it
                        would be advisable to have the military personnel withdrawn by degrees.</p>
                    <p>In reply to a question from Mr. Lansing as to the make-up of his Commission
                        Captain Gherardi replied that he had 14 officers and 2 civilians as well as
                        a navy communication party with him in Berlin. Two officers he had sent to
                        Hamburg and Bremen, whereas [<hi rend="italic">where?</hi>] one officer was
                        studying the unemployment situation, and one the canal and railway
                        conditions. This latter information was particularly valuable for Mr.
                        Hoover’s representatives. One civilian was constantly at Weimar and another
                        civilian, though not a member of the Commission, had been traveling every
                        week from Weimar to Berlin to report on the political situation in the
                        former city.</p>
                    <p>Captain Gherardi observed that the feeling against [<hi rend="italic"
                            >toward?</hi>] the American officers was not too friendly. He added that
                        when he had first arrived in Berlin Count Von Brockdorff-Rantzau had asked
                        him if he would not submit the reports that would be sent to the American
                        government through the Foreign Office for correction and verification. This
                        he naturally refused to do.</p>
                    <p>Captain Gherardi informed the Commissioners that the German government
                        already had a large amount of material prepared for the time when they
                        should be admitted to the Peace Conference. Dr. Taylor had collected some of
                        this material. They had even gone so far as to compute the damage caused by
                        the blockade in monetary values, and that this computation would form a base
                        for a claim of reparation.</p>
                    <p>In Captain Gherardi’s opinion the proposed constitution in Germany was quite
                        imperialistic. The President can convoke and dissolve the assembly. A clause
                        proposing the abolition of all secret treaties had been voted down etc.</p>
                    <p>Very few people in Germany want the Kaiser back, although a few members of
                        the clergy and school teachers who were very content under the old regime
                        probably wished to have it revived. The danger at the present moment comes
                        from the left and not from the right. The country is in a steady flux. The
                        shell is off and the whole body is rather soft. There is, however, a genuine
                        wish for democracy.</p>
                    <p>General Bliss inquired whether Captain Gherardi had any information in regard
                        to the continuing of work in the munition plants. The latter replied that
                        the only information he had in this respect came from some city on the North
                        Sea where it was reported that an old factory was now manufacturing bombs to
                        supply the Bolsheviks in their next uprising. Captain Gherardi also stated
                        that there were many applications from German officers for positions in the
                        American army.</p>
                    <p>After a brief further discussion on present plans for helping Russian
                        prisoners of war in Germany, the Commissioners agreed that <pb n="49"
                            xml:id="pg_49" facs="0085"/>Captain Gherardi should be relieved of his
                        present duties and allowed to resume his service at sea. They also decided
                        that the military members of his Commission should be gradually withdrawn
                        from Germany and that special missions should be sent to Germany from time
                        to time for the purpose of obtaining first hand information. It was felt
                        that Mr. Day at least should remain permanently in Berlin but that if
                        possible an older man should be sent to act as his superior, if not in
                        practice, at least in name.</p>

                    <p>1. Mr. Lansing stated that at the meeting at the Quai d’Orsay yesterday a
                        solution in the Russian matter had not progressed very far.<note n="42"
                            xml:id="d14fn42">See BC–34, minute 7, <ref
                                target="frus1919Parisv04#pg_28">vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">iv</hi>,
                                p. 28</ref>.</note> General Bliss observed that he was to meet
                        General Wilson and the military leaders of certain other powers today in a
                        conference on the whole subject. He would then read the memorandum which he
                        had prepared yesterday, and would state clearly that in his opinion, from a
                        military point of view it would be a piece of criminal folly to start
                        another war on the other side of Germany until the present war had finished.
                        He felt very strongly that the Bureau of Ten should decide the policy which
                        was to be pursued in Russia and that then the military leaders should devise
                        as to how this policy could be carried out. Evidently Winston Churchill
                        wished to put the brunt of deciding a policy on the military leaders.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing stated that in view of the fact that the Bureau of Ten had not
                        been able to decide on any policy, it would be best for General Bliss to
                        work purely on a hypothetic basis. This General Bliss agreed to do, and
                        added that he would propose that certain hypothetic solutions be considered,
                        and that then the military leaders work out different methods of pursuing
                        these assumed policies.</p>
                    <p>2. Mr. Herter suggested that Mr. Fred Dolbeare, who is in charge of the
                        active correspondence on Russian affairs, be allowed to attend the meetings
                        at the Quai d’Orsay as a technical advisor when such affairs were being
                        discussed. The Commissioners agreed that it would <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50"
                            facs="0086"/>be most advisable for Mr. Dolbeare to attend these meetings
                        when such affairs were the topic of discussion.</p>
                    <p>[3.] The question of the members of certain Albanian factions having been
                        refused passports to proceed to Paris to present their claims was discussed.
                        The Commissioners felt very strongly that the Italians and French were
                        pursuing this policy of keeping from Paris persons of unsympathetic views
                        too far. They requested therefore that a note be drafted to the American
                        Embassy in Paris stating that the Commissioners felt that with a view to
                        getting all sides of the Albanian question it would be most advisable to
                        have Messrs. Tourtoulis and Midhat Bey Frasheri come to Paris at once. The
                        Embassy should then bring to the attention of the French government the
                        attitude of the American Commission to Negotiate Peace in this matter with a
                        request that favorable consideration be given to the above named gentlemen’s
                        applications to proceed to Paris.</p>
                    <p>4. Memorandum No. 85 was read. The draft of telegram attached to this
                        memorandum regarding the question of the recognition of the Rumanian
                        Minister to the United States was discussed. The Commissioners agreed that
                        unless for some personal objections, the Rumanian Minister to Washington
                        should be recognized, and therefore approved the telegram in question.</p>
                    <p>5. Memorandum No. 86 was read and the Commissioners considered the question
                        of the movement which was probably being supported by both Hungary and Italy
                        toward the formation of an autonomy state in Croatia. They agreed that this
                        matter was serious, and that it would be well to receive Prof. Coolidge’s
                        report in the premises. Mr. Lansing believed, however, that such a report
                        had been received within the last day or two from Vienna, and asked that
                        this matter be investigated. He added, however, that if he were mistaken in
                        this belief, he would gladly join the other Commissioners in approving the
                        telegram to Prof. Coolidge, attached to Memorandum No. 86.</p>
                    <p>6. Mr. Herter read a letter from Mr. Westermann. The Commissioners agreed
                        that if Mr. Westermann were asked as to the attitude of the United States in
                        regard to the London Agreement of April 1915<note n="43" xml:id="d14fn43"

                        should reply that we did not recognize either of these agreements as having
                        any bearing upon the final settlement in the Dodecanese or in the Near-East.
                        In fact, the United States intends to completely ignore these agreements in
                        the discussion of these problems unless by chance, they happen to contain
                        certain provisions which we consider <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0087"
                        />to be just and proper, in accordance with our declared principles.</p>
                    <p>7. Mr. Herter read a memorandum prepared by Mr. White in regard to the
                        request of the Panama delegation for the services of Colonel Arthur D. Budd
                        of the 311th Regiment of the A. E. F. The Commissioners decided that there
                        would be absolutely no objection to Colonel Budd’s serving with the
                        delegation from Panama in Paris, but that it would be impossible for the
                        Commission to request General Pershing to release him for this purpose. Any
                        arrangement that would have to be made by Colonel Budd in order to have
                        himself assigned for duty to the delegation of Panama would be a matter
                        which he himself would have to take up with the proper authorities of the A.
                        E. F.</p>
                    <p>8. Memorandum No. 87 was read. The question of reducing the subsistence
                        allowance for officers attached to the Commission from 40 francs a day to 30
                        francs a day was considered. The Commissioners felt that they were not in a
                        position at the present time to decide this matter, but that it should be
                        referred to the Committee composed of General Bliss, Mr. White, Mr. Patchin
                        and Mr. McNeir for final decision.</p>
                    <p>9. Mr. McCormick entered the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Mr. McCormick was asked about the qualifications of Mr. Jerome Greene for the
                        position of Secretary to the Reparations Committee. He explained that Mr.
                        Greene has served for over a year with the Inter-Allied Maritime Council,
                        and had in all respects sufficient experience to make him excellently
                        qualified for the position. The Commissioners were satisfied with this
                        explanation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. McCormick then went on to explain the difficulties which the Committee on
                        Reparations was having at the present time. For ten days the interpretation
                        of the word “reparation” had been discussed and as yet no solution had been
                        reached. The United States supported only in a rather feeble way by Belgium
                        was standing out alone in the interpretation of this word against all the
                        other powers. Mr. McCormick felt that this was an extremely delicate and
                        important matter, and that we might perhaps have now come to the parting of
                        the ways. He felt that since an impasse had been reached it would be
                        necessary to refer this whole question back for decision to those persons
                        who had drafted the Allied acceptance of the President’s principles with the
                        two reservations in regard to the freedom of the seas and the meaning of the
                        word reparation.<note n="45" xml:id="d14fn45">See telegrams No. 12 and No.
                            13, October 30, 1918, from the Special Representative to the Secretary

                                p. 468</ref>.</note> Mr. Lansing felt that inasmuch as the
                        memorandum embodying the views of the <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0088"
                        />Allies had been definitely filed with the Government of the United States
                        this matter should settle it and that they had no cause for withdrawing from
                        their original decision. Mr. McCormick explained that certain arguments were
                        very difficult to combat. For instance, Serbia contended that none of the
                        American arguments held good in her case because of the fact that she was
                        fighting Austria-Hungary and not Germany. Likewise the British though
                        insisting that the cost of the war be included under the heading reparation,
                        at the same time was promising to the small states certain priority rights.
                        These promises were keeping all the small states except Belgium on her side.
                        He added that this whole matter was very unfortunate from a political point
                        of view. The President had already approved of the principles which the
                        Reparation Committee was acting upon, but it might be advisable to get
                        further instructions from the President before this matter went too far.
                        There would be no use in fighting it out to the end if it were referred to
                        the Council of Ten [or?] if the President were perhaps willing to recede to
                        a certain extent. Mr. Lansing thought that we should cable the President at
                        once to send to the Reparation Committee a statement which could be read
                        together with confidential instructions for its guidance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. McCormick went on to explain that France’s present plan seemed to be to
                        get Germany to sign a blank check which could be later filled in. France was
                        evidently getting nervous at not being able to fix definitely the sum which
                        Germany could pay.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that a cable should be sent to the President requesting his
                        views in the premises.</p>
                    <p>10. Mr. McCormick withdrew, and Prof. Philip Marshall Brown entered the
                        meeting. Prof. Brown said that he had wished to speak to the Commissioners
                        about the German propaganda which was being carried on among the American
                        troops in the army of occupation, which he personally had had a chance to
                        observe at Coblenz. He said that many of our soldiers were now beginning to
                        “wonder how we ever got on the side of the frogs”. The whole attitude of
                        both the men and officers had gone very far. He felt that something very
                        radical had to be done from on top to impress the men with the necessity for
                        their remaining in Germany and supporting the Peace Conference in trying to
                        gain the sort of peace for which they had fought.</p>
                    <p>Prof. Brown stated that he had had a conversation with General Dickman, and
                        had been much impressed by the fact that the General was very anti-British
                        and anti-French. In fact, his attitude seemed entirely wrong. Prof. Brown
                        suggested that the Commissioners ask the President or General Pershing to
                        send some message to our soldiers which would counteract this German
                        propaganda.</p>
                    <p>General Bliss stated that in his opinion the whole feeling of our troops in
                        the occupied area was absolutely natural, but he did not <pb n="53"
                            xml:id="pg_53" facs="0089"/>believe that any message which the President
                        could send would do very much good. He asked whether, if it came to a
                        show-down, our soldiers would not fight again, which Prof. Brown answered,
                        that he was sure they would fight again.</p>
                    <p>General Bliss then stated that the whole question came back to the
                        criminality of the Peace Conference not making peace. He added that in the
                        first place he had advised strongly against sending any army of occupation
                        into Germany but of completely disarming and demobilizing Germany at the
                        very outset. He added that as things were going Bolshevism would come
                        everywhere if peace were not made soon.</p>
                    <p>Prof. Brown commented that time was working against us, and that the
                        situation now in England was very serious. It is even reported that Lloyd
                        George’s position was very shaken.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing then suggested that the question of the President’s sending a
                        message to the soldiers should be referred to General Bliss for final
                        decision.</p>

                    <p>1. Mr. McNeir stated that yesterday Colonel Cloman representing the Financial
                        Section of the A. E. F. had come to him and had presented him with a bill of
                        over $500,000 for the service rendered by the Army in connection with the
                        Peace Commission. This bill covered every sort of expense from the complete
                        cost of the automobiles in use to the expense of the infirmary, and the
                        commutation, subsistence and salary of all officers including General Bliss.
                        A letter was attached to this bill from General Harts explaining its
                        contents.</p>
                    <p>General Bliss suggested that this bill be sent to Washington for the
                        Secretary of War to act on. All the Commissioners felt that it was a
                        ridiculous charge to make against the Commission …</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing then suggested that Mr. McNeir should draft a telegram to the
                        Secretary of War which General Bliss agreed to sign, summarizing the items
                        included in the bill, and stating the great surprise which the Commissioners
                        felt at receiving such a bill sent to the Peace Commission. Mr. Lansing then
                        felt that a wireless message <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0090"
                        />repeating the above telegram should be sent to the President in order that
                        he might take up this matter with Secretary Baker upon his arrival in
                        Washington. He noted that the President was very anxious to keep down the
                        expenses of the Peace Commission, at least on paper.</p>
                    <p>Mr. McNeir then asked whether special allotments for outside missions and
                        armistice expenses should be made in the mission’s funds. He stated that he
                        had before him a request for $15,000 for the American mission to Poland and
                        one for $10,000 for the armistice mission at Trèves. The Commissioners
                        agreed to approve $10,000 for the Commission to Poland, and to allot further
                        funds to this Commission if it was necessary at a later date. They also
                        agreed that Mr. McNeir should obtain further information from General
                        Churchill regarding the necessity of $10,000 for the armistice
                        commission.</p>
                    <p>Mr. McNeir stated that he had drawn $45,000 for Prof. Coolidge’s Commission
                        to Vienna on the understanding that it should come from the State Department
                        emergency fund and not from the Peace Commission’s allotment. Mr. Lansing
                        stated that Mr. McNeir’s understanding in this matter was correct, and that
                        this matter should be cleared up at once.</p>
                    <p>Mr. McNeir left the meeting and Brigadier General Phillips (British) was then
                        called in. General Phillips declared that in a conversation with General
                        Bliss last night he had explained certain matters in regard to the Albania
                        situation which he desired to repeat to the Commissioners. General Wilson
                        had agreed that all information which he had should be put at the disposal
                        of the American Commissioners.</p>
                    <p>General Phillips went on to explain that in his 7 years experience in Albania
                        he had had an opportunity of examining closely the question of the so called
                        Albania massacre by the Montenegrins and Serbians. Much literature had been
                        prepared on this subject but General Phillips was surprised to find that the
                        Albania claims which had been sent to the American Embassy at Rome had never
                        reached the Embassy.</p>
                    <p>At the present time, the situation in Albania is extremely bad. It is not in
                        need of immediate food, but will shortly require organized <hi rend="italic"
                            >ravitaillement</hi>. In the mountains of Montenegro the people are
                        starving, but it is very difficult to feed them because of the great
                        corruption that exists and the hardships encountered in transporting the
                        food. Both the Montenegrins and the Serbians are doing all they can to hold
                        the Buana, a purely Albanian river, and to prevent the shipment of food
                        supplies on this river. General Phillips felt that it was extremely
                        important that all ships going from Scutari up this river should be made to
                        pay a small tax in accordance with the British toll system, and that in this
                        way the shipping could be controlled.</p>
                    <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0091"/>
                    <p>When General Phillips was in command of the International forces in Albania
                        in 1914 he had promised the Albanians autonomy. It was therefore with deep
                        regret that he learned of the pact of London of 1915 whereby Albania was
                        split between Serbia and Greece. He felt strongly that the Albanians, a
                        people which were purer than any others in Europe, with a higher sense of
                        morality, a pure strain and dauntless courage should be made autonomous, but
                        should, until such a time as they are able to establish a firm government,
                        be under the protectorate of some great power. General Phillips believed
                        that Italy should be this power, although he was conscious that the
                        Albanians were hostile to the Italians because they felt that Italy could
                        not govern herself and could not successfully withstand the Jugo-Slavs.</p>
                    <p>General Phillips stated very strongly that in his opinion over half of the
                        whole Albanian question could be settled if only the Peace Conference would
                        now determine the boundaries of Albania, leaving to a later discussion the
                        question of the protecting power and their form of government.</p>
                    <p>General Phillips then went into a short resume of Albanian history,
                        explaining how these people were made up of 5 great tribes whose history ran
                        back 2500 years. They are Illyrians by heritage, speak Albanian only, and
                        live by tribal law. At different times 2 of these tribes had been given to
                        Montenegro by various of the great powers as a sop for favors rendered, and
                        these gifts had caused tremendous unrest and hatred in the souls of the
                        Albanians.</p>
                    <p>General Phillips declared that he was unable to understand the present policy
                        of France in Albania. The French Colonel in command was openly telling the
                        people that France was on the verge of war with Italy, whereas at the same
                        time the Italians were telling the Albania people the same story, likewise
                        France had told Albania that all her land would be restored to her which of
                        course is a statement most unfavorable to France’s Ally Serbia. Undoubtedly
                        France wishes to become the protector of Albania not because of any direct
                        benefits to be derived therefrom, but for the sake of weakening Italy’s
                        prestige.</p>
                    <p>In General Phillips’ opinion, if the Albania delegates who truly represent
                        Albania were allowed to come to Paris, much of the internal fighting would
                        stop. This has been the Albanians’ great weakness. Even in America where
                        there are 200,000 Albanians, four distinct groups all opposed to each other
                        have been formed. Nevertheless, the people of Albania seem anxious to have a
                        British or preferably an American protectorate. Italy, however, both
                        historically and geographically is the most logical country for this
                        purpose, and the Italians would not encroach upon the Albanians because as
                        settlers they never leave the coast. If only Essad Pasha could be kept from
                        Albania there is some chance of unity being arrived at.</p>
                    <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0092"/>
                    <p>General Phillips felt very strongly that Albania had the right to know at
                        once what the future scope of her territories would be. He stated that he
                        himself was in a position to calm Albanians or to start them on a war-path
                        against the Montenegrins and Serbians by merely stating what the attitude of
                        the Peace Conference was in regard to their claims. The following districts,
                        tribes or towns of the north should be incorporated in the Albanian State:

                    <p>The most important was the district of Debra.</p>
                    <p>Acting on the other questions in the Balkans, General Phillips explained that
                        Venizelos had included in his platform, which caused the exile of King
                        Constantine from Greece, the promise of the return of Constantinople to
                        Greece. He likewise stated that neither Montenegro or Serbia would ever be
                        content until they got Scutari, that likewise the Albanians would never rest
                        quiet until the flag which he had promised them in 1914 had been assured to
                        them. Sixteen times in all this country had been besieged.</p>
                    <p>General Phillips ended his statement by declaring that the establishment of
                        an autonomous Albania would form a great bulwark between the Jugo-Slavs and
                        the East.</p>
                    <p>2. Mr. Herter read a telegram received by Mr. Gompers from the Shipyard
                        Workers in the Northwest in regard to the spread of Bolshevism. The
                        Commissioners immediately asked whether this telegram had been sent to the
                        President by Mr. Gompers, and felt that if it had not it should be.</p>
                    <p>3. Mr. Herter brought up the matter of loaning $60,000,000 to German-Austria,
                        as suggested to Mr. Grew by Mr. Strauss for the Commissioners’
                        consideration. The Commissioners were unable to understand exactly how this
                        loan would work out, and therefore requested that they be allowed to speak
                        to Mr. Strauss for about five minutes during the meeting tomorrow
                        morning.</p>
                    <p>4. Mr. Herter translated a note to the Commissioners in regard to Mr.
                            Lasteyrie’s<note n="46" xml:id="d15fn46">Count Charles de Lasteyrie,
                            French financial expert and member of the secretariat of the Commission

                        mission into Germany. The Commissioners felt that the excuse of the French
                        in this matter was very weak, and a letter should be immediately drafted to
                        Mr. Loucheur to the effect that no invitation had ever been received from
                        the French to send American representatives on the mission in <pb n="57"

                        States had never had an opportunity to discuss with the other members of the
                        associated governments a policy which, in their opinion, resembles much the
                        German policy of removing industrial machinery from the occupied
                        territory.</p>
                    <p>Memorandum No. 88 was read regarding the belief of Messrs. McCormick, Baruch,
                        Davis, Lamont and Strauss that Messrs. Lamont and McFadden should go as
                        Economic representatives of the United States with the Permanent Armistice
                        Commission at Spa. The Commissioners were a little confused on this whole
                        matter, and requested that Mr. McCormick or Mr. Baruch come to one of their
                        meetings to explain it, bringing at the same time a copy of the resolutions
                        of the Supreme War Council authorizing the appointment of such Economic
                        representatives to the Armistice Commission.</p>
                    <p>5. Memorandum No. 89 was read and it was decided that the Commissioners would
                        be glad to see the American Federation of Labor Mission on Saturday morning
                        at 11 o’clock. They desired, however, that in the reply which was to be sent
                        to Mr. Gompers, it be stated that the Commissioners had other appointments
                        at 11:30 and would therefore be grateful if the Mission could arrive
                        promptly.</p>
                    <p>6. Memorandum No. 90 was brought up regarding the desire of the Sons of the
                        American Revolution to have the American Peace Mission present a wreath to
                        be placed on the monument of George Washington on February 22nd. The
                        Commissioners felt that they had hardly come to Paris for this purpose, and
                        that as they would have much business to do on Saturday morning, including
                        the receiving of Mr. Gompers and his party, they were afraid they would have
                        to refuse. At the same time they felt that this matter was one which came
                        slightly within the jurisdiction of the Embassy.</p>
                    <p>7. Mr. Herter brought up the question of Lieut. Cobb’s assignment to the
                        Commission for duty with the American Delegates to the Reparation
                        Commission. The Commissioners were delighted at the thought that a good
                        American interpreter had been found, and approved highly the assignment of
                        Lieut. Cobb to the Commission.</p>
                    <p>8. Memorandum No. 91 was read in regard to the President’s desire that rooms
                        be reserved in the Crillon for the personnel attached to him as indicated in
                        that memorandum. The Commissioners felt that at the time when these
                        gentlemen returned it would be well to have accommodations for them in the
                        hotel, although it was clearly stated that these accommodations need not be
                        the same as those which they occupied before their departure.</p>
                    <p>The whole question of space in the hotel Crillon was discussed at some
                        length, and the Commissioners felt that aside from their own offices they
                        would be glad to have as many personnel living in the Crillon and as few
                        offices as was possible. They therefore hoped that Mr. Grew would maintain a
                        very stiff attitude in regard to requests <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58"
                            facs="0094"/>for more rooms that came from anyone except the
                        Commissioners, and if possible to try and persuade the technical advisors to
                        have rooms elsewhere. They realize that it would be very difficult to kick
                        the technical advisors out at the present time, but suggested that if any
                        technical advisor asked for more space he should be told that there is
                        plenty of space available elsewhere in Paris and that the Commissioners
                        would be delighted if he go [<hi rend="italic">went?</hi>] out and found
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing inquired whether he might be informed as to Mr. Hoover’s status
                        at the present time. Whether it had been definitely agreed to allow Mr.
                        Hoover [to] keep his office in the Crillon. General Bliss observed that the
                        Personnel Committee would shortly begin its work of clearing out dead timber
                        and that then perhaps more space both for living quarters and for the
                        absolutely necessary office rooms would be found.</p>
                    <p>9. Memorandum No. 92 was read containing the recommendation submitted by Mr.
                        Beer in regard to the treatment of Liberian [omission?] affairs was
                        considered. These recommendations were in general approved. The
                        Commissioners felt that some of them should [see?] Mr. Beer in order to have
                        the whole matter explained, and it was decided that Mr. White and General
                        Bliss would do this.</p>
                    <p>10. Memorandum No. 93 was considered in regard to the assignment of Captain
                        Lester W. Perrin to the Austro-Hungarian Commission. The Commissioners were
                        unable to see exactly how Captain Perrin’s previous experience fitted him
                        for work in regard to Austro-Hungarian affairs, but nevertheless were
                        willing to accept the recommendations of Dr. Mezes and Dr. Seymour in the
                        premises. They therefore approved of the assignment of Captain Perrin to the
                        Commission.</p>
                    <p>11. Memorandum No. 94 was read, requesting on behalf of Mr. Jerome D. Greene
                        the assignment of Lieut. Henry James to the Mission for duties in connection
                        with the Reparations Committee. The Commissioners approved the assignment of
                        Lieut. James for the purpose mentioned.</p>
                    <p>12. Mr. Herter brought up the question of Mr. Jerome D. Greene’s acting as a
                        head of a Bureau or Department. The Commissioners approved that in his
                        particular case all would be well, and that they would trust him absolutely
                        as far as the organization of his Bureau went. At the same time they did not
                        appear very anxious to have him select assistants, secretaries, clerks,
                        typists and messengers who are to be put on the Commission pay-roll, without
                        at least putting through the formal request which even the Commissioners
                        themselves have to make. It was decided that Mr. Greene be informed that he
                        will have complete freedom in the ordering of supplies and matters of this
                        sort, but that in the matter of personnel, lie would have to conform to the
                        regulations which every other office has to follow.</p>

                    <p>1. Mr. Lansing stated that he had heard that Mr. Hoover had sent to the
                        Commission an important document in regard to the general food situation. He
                        stated that he had not seen this report, and inquired whether it had been
                        brought to the attention of any of the other Commissioners. Mr. White and
                        General Bliss stated that they had not seen this report. It was suggested
                        that this matter be looked up and the report brought to the attention of all
                        the Commissioners.</p>
                    <p>2. Mr. Dulles called attention to the memorandum of Lieut. Colonel Miles
                        regarding Prof. Coolidge’s action in approving the investigation of a
                        temporary boundary line between the German-Austrians and Slovenes in
                        Carinthia. General Bliss stated that Colonel Miles was in the Crillon and
                        suggested that he be heard briefly in regard to the matter. Before calling
                        Colonel Miles into the meeting, Mr. Dulles read a portion of a telegram from
                        the American Chargé at Belgrade transmitting an informal protest of the
                        Slovene Government against the provisional line which it was understood the
                        American investigators had determined upon. (Colonel Miles entered.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing inquired whether the Commissioners were called upon to take any
                        action in regard to the Carinthian boundary dispute. Colonel Miles answered
                        that Prof. Coolidge desired an expression of opinion from the Commission
                        before any further action was taken towards making public the line of
                        demarcation which had been agreed upon. Mr. Lansing inquired whether Prof.
                        Coolidge had been authorized to arrange this boundary dispute. General Bliss
                        stated that he had not and added that it was his personal opinion that if a
                        decision was published, the Commission would be placed in an embarrassing
                        position. Mr. Lansing agreed with General Bliss that no publication of this
                        boundary decision should be made and inquired whether the line which the
                        Americans had determined upon was not generally known to the inhabitants of
                        the territory immediately concerned, and whether it would not be respected
                        as a more or less unwritten agreement by these peoples.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners all agreed that any publicity given to this matter would be
                        most unfortunate and might lead to complications <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60"
                            facs="0096"/>which would embarrass the government and the American
                        Commission.</p>
                    <p>Mr. White inquired whether it would not be possible to communicate the
                        results of Col. Miles’ investigation informally to the local authorities
                        concerned as embodying the personal opinion of Prof. Coolidge in regard to
                        the territory in dispute. General Bliss suggested an oral communication of
                        this nature. (Mr. Lansing was called from the meeting.)</p>
                    <p>General Bliss and Mr. White continued the discussion of the boundary
                        question, and Lieut. Colonel Miles gave further explanations of the
                        circumstances of the investigation, pointing out that Prof. Coolidge had
                        been led to approve the action which had been taken, in the interest of
                        avoiding further unnecessary bloodshed. Both General Bliss and Mr. White
                        agreed that there were only two courses possible, either that Prof. Coolidge
                        should say nothing further about the whole matter, or, second, that he
                        should write a personal note or send a personal oral message to the parties
                        to the dispute to the general effect that he (Prof. Coolidge) had on his own
                        initiative asked American officers to look over the territory to see whether
                        an informal and temporary solution could be reached with a view to a
                        cessation of hostilities—that in view of the fact that one of the parties to
                        the dispute had already protested, i. e. the Serbians, it appeared that no
                        further action was possible, and that the results of the investigation would
                        not therefore be given out unless both parties requested it and that in any
                        case any statement he might make would be only his personal opinion and
                        would not bind either party.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that Mr. White should draw up a letter in the above sense
                        which might be communicated to Prof. Coolidge for his guidance when Colonel
                        Miles returned. General Bliss and Mr. White expressed the opinion that Prof.
                        Coolidge had apparently become more deeply involved in the matter than he
                        should have, and possibly more deeply than appeared from his written
                        reports, that the American Commission should not in any way permit itself to
                        be accused of playing a lone hand in this matter, and that Prof. Coolidge
                        must get out of the tangle so as not to involve either the Commission or the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>General Bliss remarked that such incidents sometimes made him wish for the
                        withdrawal of all the American field parties.</p>
                    <p>3. Mr. Sweetser was called into the meeting in connection with Memorandum No.
                        95, which had to do with the indiscretion of Mr. Talley in violating the
                        President’s confidence by his article in the “Paris Herald” of February
                        16th. Mr. Sweetser recommended that the suggestion of the Press Committee of
                        investigation—that Mr. Talley be excluded for two weeks from the meetings of
                        the Commission—be <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0097"/>approved. This
                        recommendation was accepted, and it was decided that Mr. White should
                        communicate the Commission’s decision at the morning meeting of the press
                        correspondents.</p>
                    <p>4. The meeting was postponed until 12 o’clock, when Mr. Strauss appeared
                        before the Commissioners (present Mr. Lansing, Mr. White, General Bliss) to
                        speak in regard to the proposed loan of $60,000,000 to German-Austria to
                        enable it to purchase foodstuffs. Mr. Strauss stated that the Austrian
                        financiers who were at present in Paris discussing the food situation of
                        Austria with Mr. Hoover had suggested the following securities for such a
                        loan: (1) Austrian crowns; (2) Austrian securities abroad; (3) mortgage on
                        Austrian salt mines; (4) mortgage on the Vienna tramway, light, heat system,
                        etc. Mr. Strauss was of the opinion that none of these securities were of
                        very great value, and said that it had been suggested that priority on the
                        reparation which German-Austria might pay would be the best security. He
                        stated that he was of the opinion that Italy, France and England might make
                        no objection in case the “United States advances the same sum to them for
                        their purchases of food from the United States. Italy, he said, seemed to be
                        willing to appear in the role of the benefactor towards her former enemy,
                        Austria.</p>
                    <p>There was some question in the minds of the Commissioners as to whether such
                        a stipulation in regard to priority in receiving reparation would have to
                        appear in the peace treaty. General Bliss was of the opinion that this could
                        be forced through if the Council of Ten could agree. Mr. Lansing remarked
                        that it would be necessary to get the other countries of the former Monarchy
                        to consent, in view of their claims on German-Austria.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Strauss remarked on the terrible situation in Vienna, as far as could be
                        judged from the reports which Mr. Hoover had received. General Bliss
                        remarked that Mr. Hoover was preparing a memorandum on this whole question,
                        which he hoped could be presented to the Supreme War Council. At Mr.
                        Lansing’s suggestion, Mr. Strauss volunteered to prepare a memorandum in
                        regard to the proposed loan to German-Austria, and Mr. Lansing agreed to
                        endeavor to have this put upon the agenda of the Council of Ten.</p>
                    <p>4 [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. The Commissioners expressed surprise at Mr.
                        Howe’s action in returning to Paris from Brindisi rather than proceeding on
                        his mission to Syria. Mr. White said that Mr. Howe apparently felt that
                        under present conditions of British and French occupation he would be unable
                        to do any useful work. Some doubt was expressed as to whether Mr. Howe’s
                        expenses should be paid for this useless journey. Mr. White remarked that he
                        was afraid they should be paid, in which Mr. Lansing and General Bliss
                        concurred.</p>
                    <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0098"/>
                    <p>5. A letter from Mr. Auchincloss and a memorandum from Mr. Norman Davis was
                        read regarding the assignment of Mr. Oscar T. Crosby to prepare a special
                        report on: (1) debt of Austria-Hungary; (2) the amount of currency and notes
                        issued in Austria-Hungary; and (3) the principles to be followed in
                        determining the share of obligation at the time of dismemberment of the
                        Empire. The President’s telegram to the Secretary of the Treasury,
                        expressing the wish that Mr. Crosby should hold himself available for
                        consultation on financial matters for the Peace Conference, was noted. It
                        was remarked that it was not clear from this telegram whether the President
                        really desired his appointment to the Commission or not. It was decided that
                        Mr. Lansing should take up the matter with Mr. Norman Davis and also with
                        Mr. Strauss, as Mr. Strauss’ report in regard to the proposed Austrian loan
                        appeared to have to do with the same subject for which Mr. Crosby’s services
                        were desired.</p>
                    <p>6. A telegram regarding cooperation with the British and French Admirals in
                        the Adriatic, which had previously been submitted to Admiral Benson and
                        approved, was read and accepted by the Commissioners. It was felt that
                        Admiral Benson’s judgment in this matter should be accepted.</p>
                    <p>7. It was decided that Memorandum No. 96, quoting a statement of the Serbian
                        Prime Minister to Chargé Dodge to the effect that the American Commission
                        had inquired whether Serbia would consent to submit to the President the
                        Italian-Jugo-Slav territorial question, should be submitted to Colonel
                        House. Mr. Lansing stated that he had no knowledge that any such inquiry had
                        been made by the American Commission and desired that information be
                        obtained whether Colonel House had any knowledge that the President had
                        given any such intimation.</p>
                    <p>8. Information Memorandum No. 21 containing recommendations in regard to
                        Russia, was submitted to the Commissioners and read in part. Mr. Lansing
                        observed that point 7, recommending favorable consideration of the requests
                        of the Esthonian, Letton and Lithuanian Governments for material support,
                        credits and supplies, was at present impossible, as no legislative action
                        permitting this had ever been passed.</p>
                    <p>9. Portions of the report of the Danish Red Cross on Bolshevik atrocities
                        were brought to the attention of the Commissioners, who expressed their
                        horror and approved of the telegram to Copenhagen asking that any
                        corroborative evidence which might be obtained should be submitted to the
                        Commission.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>1. General Bliss remarked that there was a meeting of General Foch’s special
                        committee which was studying military and naval terms, at 11 o’clock, at
                        which he must be present.</p>
                    <p>2. Mr. Lansing stated that he had conferred with Mr. Davis and Mr. Strauss in
                        regard to Mr. Oscar T. Crosby’s being attached to the Commission to study
                        problems of Austro-Hungarian finance. Both Mr. Davis and Mr. Strauss felt
                        that Mr. Crosby was the man for this investigation and strongly recommended
                        his appointment. It was decided that Mr. Grew should write a letter to Mr.
                        Crosby advising him that he was attached to the Commission for the above
                        mentioned work, and that before sending the letter he should confer with
                        Colonel House, in order to make sure that all the Commissioners were agreed
                        on this point.</p>
                    <p>3. Mr. White referred to a letter which had been received from Mr. Howe,
                        explaining the circumstances of his hasty return from Brindisi without
                        carrying out his mission to Syria. …</p>
                    <p>4. Mr. Dulles read a telegram from Mr. Buckler in which he definitely
                        declined the appointment to Warsaw. Mr. Lansing remarked that he had had a
                        talk with Mr. Hugh Gibson, who had stated to him that he felt it was a
                        mistake to send a diplomatic agent or Chargé d’Affaires to Prague, as the
                        Czechs would be offended if they did not have a full Minister, and Mr.
                        Gibson added that an American Chargé or Diplomatic Agent would be outranked
                        by all Allied representatives. Mr. Lansing stated that on further
                        consideration he shared Mr. Gibson’s views and felt that the same
                        considerations applied to Warsaw. He believed therefore that no
                        representatives should be sent until the bill now pending before Congress
                        was passed, which would make it possible to send Ministers Plenipotentiary
                        to both these posts. Mr. Lansing added that he had conferred in this matter
                        with Colonel House.</p>
                    <p>5. Mr. White remarked that Mr. Buckler’s decision would leave him available
                        to go to Syria to replace Mr. Howe. He added that Mr. Buckler was well
                        qualified for such a mission, as he had spent a great deal of time in
                        archeological work in Asia Minor. The Commissioners accepted Mr. White’s
                        recommendation and decided that <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0100"/>the
                        question of sending Mr. Buckler to Syria should be taken up immediately. Mr.
                        Dulles stated that Mr. Dominian had been sent for by the Commission for work
                        in Asia Minor or Syria, that he was already on the ocean, and suggested that
                        he be considered in connection with the sending of Mr. Buckler to Syria.</p>
                    <p>6. Mr. White referred to the report from Mr. Hoover regarding the
                        difficulties which had been met in dealing with the Allies regarding the
                        conditions of food distribution. Mr. White read parts of Mr. Hoover’s
                        report, and his four recommendations of the action to be taken unless the
                        Allies changed their present attitude. Mr. Lansing remarked that the Allies
                        often seemed to desire America to pay, to arrange for transportation, and
                        then to reserve for themselves the entire control over the distribution.
                        General Bliss remarked that action on Mr. Hoover’s proposal would result in
                        a show-down, and we would know where we stood. Mr. Lansing stated that there
                        were certain financial difficulties which were sometimes overlooked, and
                        that before action could be precipitated it would be necessary for Mr.
                        Hoover’s memorandum to be studied by the financial experts of the
                        Commission.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that Mr. White should personally take up Mr. Hoover’s
                        memorandum with Messrs. Strauss, Lamont and Davis.</p>
                    <p>[7.] Mr. White stated that he had seen General Churchill, who had expressed
                        the opinion that he should return to America. General Churchill stated that
                        he had originally been sent over to be of possible service to the Secretary
                        of War in case he came to Europe, and that now as he had no particular
                        function, he had best return with the members of his immediate staff.
                        General Churchill had stated that he could leave those of his staff who were
                        necessary for the work of “The Inquiry”, and also possibly Captain
                        Tyler.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners took note of Mr. White’s report and agreed that it would be
                        desirable to fall in with General Churchill’s desire that he return to the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>8. Mr. White referred to statements of Colonel Miles in yesterday’s meeting
                        regarding the Carinthian boundary dispute, and read a proposed draft of a
                        letter which should be submitted to Prof. Coolidge for his guidance. It was
                        decided that the letter should be redrafted under Mr. White’s direction, and
                        should merely state, in view of the protest of one of the parties to the
                        dispute to the friendly unofficial assistance which they had requested, it
                        was deemed best that the entire matter should be considered closed. (General
                        Bliss withdrew.)</p>
                    <p>9. Indignation was expressed over Memorandum No. 97 regarding French
                        interference with cipher telegraphic communication between the Coolidge
                        party and the Mission. It was decided that the matter should be taken up
                        immediately. The recommendation that it be taken up by the Peace Commission
                        with the French Foreign <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0101"/>Office was
                        not approved, but instructions were given that a strong letter should be
                        written to the Embassy, which the Embassy might show to the Foreign
                        Office.</p>
                    <p>10. It was felt that it would be necessary to confer with Admiral Benson in
                        regard to Memorandum No. 98 which contained recommendations in regard to the
                        status of Admiral Bristol at Constantinople. With reference to the specific
                        requests of Admiral Bristol, it was decided: one, that a telegram should be
                        addressed to Mr. Heck to obtain his opinion in regard to permitting Admiral
                        Bristol to make use of the Embassy; two, that Admiral Bristol should not be
                        given credentials which would put him in control of the work of all American
                        agencies in Constantinople. Mr. Lansing remarked that we were not at war
                        with Turkey and that we should not therefore have a military or naval
                        official as our chief representative there.</p>
                    <p>11. The attention of the Commission was called to Memorandum No. 99 regarding
                        Colonel Cunningham’s alleged statements in Budapest that he represented
                        Great Britain, France and the United States, and that unless the Hungarians
                        stamped out Bolshevism the Entente would allow the Czechs, Servians and
                        Roumanians to occupy all of Hungary. … It was decided that this telegram
                        should be repeated to Ambassador Davis at London with a request that he take
                        the matter up informally with the Foreign Office to ascertain whether the
                        Government has any knowledge that Colonel Cunningham has made any such
                        statements, and if so, on what authority.</p>
                    <p>12. Memorandum No. 100 was read. The Commissioners approved Admiral Benson’s
                        report on the Jugo-Slavs’ protest against the pooling of their ships. Mr.
                        Lansing felt that the correspondence should be filed without further action
                        as Admiral Benson recommended, and that unless the matter was revived no
                        letter should be addressed to Mr. Pichon.</p>
                    <p>13. With reference to Memorandum No. 101. The Commissioners did not know on
                        what authority the French army in the Orient had been instructed to request
                        the Servians to withdraw, and Mr. Lansing was not aware of any decision of
                        the Supreme War Council which dealt with this question. It was decided that
                        while Mr. Seymour might take up the matter informally at the next meeting of
                        the Committee which was studying the Servian boundary question, it would be
                        best that a formal inquiry should be made to the French Foreign Office
                        through the Embassy.</p>
                    <p>[14.] Both Mr. Lansing and Mr. White approved heartily of coordinating the
                        work of the Financial and Food representatives, and therefore approved the
                        appointment of Major Benjamin C. Joy for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>15. Further information was desired in regard to the circumstances under
                        which Mr. Henry E. Mills had been attached to Mr. McCormick, <pb n="66"
                            xml:id="pg_66" facs="0102"/>before passing upon the question of
                        attaching him to the Commission.</p>
                    <p>16. In regard to Mr. Gompers’ request that Francis E. Adams report to him for
                        duty as a translator, Mr. Lansing inquired whether there were not sufficient
                        translators already attached to the Commission without adding another. Mr.
                        White agreed that Mr. Gompers’ request should not be approved until it was
                        ascertained that a translator could not be furnished him from the persons
                        already attached to the Commission.</p>
                    <p>17. It was decided that the suggestion that an artist be attached to the
                        Commission to execute a portrait of the Peace Conference should be referred
                        to the Department of State as this was clearly a Governmental matter. If the
                        Government desired a portrait of the Peace Conference they should make an
                        appropriation for it.</p>
                    <p>18. It was unanimously decided that Washington’s birthday should be declared
                        a full holiday for the staff of the Commission.</p>

                                    of the American Federation of Labor, Mr. Gompers and
                                    others</item>

                    <p>1. Mr. White remarked that Mr. Howe desired to be definitely relieved of his
                        mission to Syria and suggested that this be done and that a telegram be sent
                        to Mr. Barton informing him of this fact. Mr. Lansing remarked that it was
                        so late in the day that he was skeptical of the wisdom of trying to send a
                        mission to Syria at the present time. General Bliss suggested that Emir
                        Feizal be called in to tell his story personally to the Commissioners, in
                        order that they might get an idea of the various factions in Syria, keeping
                        in mind, however, that Feizal represented only one position.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dulles suggested that it would be possible to request a member of the
                        staff of Beirut Protestant College to come immediately to Paris and report
                        on the political situation in Syria. He suggested George Stewart, the
                        Treasurer of the College, a man who had been <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67"
                            facs="0103"/>in Beirut during the entire war, as a reliable observer.
                        The Commissioners approved of the idea of trying to obtain personal
                        testimony from Syria, but desired that Mr. Bliss, the President of the
                        Beirut Protestant College, now in Paris, be consulted, and that Professor
                        Westermann’s views be obtained, and a definite recommendation made on the
                        basis of the reports of these two men. It was decided that Mr. Buckler
                        should not be sent to Syria.</p>
                    <p>2. Mr. Lansing read a message from M. Clemenceau, in which he expressed his
                        appreciation of the Commissioners’ solicitous inquiry at the time of his
                        accident.</p>
                    <p>3. (Mr. McCormick enters.) Mr. McCormick stated that in pursuance of the
                        decision of the Supreme War Council that civilians should be added to the
                        Armistice Commission as economic experts, he desired to propose the name[s]
                        of Mr. Lamont and Mr. McFadden as American members of the Armistice
                        Commission. Mr. McCormick remarked that Mr. Baruch, and Mr. Davis also Mr.
                        Strauss all approved and concurred in this recommendation.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners approved the appointment of Messrs. McFadden and Lamont to
                        the Armistice Commission.</p>
                    <p>4. General Bliss read a letter which he had received from General Patrick in
                        regard to the necessity of having someone attached to the Commission to deal
                        with the questions of aerial navigation which might be brought up. The
                        Commissioners were of the opinion that it would not be necessary to make any
                        one definite assignment for this task, as the work to be done would not be
                        sufficient to occupy the entire time of any one man, at least at present.
                        General Bliss stated that he would reply to General Patrick’s letter.</p>
                    <p>5. General Bliss read a draft of a telegram to the Secretary of War in regard
                        to the bill for over $500,000. which had been presented to the Commission by
                        General Harts for Army personnel and supplies. General Bliss’ telegram
                        expressed the Commission’s embarrassment at receiving such a bill, and
                        pointed out that the precedent of previous commissions on which army
                        officers had served would not seem to justify the action which had been
                        taken in this case.</p>
                    <p>6. Mr. Lansing referred to the necessity of having an expert on South
                        American affairs attached to the Commission and stated that Mr. Stabler had
                        been sent for. He inquired whether any information had been received
                        regarding the probable date of Stabler’s arrival, as there were South
                        American affairs of importance pending.</p>
                    <p>7. A telegram from the President regarding Winston Churchill’s policy in
                        Russia was read.<note n="46a" xml:id="d18fn46a"><ref
                                target="frus1919Russia#pg_71"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                    Relations</hi>, 1919, Russia, p. 71</ref>.</note> The
                        Commissioners decided that a telegram should be sent to the President to the
                        effect that Churchill’s project was dead, and that there was little danger
                        that it would be <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0104"/>revived again by the
                        Conference. General Bliss remarked that he had told Churchill that he must
                        have misunderstood the President, who would not have made the statement
                        which had been attributed to him regarding military action in Russia. The
                        Commissioners remarked that the President’s telegram, dated February 19 and
                        received on the 20th, had only been brought to their attention on the 22nd,
                        and desired that an investigation of this delay be made.</p>
                    <p>8. Mr. Dulles read excerpts from a letter addressed to Mr. Lansing by Count
                        Cellere of the Italian Delegation—from a note from the French Government to
                        the Embassy in Paris—and from a telegram from Borne containing reports from
                        Ensign Tree and Captain Bruce—all regarding the situation in Montenegro. The
                        Commissioners were unanimous that, notwithstanding Italian, French and
                        British representation, there was no reason to change the decision regarding
                        the despatch of American troops to Montenegro. Mr. Dulles suggested that
                        either Ensign Tree or Captain Bruce be instructed to proceed to Paris to
                        report in person to the Commission on the Montenegrin situation. This
                        suggestion was approved.</p>
                    <p>9. The Commissioners did not see the necessity of appointing a special
                        officer to do liaison work between the Commission and the Red Cross, and
                        were of the opinion that Red Cross matters should be taken up through the
                        usual channels. Mr. Dulles pointed out that the Red Cross was engaged in
                        many activities—relief of Russian prisoners as well as general relief work
                        in enemy countries, in regard to which the Commission should be informed. On
                        the facts presented, however, the Commissioners did not feel that a special
                        officer was necessary for this work.</p>
                    <p>10. With reference to the letter of the “Temperance and Social Service
                        Commission” to Mr. Grew, the Commissioners pointed out that this
                        organization stated that it intended to take up the prohibition question
                        with the Peace Conference through “the officially appointed representatives
                        of the anti-saloon league of America”. It was decided, therefore, that it
                        would not be necessary or advisable to present to the Secretary General the
                        resolutions attached with the letter from the Temperance and Social Service
                        Commission, and that it would be sufficient for Mr. Grew to merely
                        acknowledge receipt of this letter.</p>
                    <p>11. With reference to a telegram from the Department of State suggesting that
                        Turkey be informed that the abrogation of the capitulations was illegal, Mr.
                        Lansing observed that the United States had informed Turkey to this effect
                        in 1915,<note n="46b" xml:id="d18fn46b">See <ref target="frus1915#pg_1301"
                                    ><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1915, pp. 1301</ref>
                            ff.</note> and that it would, therefore, not be necessary to repeat such
                        a statement at the present time. He felt that it might weaken rather than
                        strengthen the original American protest against the abrogation of the
                        capitulations. The Commissioners <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0105"
                        />decided that a telegram in this sense should be sent to the Department of
                        State.</p>
                    <p>12. The Commissioners approved the recommendation on Memorandum No. 102
                        regarding the desire of Mr. Haidar Bammate to come to Paris to present to
                        the Peace Conference the case of the peoples of Circassia and Daghestan. It
                        was decided that the Embassy should be instructed to address a communication
                        to the French Foreign Office regarding Mr. Haidar Bammate.</p>
                    <p>13. (Colonel House enters.) A delegation of the American Federation of Labor
                        including Mr. Samuel Gompers, Mr. James Duncan, John R. Alpine, Frank Duffy
                        and William Green was introduced.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gompers spoke of the work of the American Federation of Labor. No labor
                        movement he said had stood behind its government so faithfully as the labor
                        movement under the American Federation of Labor in the United States. The
                        only possible comparison was that of Germany, where, unfortunately, labor
                        had lent its cooperation to the force of reaction. American labor could
                        flatter itself that it had “kept the faith”. The solidarity in American
                        labor ranks behind the government had kept American labor from joining
                        certain other labor movements of Europe which favored, at times, a
                        negotiated peace against which American labor had always protested.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gompers referred to the attack upon Clemenceau, the assassination of
                        Eisner and of other Bavarian leaders as a sign of the times, a manifestation
                        of what was seething in the ranks of the people throughout the world. To
                        meet this unrest, <hi rend="italic">something must be done</hi>, a peace
                        treaty containing merely legal phrases will not satisfy; labor must find in
                        the peace treaty a real recognition of its needs and demands. A defeated
                        army like Germany’s did not expect to find much at home, but for victorious
                        soldiers to go home and find no work is intolerable.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gompers referred to the Berne Socialists Congress which he had refused to
                        attend as he considered it a German scheme. He stated that the President had
                        openly expressed himself as approving this decision.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gompers gave to the Commissioners two papers, one, containing the
                        proposals submitted by the Delegates of the United States in the Commission
                        on International labor legislation, and two, the reconstruction program of
                        the American Federation of Labor.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing inquired how the reconstruction problem directly affected the
                        question of the peace treaty. Mr. Lansing added that the Commissioners
                        desired information which would be of help to them in the actual work of
                        preparing the peace treaty. Mr. Gompers admitted that the question of
                        reconstruction was hardly one which could be dealt with in a treaty.</p>
                    <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0106"/>
                    <p>Mr. Gompers then referred to a British proposition which was before the Labor
                        Commission regarding the construction of a permanent bureau in connection
                        with the League of Nations. He added that he felt that this bureau was a
                        step in the right direction, and that the American Labor Delegates were
                        helping, that they desired, however, the advice and help of the American
                        Commissioners. Mr. Lansing remarked that rather, the Labor Delegates should
                        give the Commissioners their advice on this subject.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gompers referred to another proposition which has been agitated namely,
                        the establishment of a super-national commission to include first the Allies
                        and later the neutral and the countries at present enemy countries. The plan
                        of this Commission contemplated four representatives from each country, two
                        appointed by the government, one appointed by employers, and one by labor.
                        Such a super-national parliament would enact legislation which according to
                        the proposed plan would become effective in each of the States concerned
                        unless specifically rejected by that State. Mr. Gompers stated that he and
                        his colleagues had fought this project. Colonel House referred to the
                        constitutional provisions of the United States which made any such project
                        absolutely impossible. General Bliss added that the nature of such a body
                        was such as to make it a possible danger to labor itself. Mr. Gompers stated
                        that while such schemes as the above were being discussed, unemployment was
                        greatly increasing at home. He referred to a number of dangerous signs among
                        American labor—the threat of a general strike on July 4th, unless, Mooney
                        was released—the movement “no beer no work”—strikes in Seattle, etc.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gompers stated that it was being quietly circulated about that faddist
                        parlor socialists were more agreeable to the Commission than the
                        representatives of American labor. Mr. Gompers referred to the rumour that
                        the Commission had supported the Berne Conference and sent representatives
                        there. Mr. Lansing inquired to whom Mr. Gompers referred. Mr. Gompers stated
                        that he had heard that Mr. Bullard had gone to Berne to represent the
                        Commission at the Conference. Mr. Lansing stated that this was absurd, that
                        a Mr. Bullitt had gone to Berne as an observer to report the doings of the
                        Conference to the Commission, and in no way as a representative to the
                        Conference, that in the same way Mr. Bullitt was now going to Russia as an
                        observer. Mr. Gompers stated that Mr. Bullitt was reported to be in sympathy
                        with the Bolshevists. Mr. Lansing stated that he was not a sympathizer with
                        the Bolshevists, nor was the Commission. Mr. Gompers referred to other
                        persons who were supposed to have great influence with the Commission and to
                        be of Bolshevik leanings—a Mr. Howe, and Captain Lippmann. Mr. Lansing
                        stated that he did not know Mr. Howe, that he had not seen Captain Lippmann
                        for <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0107"/>ten months, and he had never had
                        a private conversation with him; that he had heard of him as an editor of
                        the “New Republic”. Mr. Gompers referred to Mr. Walter Wile as another of
                        the persons who were of Bolshevik tendencies, in close touch with the
                        Commission. General Bliss stated that with the exception of Mr. Bullitt, the
                        men whom Mr. Gompers had mentioned were not well known to the Commission.
                        Mr. Gompers referred to Mr. Lansing’s reference to the “New Republic” and
                        stated that this periodical was Anti-administration, pro-German and of
                        extreme socialist tendencies. Mr. Lansing said that he had not read a copy
                        of the “New Republic” since the war.</p>
                    <p>Mr. James Duncan interrupted Mr. Gompers and gave a clear exposition of what
                        the American labor delegation desired. The American Federation of Labor, he
                        said, wanted their views incorporated into the Peace Treaty; <hi
                            rend="italic">organized labor must have this recognition</hi>. Labor had
                        done its best during the war and now something must be done for labor that
                        would be really constructive.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing replied expressing the Commission’s appreciation of what the
                        American Federation of Labor had achieved. He referred to what appeared to
                        be the significant fact of the present time—a break down of nationalism and
                        an increased emphasis on class against class cutting across national lines.
                        The Commissioners, he said, were alive to the seriousness of the
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing referred to the difficulty of handling the labor problem because
                        of internationalism and asked whether the Labor representatives were working
                        on the plan of the committee outlined under the League of Nations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Duncan stated that article 20 of the Covenant was first class but that
                        Labor wanted more details in regard to this Committee and that it was hard
                        for them to proceed without definite direction.</p>

                    <p>1. Colonel House stated that General Pershing had come to him yesterday and
                        had assured him that he had previously known nothing about the bill for over
                        half a millon dollars which had been submitted to the Commission by the
                        army. General Pershing believed <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0108"/>that
                        this matter had originated with General Harts, but at the same time felt
                        that General Harts had done so merely for the sake of indicating to the
                        Commission the present cost to the army of its assistance, and not with a
                        view to having the bill paid. He therefore asked that General Harts be
                        exonerated and the matter be forgotten. General Pershing added, however,
                        that in his opinion there were too many army men now attached to the
                        Commission, and that criticism sooner or later would have to be
                        expected.</p>
                    <p>Colonel House observed that the greatest need which the Commission had at the
                        present time was for trained civilians, particularly those who could take
                        high responsible positions. He added that all in all, however, our
                        situation, including technical advisors, was better than that of any other
                        nation, and that this had been repeatedly proved by our experts being able
                        to rectify statements made by the technical experts of other nations at the
                        Quai d’Orsay. Our financial men in particular, he said were far ahead of the
                        others, especially the British.</p>
                    <p>2. Mr. Lansing and Colonel House discussed the strange manner in which Mr.
                        Howe had acted by returning from Brindisi, half way on his trip to the
                        Near-East. They felt that in view of his actions it would be better to drop
                        him all together, but at the same time to ask Mr. Barton to go on alone. He
                        could then be later joined by the mission which was being organized by
                        Captain Tyler under the leadership of Mr. Dominian. In regard to the latter
                        gentleman, Colonel House observed that he was a <hi rend="italic">persona
                            grata</hi> with President Wilson and that it would be most acceptable to
                        the President if he, in conjunction with Mr. Barton, were made head of a
                        mission to the Near-East. In the meanwhile, however, both the Commissioners
                        felt that if the Commission knew of any reliable Syrians who wished to come
                        to Paris but were being stopped by the French, Italians or British, it would
                        be well for us to take steps to see that they were allowed to come on to
                        Paris.</p>
                    <p>3. Mr. Lansing told of a visit which he had received from a Commission of
                        Dalmatian religious functionaries representing the whole Diocese of
                        Dalmatia, including the Cardinal and a Franciscan. These gentlemen all
                        appeared to be very anti-Italian and assured Mr. Lansing that the sentiments
                        which they expressed were the ones which were really felt by the people of
                        Dalmatia. Colonel House at the same time remarked that a Mr. Seldon of the
                            <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, who had recently visited
                        Jugo-Slav territory had brought back a report, the authenticity of which
                        Colonel House could not vouch for, that the Jugo-Slavs were willing to make
                        a very reasonable proposal in regard to their claims.</p>
                    <p>4. Mr. Herter read a memorandum prepared by the Secretariat giving a list of
                        the names of the American Secretaries connected with <pb n="73"
                            xml:id="pg_73" facs="0109"/>the Peace Commission who were actually
                        engaged on the work with the Conference proper and not with any of its
                        branch committees. Mr. Lansing requested that he be allowed to keep this
                        memorandum as he had several names which he desired to add to the list.</p>
                    <p>5. Colonel House stated that he had just had a talk with Mr. Norman Davis
                        about the question of reparations, and that Mr. Davis had felt that it would
                        not be possible for us to get together with the French in this matter.
                        Colonel House had told him that if the Americans and French delegates were
                        unable to get together in the immediate future they should not waste their
                        time any longer but should draw up their report and send it to the Bureau of
                        Ten. He added that if in the Committee of Ten the French still insisted on
                        carrying out a project which was contrary to the wishes of the President and
                        contrary to the pledge which had been given to Germany before the signing of
                        the armistice we should then state that we wash our hands of the whole
                        business, and that for our part we would absolutely refuse to ask for any
                        indemnity from Germany. He added that unless this policy were followed
                        Germany could within four or five years repudiate any agreement which she is
                        now forced into by the associated governments on the grounds that it was
                        contrary to the agreement which she had entered into at the time of the
                        signing of the armistice, and that if Germany should make such a repudiation
                        all of the world would sympathize with her and there would undoubtedly be a
                        new war with a different line up.</p>
                    <p>6. Mr. Lansing stated that he had observed that in a draft proposal for a
                        peace treaty which had been submitted to him, no mention was made of the
                        League of Nations. He believed that the peace treaty which should be
                        submitted to Germany for signature should have incorporated in it an article
                        to the effect that the signatories to the treaty approve and consent to the
                        organization of a League of Nations as formulated in a document annexed to
                        that treaty. This would mean that the constitution of the League of Nations
                        would not be bodily incorporated in the treaty of peace but would merely be
                        an annex thereto. Mr. Lansing indicated that such a procedure would have the
                        advantage of allowing neutral countries to sign the constitution of the
                        League of Nations, but would at the same time exclude enemy countries from
                        signing it but would force them to approve it after it had been signed.
                        Colonel House considered this an excellent idea and hoped that Mr. Lansing
                        would develop it further.</p>
                    <p>7. The Commissioners stated that they preferred not to see Captain Voska at
                        the present time. They thought that it would be advisable, however, for
                        Captain Voska to see General Bliss and make a report to him, and that if the
                        latter then thought that the Commissioners ought to hear this report an
                        interview could be arranged for at a later date.</p>
                    <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0110"/>
                    <p>8. The telegram to Prof. Coolidge at Vienna regarding Colonel Miles’ decision
                        on the Carinthian boundary question was approved.</p>
                    <p>9. The telegram to the Department of State defining the purpose of Mr.
                        Bullitt’s mission was approved.<note n="47" xml:id="d19fn47">See telegram

                    <p>10. The telegram regarding the attitude which the United States should adopt
                        at the present time in respect to the abrogation of the capitulations in
                        Turkey was approved.</p>
                    <p>11. Part of the memorandum from Colonel Williams regarding Franco-American
                        relations was read, and the Commissioners stated they were getting awfully
                        tired of hearing just how strained relations were and that they would really
                        prefer to let the matter rest.</p>
                    <p>12. Memorandum No. 103 was read quoting a telegram which Admiral Benson
                        desires to send to the President regarding our present naval building
                        program. The Commissioners felt very strongly that it would be unwise to
                        send this telegram, in view of the fact that it would be most dangerous to
                        give it to the press, and in view of the fact that unless it were given to
                        the Press it would service [<hi rend="italic">serve</hi>] no purpose. The
                        Commissioners decided therefore that Mr. Lansing should speak to Admiral
                        Benson personally about the matter.</p>
                    <p>13. Mr. Herter read a memorandum prepared by Mr. Patchin requesting that he
                        be authorized to expend 1340 francs for certain type necessary to print good
                        proofs of the proces-verbales etc., for the Commission. The Commissioners
                        immediately stated that they would be glad to authorize Mr. Patchin’s
                        expending <hi rend="italic">any</hi> sum necessary for turning out legible
                        and well printed documents for the Commission.</p>
                    <p>14. Memorandum No. 104 was read and the attention of the Commissioners was
                        called to a telegram from Prof. Coolidge regarding certain demands which the
                        Italian Government was making on the German-Austrians, using as a threat to
                        force compliance with these demands the cutting off of food shipments.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners agreed that the action of the Italians in this matter was
                        intolerable, and that some way would have to be found to prevent the further
                        complete control of the Italians over the German-Austrian food supply. They
                        therefore heartily approved of the recommendation contained in Memorandum
                        No. 104, namely, that Mr. Hoover should be requested to suggest the measures
                        which should be taken in the premises.</p>
                    <p>15. Mr. Herter read a memorandum regarding certain statements which the
                        Delegates of the Ukrainian Republic had made to the President of the Peace
                        Conference. The Commissioners stated that they had already received this
                        information through certain data which General Bliss distributed containing
                        a full text of three notes which the Delegation in question had sent to M.
                        Clemenceau.</p>

                            Inter-Allied Food Commission, to which statement Mr. Lansing

                            further discussion and clarification of this article was made, an

                            “imposed by Germany”. Mr. Lansing declared that Mr. Balfour had stated
                            that it had not been imposed on England, and the two Commissioners
                            present united in declaring that it had not been imposed on the United
                            States. Mr. White and Mr. Lansing both felt that the only thing that
                            interested us in the treaty was the “open door”.</item>

                            the telegram when delivered stating that it was “garbled and delayed for

                            desirability of discussing the matter with the American Red Cross in

                            presence in Paris. Mr. Wilson raised the project that had been submitted
                            by the Austro-Hungarian Red Cross representatives in Switzerland as to
                            the use of Austro-Hungarian money in the hands of the Alien Property
                            Custodian for the relief of these prisoners. Mr. Lansing stated that
                            such procedure was impossible since the Alien Property Custodian could
                            not take such measures without an act of Congress authorizing him to
                            take that step.</item>

                    <p>1. Dr. Bliss of the American College in Beirut, Syria, was called in. He
                        declared that Syria was a small country, but that the principle involved was
                        clear cut and one which affected the honor of the United States and her
                        allies. Syria is depending on the Article of the President’s declaration
                        concerning the right of self-determination of race, and specifically of the
                        twelfth point which refers to the Turkish affairs. France also made a
                        declaration in November 1918,<note n="50" xml:id="d21fn50">Reference is
                            apparently to British and French joint declaration quoted in telegram
                            No. 226, November 25, 1918, from the Diplomatic Agent and Consul General
                            at Cairo, <ref target="frus1919Parisv02#pg_274">vol. <hi
                                    rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, p. 274</ref>.</note> of which Dr.
                        Bliss sketched the history, which they now seem to be ignoring. Dr. Bliss
                        urged strongly the sending of an inter-Allied Commission for examination of
                        this matter, whatever might be its findings, it would satisfy the demands of
                        honor. Mr. Lansing stated that he had made the same proposal but that it had
                        been refused by Pichon under orders from Clemenceau. Mr. Lansing declared
                        himself ready to <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0113"/>press the matter
                        providing he was sure of British assistance. Dr. Bliss replied that Mr.
                        Balfour was in favor of the project. Mr. Lansing assured Dr. Bliss that the
                        affair would not go by default, and that when it is seen that definite
                        action is contemplated in regard to Syria it will be time to make a protest.
                        The Commissioners are considering carefully what is proper. Dr. Bliss
                        declared that the country should certainly not be handed over before the
                        wishes of the people were consulted, and both the Commissioners agreed. Dr.
                        Bliss stated that a Syrian from Lebanon, a representative man, had declared
                        to him that the Syrians would unanimously favor America for the mandatory
                        power. The same statement has been made to him by other persons from Syria.
                        Mr. White inquired how the Commission in Syria could get a comprehensive
                        view of the situation, because of the propaganda of both the British and
                        French. Dr. Bliss replied it was difficult, but not impossible. Men must be
                        selected of character and dignity. He declared that if it was impossible to
                        send an inter-Allied Commission, he strongly recommended that an American
                        Commission go out which could talk freely to all classes of Syrians. He was
                        not in favor of calling for Syrians to come to Paris, since how could the
                        proper men be chosen. … Mr. Lansing informed him that no decision was
                        imminent. (Dr. Bliss withdrew.)</p>
                    <p>2. Mr. Hoover entered. Mr. Hoover stated that at Triest he had been able to
                        accumulate 80 or 90 thousand tons of food stuffs, and had been endeavoring
                        for over a month to get it inland for distribution, but that he was meeting
                        with the most constant and irritating obstruction, strikes, lack of railway
                        accommodations etc. He has now been informed that the day before yesterday
                        the Italians severed all connection with the Jugo-Slavs, and that
                        practically a state of war exists, due to incidents at Laibach. The Italians
                        have declared that they cannot, therefore, move any further quantities of
                        food from Triest but will endeavor to move four trains a day through Tyrol
                        to Austria. This would place in the country about 20% of the necessary food,
                        and might take care of the immediate needs only of Vienna and the
                        Czecho-Slovaks. Mr. Lansing asked what recommendation he made to stop this
                        condition of affairs, and Mr. Hoover replied that it could be stopped by
                        informing the Italians that they would get no more food from the United
                        States unless they facilitated the operation of the relief administration.
                        He desires to have the means of management in his hands, definite rolling
                        stock and right of transportation. He declares that what rolling stock has
                        been demanded from Austria should be immediately handed over to the
                        relief.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing inquired whether Mr. Hoover had already threatened the Italians.
                        Mr. Hoover replied that he was not in a position to threaten, but that he
                        had pointed out the very painful impression <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78"
                            facs="0114"/>that such action would make, and the conviction that it
                        would persuade the American people that the whole question of the Adriatic
                        countries, including Italy, should be abandoned and they should be left to
                        settle their own affairs. Mr. Hoover stated that he had listened in the
                        Supreme Economic Council to Mr. Crespi<note n="51" xml:id="d21fn51">Of the
                            Italian delegation.</note> who wept over the Italian economic
                        conditions, but that this kind of thing was not getting anybody anywhere.
                        Mr. Lansing inquired what definite steps Mr. Hoover had to propose. Mr.
                        Hoover proposed a telegram to the President explaining the case, and
                        recommending that food be stopped to Italy unless necessary facilities are
                        given to Mr. Hoover to carry out his work. Mr. Lansing stated that a
                        telegram of such importance should be shown to all the Commissioners, and
                        requested Mr. Hoover to draw up and furnish him with such a telegram. Mr.
                        Hoover then explained the difficulties he had encountered in obtaining
                        recognition for his Commission in Triest. Mr. White remarked that the
                        Italians have a genius for obstruction. Mr. Lansing suggested, without
                        insisting upon the point of view, that a telegram be drafted for the
                        President and shown to Mr. Sonnino with the intimation that unless matters
                        were remedied it would be sent to the President. Mr. Hoover replied that he
                        had already sent one of his best men to Rome where he could explain the
                        situation to Mr. Orlando, and that he encountered the same policy of
                        obstruction.</p>
                    <p>3. Mr. Hoover stated that he was prevented by law from feeding Vienna, and
                        that people were daily dying there from starvation. He hopes that by
                        allowing somebody else to make the payment he can get food to that city.
                        Some 25,000 tons of food at Triest could be sold to the Italians under the
                        understanding that it should be shipped to Vienna. Mr. Hoover acknowledged a
                        certain inconsistency between this project and the ideas he had developed
                        above, and added that Italian security itself was not satisfactory, but that
                        politically it was important that food should reach Vienna to prevent an
                        explosion which otherwise might be anticipated within a week.</p>
                    <p>4. Mr. Hoover then introduced the subject of food agreements with the Polish
                        Government. He inquired from Mr. Lansing whether it was preferable that
                        contracts with the Polish Government should be drawn up through the State
                        Department. Mr. Lansing replied that he thought the War Trade Board. He
                        believed that contracts might be drawn up in the name of the relief
                        organization but not of the American Government, and that Mr. Hoover should
                        have legal counsel on the subject. Mr. Hoover stated that the contract would
                        have a form somewhat as follows: <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0115"/>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The Polish Government having applied for certain food stuffs, and
                                the Allied Governments having declared their intention of furnishing
                                such provisions, and the United States having created a Relief
                                Administration, this Administration has found it possible to set
                                aside certain quantities for Poland.”</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>Mr. Hoover pointed out that this involves a certain recognition of the Polish
                        Government, and Mr. Lansing replied that such recognition had already been
                        accorded.</p>
                    <p>5. Mr. Hoover continued by stating that the question of shipments to Riga,
                        Libau and other points in the Baltic provinces was more complicated, but the
                        Livonia problem was very difficult. Mr. Lansing suggested that Mr. Hoover
                        consult Major Dulles who had had large experience in similar cases on the
                        War Trade Board. There was also a difficulty Mr. Hoover declared in
                        shipments to Armenia, but Mr. Lansing pointed out that the Congressional act
                        especially mentioned Armenian relief and therefore contracts could be
                        created without danger.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hoover withdrew.</p>
                    <p>6. Mr. Wilson stated that Major Whitridge<note n="51a" xml:id="d21fn51a"
                            >Arnold Whitridge, of the Gherardi Mission to Germany.</note> had just
                        returned from Berlin via Munich and was waiting to see whether the
                        Commission desired to receive him. Mr. Lansing stated they would try to
                        receive him tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>7. Mr. Wilson presented Memorandum No. 107 concerning the secret agreements
                        which Japan had persuaded certain European powers to sign, pledging their
                        support for Japanese claims in certain islands of the Pacific, and special
                        rights in the province of Shantung. Mr. Lansing stated he already had these
                        documents, and Mr. White requested that it should be ascertained whether
                        these documents had been delivered to him as he had not seen them.</p>
                    <p>[8.] Mr. Wilson introduced Memorandum No. 108 concerning the proposed
                        portrait of the Commission. Both Mr. Lansing and Mr. White declared that
                        they were not in favor of making a recommendation to the State Department in
                        this matter, and they desired to be informed where the work of these
                        gentlemen who had proposed their services could be seen on exhibition.</p>
                    <p>9. Mr. Wilson informed the Commissioners that Mr. Grew had consulted Dr.
                        Bliss and Prof. Westermann concerning the question of the reliable American
                        observer to be sent to Syria.</p>
                    <p>10. Memorandum No. 109 was introduced concerning the telegram to J. L.
                        Barton, and the despatch of this telegram was approved by the
                        Commission.</p>

                        <item>General Bliss stated that in the case of Lieut. Voska there was really
                            no evidence against him. Lieut. Voska had submitted that he was acting
                            under orders from Mr. Sisson<note n="52" xml:id="d22fn52">Of the
                                Committee on Public Information.</note> to investigate a report
                            showing connivance on the part of the German and Austro-Hungarian
                            governments in the murder at Sarajevo. Mr. Lansing discussed Mr. Sisson
                            and his part in the publication of the Bolshevik documents tending to
                            show that Lenine and Trotsky had been in German pay.<note n="53"

                            that Mr. Sisson was a dangerous person. Mr. Lansing suggested to General

                            commutation of quarters, and suggested that it be adopted with the

                            February 1, 1919”. The Commission thereupon approved the entire

                        <item>General Bliss stated that yesterday they had finished discussion on
                            the armament affair. That Marshal Foch had stated that he would accept
                            nothing to which General Bliss made reserves. A new draft was
                            accordingly drawn up to which General Bliss agreed, declaring however,
                            that the political consequences thereof were outside his province and
                            must be judged by those competent. This agreement was returned to
                            Marshal Foch, and later General Bliss was informed that an amendment had
                            been made to it. General Bliss found that the amendment contained a
                            rider which by its reading gave the possibility of perpetual control.
                            Thereupon it was revised, and Marshal Foch will consult the Allies for
                            their approval. General Bliss expected opposition to it. It will
                            subsequently be reported to the Council.</item>

                        <item>Mr. Lansing read from the minutes of the Council meeting on Monday
                            last concerning Mr. Pichon’s declaration that the preliminary conditions
                            were not preliminary peace terms.<note n="54" xml:id="d22fn54">See
                                BC–38, minute 1 (b), <ref target="frus1919Parisv04#pg_102">vol. <hi
                                        rend="smallcaps">iv</hi>, p. 102</ref>.</note> Mr. Pichon
                            explained that the conditions would in reality form part of the
                            armistice <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0117"/>and not part of the
                            peace terms, pointing out the necessity, if they were peace terms of
                            their being submitted to the United States Senate for ratification. Mr.
                            Lansing felt that only the final form of a peace document had to be
                            submitted to the Senate, but that conditions which included economic and
                            territorial terms constituted in effect a peace treaty which should be
                            submitted to the Senate. Mr. Lansing stated that on Tuesday he asked Mr.
                            Pichon whether in reality he considered these preliminary conditions as
                            an extension of the armistice or as part of the peace treaty. Mr. Pichon
                            replied that he considered them an extension of the terms of the
                            armistice. He thereupon called Marshal Foch by telephone, who took the
                            contrary point of view. Mr. Lansing pointed out that the nature of the
                            terms would make it obligatory that the Senate ratify it. General Bliss
                            declared that he and General Pershing had agreed to a draft providing
                            for: one, reduction of the German army; two, reduction of armaments;
                            three, prohibitory terms; four, provision for control by a military
                            commission in Germany. General Bliss pointed out that the Senate would
                            probably make objections to the participation by American officers in a
                            commission for perpetual control. General Bliss declared that he and
                            General Pershing only, therefore, agreed to such a commission as would
                            exist for a limited period of time to oversee the execution of those
                            things which can be promptly carried out. General Bliss states the
                            others have now receded from their position. Mr. Lansing called
                            attention to the changed attitude in this matter of the French military
                            authorities who now prefer a definite peace rather than a continuation
                            of the armistice, Marshal Foch being uneasy about the condition in the
                            French army. General Bliss stated that Marshal Foch had declared himself
                            fully in accord with an immediate peace. Mr. White stated that it was
                            the intention to have an immediate peace. General Bliss stated that Mr.
                                Swope<note n="55" xml:id="d22fn55">Herbert Bayard Swope, of the New
                                York <hi rend="italic">World.</hi></note> informed him that in an
                            interview with Colonel House, the latter stated that those military,
                            naval and air conditions which are included in the preliminary treaty
                            will be included in the final terms. General Bliss is in accord with
                            this. Mr. Lansing stated that it was this desire for early peace that
                            induced the Council to call for reports on March 8th. Mr. Lansing is now
                            working on the final draft. He added that Mr. Pichon declared that they
                            were inserting in the armistice terms conditions to be incorporated
                            later in the peace terms. Mr. Lansing, however, believes that it is
                            really a preliminary peace and not armistice. Mr. White stated the idea
                            now was to make peace with Germany, letting the Italian and other
                            matters wait. Mr. Lansing stated that this was correct, but that the
                            same resolutions had been adopted for each one of the <pb n="82"
                                xml:id="pg_82" facs="0118"/>enemy powers, but had been adopted
                            separately which will enable separate action. Mr. White stated that the
                            treaty with Germany must then be ratified by the Senate before peace
                            could be declared by the President. General Bliss declared that the fact
                            that the United States was now sending home 200,000 men per month and
                            would shortly begin to send 300,000 was the factor that was inducing the
                            others to hurry.</item>

                            assistance for General Kernan. General Bliss declared that he would
                            discuss this matter with General Pershing, and the Commission therefore
                            referred the matter to General Bliss.</item>

                        <item>Mr. Wilson stated that Mr. Hoover had requested him to explain to the
                            Commission that the bank at Helsingfors, the National Bank of Finland,
                            has 14 million dollars on deposit in New York. In view of the frequent
                            changes of government in Finland, the banks are unwilling to accept
                            checks signed by the treasurer of the Bank of Helsingfors, unless the
                            American authorities will declare that this treasurer now officiating
                            has the right to draw such drafts. Mr. Hoover urges strongly that
                            recognition be granted to the Government of Finland so that this money
                            may be drawn for food which is immediately necessary to relieve the
                            critical food condition of that country. Mr. Wilson added that he had
                            brought up the matter with Colonel House and that Colonel House approved
                            favorable action. The Commission decided to request from Mr. Dolbeare a
                            complete report with recommendations to be presented at the earliest
                            possible moment concerning the matter of the recognition of
                            Finland.</item>

                            Benson, Mr. Sharp and General Pershing. That Mr. Lansing and Mr. Sharp
                            were asked to give short speeches for the American Delegation. Mr.
                            Lansing stated he would consult with Colonel House in regard to the

                    <p>1. General Bliss read a letter which he had addressed to the Commissioners
                        concerning conclusions which he had reached as a result of his discussions
                        with the allied colleagues. He believes that there are plans for continued
                        military operations after the war, and that these plans include help from
                        the United States. There is reason to believe, and this reason is given
                        foundation by Marshal Foch’s declarations at the Supreme War Council that it
                        is a plan to align the border states of Russia in a war against Russia under
                        French direction. General Bliss’ letter points out that all of the
                        continental states of Europe are bankrupt, and England would become bankrupt
                        if she endeavored to participate in such a war. Therefore, this plan depends
                        on American financial assistance. This explains the insistence that some
                        American soldiers should be sent to Dantzig, although the ostensible reason
                        is the maintenance of communication with Thorn for deliveries of supplies
                        and despatch of troops to Poland. General Bliss’ letter states that the
                        newly created states of Central Europe are bending every effort to raise
                        large armaments, while Germany is extremely anxious to reduce its armaments.
                        With the best intention in the world, the American philanthropic schemes for
                        the new countries are enabling those countries to spend so much more on
                        military preparation, and by so much are contributing to the preparation for
                        a new continental explosion. The letter urges a statement from America,
                        inoffensive in tone but positive, of the real purpose of America when peace
                        is concluded. The declaration should state that America will withdraw its
                        military forces on the signature of peace, and that all assistance in
                        credits and supplies will be stopped except that which follows the dictates
                        of the humanitarian impulses of the people. The French know that the United
                        States is necessary in any future war against Germany. They regard the
                        League of Nations as a dream, but the friendship of the United States as a
                        reality. The letter concludes with the recommendation that the Commissioners
                        consider carefully whether they can do anything in this matter. Mr. White
                        stated that he had the same conviction, and suggested that a telegram should
                        be sent to the President. Mr. Lansing suggested that the statement should
                        include the declaration that we intended to cooperate <pb n="84"
                            xml:id="pg_84" facs="0120"/>through the League of Nations and not
                        otherwise. General Bliss considered that it would be highly advantageous for
                        the President to ascertain while at home the attitude of Congress toward the
                        sending of American troops to Poland, Czecho-Slovakia and elsewhere. It was
                        agreed that General Bliss would draft a telegram which he would submit to
                        the Commissioners.</p>
                    <p>2. Mr. Wilson introduced the matter of the telegrams from Admiral McCully at
                        Murmansk requesting naval assistance.<note n="58" xml:id="d23fn58">See <ref

                                    Relations</hi>, 1919, Russia, p. 619</ref>.</note> General Bliss
                        recalled to the memory of the Commissioners that he had sent a letter some
                        days ago concerning the despatch to Archangel of American railway troops,
                        pointing out that it was necessary for the troops to make construction over
                        the frozen swamps during the winter months to maintain supplies, and
                        facilitate the withdrawal of the troops in the Spring. General Bliss stated
                        that the President had approved this matter, and that the British also
                        wished to withdraw. There is, therefore, no doubt that the President
                        believes that the withdrawal should be made. General Bliss then sketched the
                        geographical and military situation, and answered Mr. Lansing’s question in
                        regard to the possibility of getting the boats to Archangel by stating that
                        they would probably blast the ice, and that in any case the ice might be
                        broken and small boats could get through. He urges that all assistance be
                        given which is necessary to facilitate the withdrawal in the Spring. Mr.
                        Lansing suggested that General Bliss talk to Admiral Benson in the name of
                        the Commission along the lines indicated above. Mr. Lansing added that he
                        regretted the obligation to desert the Russian troops which rallied to us
                        even though they were few in number. Criticism was then expressed of British
                        methods in handling expeditions. Mr. Wilson handed the papers in the case to
                        General Bliss.</p>
                    <p>[There is an apparent omission in the text of the minutes at this point.]
                        named Secretary to the American Delegation to Prinkipo was now in Paris and
                        requested an expression of opinion from the Commissioners as to what should
                        be told him as to the projected trip. Mr. Lansing inquired for details
                        concerning Mr. Phelps which were supplied by Mr. White, who gave a high
                        recommendation to Mr. Phelps. Mr. Lansing suggested that Mr. Phelps be
                        retained in Mr. Grew’s political department, as there was need for trained
                        men since that department was overwhelmed with work. Mr. Phelps can be
                        informed that he will be retained until final determination of the Prinkipo
                        affair.</p>
                    <p>4. Mr. White stated that Mr. Tardieu had announced that the Prinkipo matter
                        was definitely off and asked the advice of the Commission as to what to tell
                        the press when questioned about it. Mr. Lansing <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85"
                            facs="0121"/>advised Mr. White to state that the matter had not reached
                        a final conclusion.</p>
                    <p>5. Mr. Wilson introduced Memorandum No. 111 concerning Mr. McCormick’s
                        telegram to the President urging the latter to return to France via Antwerp,
                        visiting the devastated districts en route to Paris.<note n="59"
                            xml:id="d23fn59"><hi rend="italic">Post</hi>, <ref target="#pg_516">p.
                                516</ref>.</note> Mr. White was entirely in favor of despatching
                        such a telegram to urge the same matter, and declared that he had repeatedly
                        seen that the French were dissatisfied that the President had not made such
                        a trip. Mr. Lansing stated that in such a recommendation it was essential to
                        have the approval of everyone of the Commissioners. General Bliss pointed
                        out that the trip to Antwerp might be more dangerous than to France because
                        of floating mines. Mr. Lansing requested Mr. Wilson to draft a telegram on
                        this subject, adding the point that it would be a relief to the French
                        government from the embarrassing position of being obliged to give another
                        official reception to the President. General Bliss will speak to Admiral
                        Benson in regard to the point of the danger involved.</p>
                    <p>6. Mr. Wilson introduced Memorandum No. 112 concerning the note from the
                        French Foreign Office to the American Embassy in Paris regarding German
                        ships in neutral ports. It was agreed by the Commissioners that no action
                        should be taken in this matter as it was an affair for the Department of
                        State to handle. If Mr. Polk subsequently desires their advice he will ask
                        for it.</p>
                    <p>7. Mr. Wilson introduced Memorandum No. 113 concerning the note from the
                        British Ambassador regarding the despatch of troops to Montenegro. The
                        Commissioners did not care to have the note read.</p>
                    <p>8. Mr. Wilson introduced Memorandum No. 114 concerning Mr. Patchin’s
                        statement in regard to the bill for visiting cards for official members of
                        the Commission. The Commissioners desire a further and more detailed
                        statement in regard to this bill. This statement should show a list of those
                        persons for whom the cards were purchased and other pertinent
                        information.</p>
                    <p>9. Mr. Wilson introduced Memorandum No. 115 concerning the suggestion of the
                        Diplomatic Agent at Cairo relative to the sending of Consul Jackson and
                        other Consular officers to Syria and Palestine. The Commissioners desire
                        that Mr. Gary should be informed that this is a Departmental matter and that
                        his telegram has been referred to the Acting Secretary of State, and that
                        the telegram should be repeated to the Department of State with the
                        information added that Mr. Gary has been advised.</p>
                    <p>10. Mr. Wilson introduced Memorandum No. 116 concerning “Constantinople as
                        Headquarters for American Red Cross Work in the <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86"
                            facs="0122"/>Balkan States.” The Commissioners approved the despatch of
                        the suggested telegram with the elimination of the last words “Does
                        Department approve” and the insertion of the words “If you agree suggest you
                        telegraph Heck in Constantinople and notify Red Cross”.</p>
                    <p>11. Mr. Wilson introduced Memorandum No. 117 concerning Prof. Day’s
                        communication in regard to the Committee which is studying Greek territorial
                        claims. The Commissioners requested that Prof. Day present a concise
                        memorandum on the questions at issue which they can study and determine
                        whether they desire to call Prof. Day for an explanation.</p>

                            Harrison answered in the affirmative. Mr. Lansing thought this would be

                            answer to General Bliss’ request based on Monsieur Noulens’

                            stated that he believed this would clear up the atmosphere as it would
                            give an opportunity to explain why the troops were not immediately

                        <label>14.</label>
                        <item>General Bliss declared that Mr. Dresel had discussed with him the
                            question of the union of German-Austria with Germany, and had left with
                            him a memorandum of a projected pronouncement of <pb n="88"
                                xml:id="pg_88" facs="0124"/>the Council of Ten. Mr. White pointed
                            out that the project was so worded that it would not conflict with the
                            principle of the right of self determination of nationalities, but was
                            merely a warning intended to influence the Austrian Constituent
                            Assembly, and to prevent the possibility of the Conference being
                            requested to take subsequent, action contrary to the President’s
                            principles. Mr. Lansing stated that he did not know what America’s
                            attitude was towards this union, and that he felt that any idea of
                            preventing an eventual union between the German peoples was a dream. He
                            expressed an interest in the project of the union between Bavaria and
                            German-Austria.</item>
                        <label>15.</label>
                        <item>General Bliss introduced the matter of the boundary discussions and
                            the part that Colonel Miles had played in delimitating a frontier, and
                            was of the opinion that Colonel Miles should be kept as far as possible
                            out of the discussion. Mr. Lansing believed that Colonel Miles’ part
                            should be minimized as much as possible, and that they were trying to
                            save Colonel Miles and Prof. Coolidge in this matter. General Bliss
                            suggested that he might declare that the mission in Austria was
                            reporting on this matter of the frontiers, that it was making an
                            impersonal investigation which perhaps might have a different result
                            from that which the Commission might decide.</item>

                        <item>The Commissioners discussed briefly the proposed military terms to be
                            imposed on Germany and the attitude which the American delegates should
                            assume on this question. General Bliss stated that he would be present
                            at the afternoon meeting of the Council, when the terms would be
                            considered.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Lansing read a communication from Mr. Baruch regarding the
                            necessity of the formation of a special committee to draft the
                            commercial provisions of the various treaties which the United States
                            would have to conclude with the countries with which commercial
                            relations have been broken. Mr. Baruch suggested that Mr. Taussig be
                            requested to proceed to Paris to take charge of this work, and that Dr.
                            A. A. Young and Mr. Miller should work on the problem <pb n="89"
                                xml:id="pg_89" facs="0125"/>of drafting such economic treaties
                            pending Mr. Taussig’s arrival. Mr. Lansing mentioned Mr. Gay as a man
                            who would be most useful for this work and said that if the other
                            Commissioners approved he would discuss the matter with Mr. McCormick
                            before a final decision was reached. This was agreed to by Mr. White and
                            General Bliss. Mr. Lansing remarked that the drafting of new commercial
                            treaties with Germany and the Austro-Hungary states was a very delicate
                            matter, which would require the most expert assistance. He remarked that
                            the United States never had had satisfactory commercial treaties with
                            Germany.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Mr. White brought up M. Pichon’s suggestion regarding the “financial
                            section” of the League of Nations. He remarked that this was merely a
                            French method of putting through the idea of “pooling” the cost of the
                            war. The Commissioners were unanimous that any project of this nature
                            was utterly inacceptable to the United States, which would be forced to
                            pay a disproportionate share of the pool and receive a very small
                            proportion of the proceeds.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Mr. White read a telegram which had been received from the naval
                            authorities regarding the proposal that the President land at Antwerp.
                            This telegram mentioned that while the mine fields in the English
                            Channel were largely cleared up, there was still some danger from mines,
                            and that the navigation of the Scheldt was as yet very difficult for a
                            vessel of the size of the “George Washington”. The naval authorities
                            recommended that if the President made the trip as contemplated, he
                            should land at Flushing and proceed by destroyer to Antwerp. The
                            Commissioners were unanimous in the decision that they could not assume
                            the responsibility for advising the President to take a trip which
                            involved an element of danger. Mr. Lansing pointed out that it would be
                            out of the question to touch at Flushing, which was Dutch
                            territory.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>The Commissioners noted the selection of Lt. Colonel Olds as liaison
                            officer between the Commission and the American Red Cross. Mr. Lansing
                            remarked that he knew Colonel Olds personally, and added that he had
                            recently been selected as head of the Red Cross in Europe.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>With reference to Admiral Benson’s request for instructions regarding
                            the passage of German troops by sea to Libau, General Bliss remarked
                            that he had just discussed the matter with Admiral Benson, who was on
                            his way to a conference in which this matter was up for discussion. The
                            Commissioners decided that no action should be taken until Admiral
                            Benson had reported what had taken place in this conference. The
                            attention of the Commissioners was called to the statements of Bear
                            Admiral Robison and Captain Gherardi that the Germans would endeavor to
                            take advantage of any aid they might give in checking the Bolsheviks by
                            demanding compensation at the <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0126"
                            />Peace Conference. The Commissioners discussed briefly the attitude of
                            Germany towards the Bolsheviks and remarked that with the present
                            internal condition of Germany it was out of the question for her to play
                            Bolshevism against the Allies, as she herself was most nearly threatened
                            by this danger.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>The Commissioners noted Mr. McCormick’s request that officers of
                            General McKinstry’s staff be retained for work with the Claims
                            Sub-Committee of the Reparation Commission, and approved Mr. McCormick’s
                            request for the eight officers mentioned, with the understanding that
                            their services would not be required for a protracted period.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>The Commissioners approved Mr. Stabler’s request to be permitted to
                            entertain representatives of Latin American countries at the expense of
                            the Commission. A similar request from Lt. Noble to be granted
                            facilities for entertaining French journalists, etc., was also approved
                            under the conditions noted by Lt. Noble, namely that four guests a week
                            should not be exceeded. It was suggested that both Mr. Stabler and Lt.
                            Noble in submitting the statement of expenses incurred in this way,
                            should give the Secretary General the names of the persons entertained
                            by them.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>The Commissioners discussed a memorandum which outlined the objections
                            to the union of German Austria with Germany, and Mr. Dulles explained
                            the arguments against a “laisser faire” policy on this question. After
                            some discussion Mr. Lansing remarked that if the question of opposing
                            the union was brought up by one of the Allies it might well be
                            considered, but that he could not approve of America’s taking the
                            initiative in this question of a European territorial settlement,
                            especially in view of the fact that such an initiative might appear to
                            be in contradiction to the President’s principles.</item>

                            yesterday come to see him in order to ascertain whether it would not be
                            possible for the head of the Siamese Delegation to have a short <pb
                                n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0127"/>interview with Mr. Lansing, in
                            which he might submit a memorandum in regard to Siamese aspirations. Mr.
                            White explained that the granting of such an interview would be a source
                            of deep gratification to the Siamese government. Mr. Lansing agreed to
                            see the Delegate in question and asked that an engagement be made for
                            him.</item>

                        <item>Mr. White recounted an interview which he and General Bliss had held
                            with the Arch-Bishop of Spalato in regard to the whole Dalmatian
                            question. Evidently the Arch-Bishop had made a very strong case and had
                            convincingly expounded the folly of allowing Italy to take possession of
                            Fiume or the islands of the Dalmatian coast.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Mr. White observed that he had had a long conversation with Mr.
                            Coromilas of the Greek Delegation yesterday, indicating that the latter
                            was much upset over the alleged American attitude respecting the Greeks
                            of Asia Minor and the Dodecanese Islands. Mr. White read a memorandum of
                            the statements which Mr. Westermann had made during a meeting of the
                            Commission charged with the study of the Greek claims in regard to the
                            attitude of the United States. This statement indicated that the only
                            thing to which the Greek Delegation might take exception in our attitude
                            was the declaration that in our opinion the coast of Asia Minor should
                            not be separated, from an administrative point of view, from Hinterland.
                            Mr. White went on to explain that Mr. Venizelos, who [<hi rend="italic"
                                >sic</hi>] is coming to discuss this matter with him this afternoon,
                            and asked what attitude he should adopt. Mr. Lansing and General Bliss
                            both agreed that Mr. Westermann’s statements of the case had been
                            perfectly correct and that Mr. White could properly tell Mr. Venizelos
                            that our general view was that no Hinterland can properly be separated
                            from the coast, but that of course we were still willing to leave this
                            matter open to debate.</item>

                        <item>Mr. White read a memorandum which had been presented yesterday by the
                            French Delegates on the Commission for the International Regime of
                            Ports, Waterways and Railways, regarding France’s claims with respect to
                            the Rhine. Mr. White stated that inasmuch as this memorandum was
                            practically a demand on Germany to sign a blank check with regard to her
                            rights on the Rhine, he felt that the American Delegates on this
                            Committee should take a very strong stand against it. Mr. Lansing and
                            General Bliss both asked for copies of the French proposal and stated
                            that they would be glad to give Mr. White their opinion as soon as they
                            had had an opportunity of studying it.</item>

                        <item>Mr. Lansing read a letter which had been sent to him by Mr. Norman
                            Davis regarding the appointment of an additional representative to the
                            Financial Commission, and of a financial representative on the Economic
                            Committee. It was decided that Mr. Davis should be appointed as the
                            additional American representative on the Financial Commission and Mr.
                            Thomas W. Lamont as the financial <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0128"
                            />representative on the Economic Committee. Mr. Herter was asked to have

                        <item>Mr. Lansing spoke of the Committee on which he was now serving, which
                            was endeavoring hard to have the Kaiser tried. He explained that he was
                            in rather an uncomfortable position in this matter as he stood alone
                            against the other representatives on the Commission against having the
                            Kaiser tried by a tribunal. He was willing to have a court of inquiry
                            pass upon the case, but was not willing to let it go further. General
                            Bliss and Mr. White agreed that a court of inquiry might in this
                            connection bring out some useful information in regard to the obscure
                            beginnings of the war, but that the actual trial of the Kaiser could not
                            take place before a tribunal.</item>

                            of the Serbian and Rumanian troops in the Banat. It was agreed that in
                            view of Mr. Laroche’s<note n="60" xml:id="d26fn60">French representative

                            to secure complete reports of the action which the French army of the
                            Orient had taken in this matter no further steps need be taken at

                        <item>Mr. Herter read Memorandum No. 126 inquiring whether the Commissioners
                            desire to have Lieut. Paukstas assigned to Paris for duty with the
                            Lithuanian National Council. The Commissioners were unable to understand
                            exactly why we should be asked to have Lieut. Paukstas assigned to Paris
                            and to pay his expenses while in Paris for the sake of the Lithuanian
                            National Council or Commission. Furthermore, the Commissioners were not
                            sure that we should take this step and thereby become indirectly
                            responsible for Lieut. Paukstas’ connection with a Lithuanian body.
                            However, as this whole matter appears to be rather obscure and as the
                            exact status of the Lithuanian National Council as well as our relation
                            to it are not quite clear, the Commissioners desire a full explanation
                            of the whole case before taking definitive action.</item>

                        <item>Information Memorandum No. 26 was read in regard to the formation of a
                            Committee of from three to five members to assist in establishing better
                            relations between the American and French press. The Commissioners
                            discussed this matter at some length and felt that although the French
                            press attacks against the President and America had perhaps not been
                            inspired, nevertheless it was a strange coincidence that when the rumor
                            was spread about that the President might ask to have the seat of the
                            conference changed to some other country all attacks suddenly stopped.
                            They felt that taking all in all such a Committee as was suggested might
                            be cumbersome and that it would really be better to let matters take
                            their regular course. They therefore desire that action on this
                            memorandum be suspended for the present or until such a time as the
                            situation became more acute.</item>

                            post in Berlin. The Commissioners agreed that it would be well to have
                            Mr. Day come back to Paris and report at once, but at the same time
                            thought that he should bring Schumacher<note n="62" xml:id="d26fn62"

                            changes, the Commissioners feeling that it would be well to leave in the
                            last sentence as the Germans could then under no conditions attribute
                            Mr. Day’s withdrawal to lack of faith on our part in their power to keep
                            order, but rather to a desire to have a report from him.</item>

                    <p>1. Mr. Lansing explained the great difficulties which he had encountered on
                        his sub-committee to determine the responsibility for the war. At the
                        request of the American Delegation a drafting committee had submitted to
                        this Commission a report proposing that military commissions be established
                        to try cases for violations of the laws of war. At first the British
                        Delegates did not approve of such a scheme but had finally given in at the
                        insistence of the American delegates. The British had desired that a
                        tribunal be established on which all the different nations concerned should
                        be represented, which should try individuals, including the ex-Kaiser of
                        Germany. This proposal Mr. Lansing had been unable to agree to particularly
                        as it had involved the trial of individuals for acts committed before the
                        United States entered the war. He had therefore stated that the United
                        States could not entertain such a project. The British Delegate had
                        evidently been displeased by the American point of view as expressed by Mr.
                        Lansing and therefore withdrew his consent to the establishing of military
                        commissions as suggested by Mr. Lansing. Owing to this impasse Mr. Lansing
                        stated that he would withdraw the American member of the Drafting Committee
                        because the American wishes in <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0130"/>this
                        matter seemed to be completely overlooked. Immediately after this statement
                        the French and Italian Delegates as well as the Delegates from Greece and
                        Rumania attempted to smooth matters over and suggested a compromise between
                        the British and the American points of view. This was the first time that a
                        wedge had been driven between the French and British, who had so far stood
                        solidly together on this whole question. It was Mr. Lansing’s opinion that
                        the British Delegates were not very sincere in their desire to try the
                        Kaiser etc., but merely felt that they had to urge this measure because of a
                        political pledge. The situation was much the same as it had been on the
                        Reparations Committee where both the French and British were trying to
                        accomplish the impossible, knowing that it was impossible, but wishing to
                        place the blame for the failure upon the United States.</p>
                    <p>2. Colonel House stated that he had gone to see Mr. Clemenceau yesterday in
                        regard to the very serious situation in Germany. He had told Mr. Clemenceau
                        that we were directly responsible for letting this situation come upon us,
                        and that America had foreseen it and had warned the other associated
                        nations. Mr. Clemenceau observed that from the information he was now
                        receiving from Germany the situation was much as Colonel House had described
                        it. In regard to sending food and raw materials into Germany, however, Mr.
                        Clemenceau felt that French public opinion was not yet prepared for such a
                        step. It would, however, be willing to have food sent into German-Austria,
                        and Mr. Clemenceau therefore had decided that this matter should be taken up
                        at the Quai d’Orsay this afternoon when pressure would be brought upon Italy
                        to allow the food stuffs to get into German-Austria. Mr. Clemenceau was of
                        the opinion, however, that in two or three days French public opinion would
                        sanction the rendering of certain assistance to Bavaria at least, if not to
                        other parts of Germany, and then the ways and means could be discussed at
                        the Quai d’Orsay.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing read a portion of a memorandum which he had written in October
                        1918, which was a complete prophecy of what would happen in Central Europe
                        unless the United States rendered assistance with food and raw material.</p>
                    <p>3. The Commissioners agreed that we were being put in rather an uncomfortable
                        position by appearing to have to defend Germany, but that it was necessary
                        for us to adopt this position. They are convinced that public opinion in
                        America would stand behind them in this if the true situation were only
                        known. In this connection they felt that Mr. White had done much to change
                        the point of view of Mr. Wickersham, the correspondent of the <hi
                            rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi> who had just lately returned to the
                        United States with a very different outlook on the position of our Peace
                        Commission from that whiqh he had previously held.</p>
                    <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0131"/>
                    <p>The Commissioners felt at the same time that in spite of the alleged
                        resolution that had been brought up in the Senate, public opinion in the
                        United States was very favorable to the League of Nations. This opinion,
                        Colonel House observed, was confirmed by Mr. Melville Stone of the
                        Associated Press, who is very familiar with public opinion in the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing felt very strongly that in view of the fact that many of the
                        tangles now arising were due to the original armistice terms, it would be
                        necessary for us sooner or later to have it known in the United States that
                        from the beginning the United States had demanded absolute demobilization of
                        Germany. In this connection, General Bliss’ memorandum of October 28<note

                        it was even thought by the Commissioners that at some time in the near
                        future it would be advisable to give out the substance of this
                        memorandum.</p>
                    <p>Colonel House withdrew.</p>
                    <p>4. Mr. Herter read Memorandum No. 127 regarding the assignment of Mr. J. B.
                        Umpleby to the Commission. The Commissioners agreed that Mr. Umpleby’s
                        services would be very valuable on the Commission, and therefore were
                        willing to approve the payment of his expenses as well as a salary of about
                        $300 per month by the Commission.</p>
                    <p>5. Mr. Herter read Memorandum No. 128 embodying Mr. Norman H. Davis’ request
                        that Captain F. S. Colt be assigned to the Commission because of his
                        previous experience with the Farmer’s Loan &amp; Trust Company, and his
                        consequent utility in the Financial Department. The Commissioners approved
                        of Mr. Davis’ request for the assignment of Captain Colt.</p>
                    <p>6. Memorandum No. 129 was read regarding the memorandum which Dr. Mezes had
                        submitted with regard to the status of certain members of his staff. Dr.
                        Mezes’ request as stated in the memorandum in question was approved by the
                        Commission.</p>
                    <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>8. Memorandum No. 131 was read regarding the request from the Minister of
                        Foreign Affairs of the so-called Montenegrin government in Paris, to have
                        the representative of Montenegro admitted to the Peace Conference. The
                        Commissioners approved of the recommendation that the Secretary General be
                        authorized to reply that this request should be addressed to the Secretary
                        General of the Peace Conference.</p>
                    <p>9. Memorandum No. 132 was read regarding the numerous requests which have
                        been received from Bulgaria that permission be granted it to send persons to
                        Paris unofficially. The Commissioners recommended <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96"
                            facs="0132"/>that notes be drafted to both the British and the French
                        Delegation stating that the above requests had been received by the American
                        Mission, and asking for any suggestions which those Delegations might care
                        to make in the premises in order that our reply to the Bulgarian government
                        should be in harmony with the views of the British and French
                        governments.</p>
                    <p>10. Memorandum No. 133 was read regarding the recommendation by General
                        Churchill with respect to relief of Lt. Voska from his present duties. The
                        Commissioners having learned that General Bliss would probably not desire
                        the Mission to make a direct recommendation to the military authorities in
                        this matter, suggest that a memorandum stating the facts in the case as
                        strongly as possible should be sent to the military authorities. They felt
                        that if this statement of the facts was properly worded the competent
                        military authority would surely relieve Lt. Voska of his present duties.</p>
                    <p>11. Memorandum No. 134 was read embodying a statement presented by Mr.
                        Laroche to Dr. Day regarding the action of the French army in the Orient
                        with respect to the Rumanian and Serbian dispute in the Banat. The
                        Commissioners were satisfied with this statement as well as the statement
                        which Dr. Day had made in the premises, and therefore felt that there was no
                        further action for them to take at the present time.</p>
                    <p>12. Memorandum No. 135 was read regarding the memorandum prepared by Admiral
                        Benson with respect to the advisability of assisting the Food Administration
                        in supplying Germany and Czecho-Slovakia by way of the city of Hamburg and
                        the river Elbe. The Commissioners agreed that in view of Admiral Benson’s
                        recommendations it would be advisable to have the port of Hamburg used for
                        the purposes described and that the matter should be taken up with the
                        Armistice Commission in order that the German Government may be notified of
                        this intent.</p>
                    <p>13. Memorandum No. 136 was read with regard to the internal situation in
                        Germany. The Commissioners felt that the recommendations made in this
                        memorandum were very sound but that since this whole question would shortly
                        be discussed at the Quai d’Orsay it would not be advisable for the United
                        States to take any separate action in the premises at the present time.</p>
                    <p>14. Memorandum No. 137 was read regarding the printing in French of the
                        speeches and messages of President Wilson from the date of his landing in
                        Brest. The Commissioners agreed that it would be an excellent idea to have
                        this done but were unable to understand why the cost of printing 15,000
                        copies would be about 14,600 francs if the cost of striking off 200 copies
                        was only 800 francs. Mr. Lansing felt that the first of these estimates was
                        exorbitant and would be glad to know just why it should be so high. He felt
                        that if the cost of paper <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0133"/>was in any
                        way connected with this high estimate it might perhaps be advisable to get
                        the paper from the United States.</p>

                    <p>1. Mr. White stated that he had received a telegram signed by Mrs. E. H.
                        Harriman and Mr. Herbert Pratt, asking him to serve as chairman of an
                        American Committee which would insist on having certain official pictures of
                        the members of the American Delegation of the Peace Conference painted for
                        the United States. The telegram added that if Mr. White would accept this
                        position the Committee would be sure of complete financial backing and Mr.
                        White could immediately offer Sargent $50,000 for a picture of the
                        Conference. The Commissioners felt that it would be advisable for Mr. White
                        to accept this post and he therefore consented.</p>
                    <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>3. Mr. White asked whether at the Quai d’Orsay, any decision had been reached
                        yesterday with regard to allowing food stuffs to be sent into
                        German-Austria. Mr. Lansing said that no such decision had been reached and
                        that during the discussion Sonnino had been greatly incensed by the attitude
                        taken in the matter by the French and American representatives;
                        nevertheless, after considerable persuasion Mr. Sonnino agreed that this
                        matter should be placed on the agenda for Friday’s meeting and should, at
                        that time, be decided finally.</p>
                    <p>4. General Bliss stated that he had recently obtained from the British
                        certain information with regard to the naval expedition which they were
                        contemplating sending to Murmansk. This information he had obtained in
                        connection with the proposal that the United States should send several
                        gun-boats and smaller craft to the same destination. He read two letters
                        from General Ratcliffe explaining the British position in the matter, and
                        indicating that the British were intending to send about April 15th, a
                        complete expedition including proper mine sweepers, transport material etc.,
                        to assist in the withdrawal of the expedition. General Ratcliffe had felt,
                        however, that the allied forces at Murmansk would have to deal a final and
                        strong <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0134"/>blow against the Bolsheviki if
                        this withdrawal, a delicate operation at best, was to be performed without
                        severe incumbrances because of attacks by the Bolsheviks. He therefore
                        suggested that perhaps the United States would be willing to send 50 well
                        trained American officers to assist in the maneuver.</p>
                    <p>General Bliss pointed out that although these letters from General Ratcliffe
                        indicated that a withdrawal of the forces at Murmansk was being planned, no
                        such definite statement had yet been made by the British government. He felt
                        that some such statement should be made although he appreciated the fact
                        that it would encourage the Bolsheviks tremendously.</p>
                    <p>5. General Bliss stated that he would present to the Commissioners at about
                        11:30 this morning the final translation of the military and naval terms
                        which were to be imposed on Germany. Mr. Lansing stated that it was his
                        understanding that these terms were the final and conclusive peace terms and
                        that he had therefore been much surprised at Pichon’s statement to the
                        effect that they were merely a continuation of the armistice terms. General
                        Bliss concurred in Mr. Lansing’s views on the matter, and was very sure that
                        an examination of the minutes of the meeting of the Council of Ten,<note
                            n="63a" xml:id="d28fn63a">See BC-30 (SWC-7), minute 1, <ref

                                >iii</hi>, p. 1001</ref>.</note> at which this matter was discussed,
                        would indicate that these terms were to be final peace terms and not merely
                        armistice terms. He was further convinced that this was the President’s view
                        of the matter, and in case of any discussion we should adhere to it.</p>
                    <p>6. Memorandum No. 138 was read inquiring whether the Commissioners would be
                        willing to have applications made in their names for various members of Dr.
                        Mezes’ section to return to the United States on transports. The
                        Commissioners agreed that they were perfectly willing to have such
                        applications made in their names.</p>
                    <p>7. Mr. Herter reminded the Commissioners of a decision which they had [made]
                        a few days ago that it would be inadvisable to have members of the American
                        Press in Germany use the German radio at Nauen and Hanover for sending out
                        of press despatches. He explained that this decision of the Commissioners
                        had been conveyed to the Associated Press and that Mr. Elmer Roberts of that
                        association had replied indicating how, in his opinion, it would be very
                        valuable for the American correspondents in Germany to have this privilege.
                        Mr. Herter then asked whether the Commissioners would desire to have a
                        memorandum on this subject read incorporating Mr. Roberts’ arguments, but
                        the Commissioners felt that they would not care to change their decision in
                        the premises, and that it would therefore not be worth while even reading
                        over or discussing this matter.</p>
                    <p>8. Memorandum No. 140 was read inquiring whether the Commissioners <pb n="99"
                            xml:id="pg_99" facs="0135"/>desired that in accordance with Mr. Noulens’
                        request a civilian should accompany the three American army officers to
                        Warsaw, and inquiring whether, if so, Mr. Phelps should be assigned to the
                        position.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners were unable to see the necessity of a civilian accompanying
                        the army officers to Warsaw, and therefore felt that it would be undesirable
                        for any to be so assigned. They also thought that it would be best to have
                        instructions issued to Mr. Phelps to proceed at once to the Hague where he
                        had already been assigned to the Legation.</p>
                    <p>9. Memorandum No. 141 was read regarding the sending of a field mission to
                        Turkey. Mr. Dominian’s letter in the premises was read in full. The
                        Commissioners felt that the proposed mission was very numerous and that the
                        estimated expenses rather too great. They are not quite clear as to why such
                        a large mission should be sent, and what the particular interest of the
                        United States was in obtaining any more than political information for so
                        large a tract of Asia Minor, Syria, the Caucasus, etc. They therefore ask
                        that Dr. Bowman be requested to attend the meeting of the Commissioners
                        tomorrow, March 7th, 1919, in order to explain in detail the purpose of the
                        mission and the necessity for having so large a personnel.</p>

                    <p>1. The Commissioners began by discussing the meeting at the Quai d’Orsay
                        yesterday, at which the report of the Supreme War Council on the military
                        and naval terms which should be imposed on Germany was brought up.<note

                        Bliss said that he differed with Admiral Benson in the latter’s opinion that
                        the signing of a convention such as the one proposed would in no way be an
                        infringement of our national sovereignty. Mr. Lansing agreed with General
                        Bliss in this, but at the same time felt sure that the Senate would not
                        ratify any treaty which would involve the United States taking an active
                        part in the control over a period of years of German armaments. Mr. Lansing
                        at the same time felt that it was a mistake to mention the League of Nations
                        in this particular convention because the League <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100"
                            facs="0136"/>was not yet in existence, and there was always the
                        possibility that it might not come into existence. General Bliss added that
                        as far as he individually was concerned, he would never stand for the
                        insertion of a clause carrying with it perpetual control of German armament
                        by any inter-Allied body.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing called attention to the clause in the proposed convention which
                        permitted the Allies to forbid the importation into Germany of all such raw
                        materials as might be used for the manufacture of arms or armaments, and
                        stated that in his opinion, this clause would have to be struck out, as it
                        gave to the Allies perpetual economic control of Germany. General Bliss
                        stated that he had agreed to this clause in conference with Marshal Foch
                        only because if he had not done so, no report whatever would have been
                        handed down to the Council of Ten, Marshal Foch having stated that he would
                        not submit any report on which reservations were made by the American
                        delegate on the Supreme War Council. He agreed with Mr. Lansing, however,
                        that this clause should be struck out.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing stated that the kernel of the matter lay in France’s unfortunate
                        geographical position vis-a-vis Germany, and that this was a matter which we
                        could not help. He felt that we should now take a very firm stand with
                        regard to the dis-armament of Germany [and?] lay down our policy under three
                        heads: <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>Reduce Germany to impotence in a military sense.</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>Make her promise to reduce the manufacture of arms and munitions
                                to certain limits.</item>
                            <label>(3)</label>
                            <item>Make her guarantee the fulfilment of the above clause by providing
                                that France might occupy a portion of German territory in the case
                                of a violation of the agreement.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>General Bliss felt that the first two points were adequate, but that the
                        third would merely lead to trouble in a certain number of years, because if
                        Germany took it into her head to violate the agreement, her first step in
                        that direction would be to protect strongly that portion of Germany which it
                        had been agreed France might occupy. …</p>
                    <p>General Bliss observed that in his opinion, one further requirement should be
                        exacted of Germany; namely, that she should pass on a statutory basis an
                        enactment limiting of her own free will her army and navy. Such a provision
                        would be more effective than any terms which would have to be perpetually
                        guaranteed by the Allies, and if once passed, we could leave Germany alone
                        to work out her own salvation.</p>
                    <p>2. Mr. Hoover, Colonel Logan and Mr. Harrison entered the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hoover stated that the Italians were behaving extremely badly in regard
                        to the feeding of both the territories of the former <pb n="101"
                            xml:id="pg_101" facs="0137"/>Austrian-Hungarian Empire and the Jugo-Slav
                        territory. He added that although a few days ago a proposal had been made
                        that America be appointed as mandatory for all the railways of these
                        districts, a proposal which we naturally had to refuse, it was necessary for
                        us to have placed at our disposition a certain number of cars and
                        locomotives with which to move adequately the food which we were supplying
                        to these districts. The Italians were putting all sorts of obstructions in
                        our way, and had even gone so far as to say that they were unprepared to
                        answer Mr. Hoover’s proposal because it was an entirely new matter. In
                        refutation of this Mr. Hoover read the following memorandum: <table

                        indicating the nature of the difficulties to be met.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>“The difficulties of internal transportation in the area of the old
                            Austrian Empire do not altogether surround the difficulties of moving
                            foodstuffs out of Trieste. While a large part of these difficulties
                            manifest themselves at Trieste, this is by no means the only point of
                            obstruction.</p>
                        <p>Considerable friction is constantly taking place between the
                            Czecho-Slovaks and the Austrians, between the Austrians and the
                            Jugo-Slavs, between all three and the Italians, and between the
                            Jugo-Slavs and the Hungarians. These difficulties arise over jealousy in
                            the partition of the limited amount of capable rolling stock, the
                            exchanges <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0139"/>required at some
                            points of frontiers. Aside from the food blockade precipitated by the
                            Italian-Jugo-Slav controversy, some solution must be found which
                            superimposes the control over all of these different states.</p>
                        <p>For instance, the relation[s] of the Jugo-Slavs with the Hungarians are
                            such that there is little food movement out of the Banat and other areas
                            of surplus food supplies in certain localities, particularly the excess
                            of potatoes in Poland which could be transported into Czecho-Slovakia
                            and Austria. There is a surplus of sugar in Czecho-Slovakia which could
                            be distributed into the other states. There is a surplus of salt in
                            Austria which could be moved also. All of this movement is obstructed by
                            a total chaos in railway administration. Above, superimposed on all of
                            these, is a jealousy in coal distribution in the face of great shortages
                            and the almost insuperable difficulties of finding sufficient coal to
                            keep food movements in operation.</p>
                        <p>All of the interior states, that is, the Czechs, Austrians, Jugo-Slavs
                            and Hungarians, would be glad to contribute their proportions of the
                            necessary rolling stock to move food through the country if it could be
                            contributed to an independent direction who could assure its use for
                            these primary purposes.</p>
                        <p>I should like to again point out that it is necessary to move 3,000 tons
                            daily out of the port of Trieste if order and human life are to be
                            preserved, that with the very great good will that Signor Crespi and his
                            colleagues have been able to bring to bear, they have so far been able
                            to move a maximum of 800 tons a day inland over the Udine route. It is
                            hopeless to secure the necessary movement of food except by the use of
                            all railway routes out of Trieste and Fiume. Furthermore, as these
                            railways traverse Jugo-Slav territory, where there is acute starvation,
                            it is hopeless to expect any safety of operation through Jugo-Slav
                            territory unless Jugo-Slav populations are themselves supported.[”]</p>

                    <p>Mr. Hoover then spoke of a scheme which he had presented for consideration
                        which was perfectly satisfactory to all the nations of the former
                        Austro-Hungarian Empire, and by which the United States, through Mr. Hoover,
                        would control the necessary amount of rolling stock of all of these nations
                        to effect an equitable distribution of food. This scheme was acceptable only
                        because of the confidence of these nations in the United States, [and] he
                        states Italian interference in it would spoil the whole scheme.
                        Nevertheless, Mr. Hoover was doubtful of its success because both the French
                        and the Italians were strongly opposed, in fact, Mr. Hoover yesterday had
                        received a letter from Marshal Foch in which the latter had insisted on the
                        French authorities controlling all the railways in Czecho-Slovakia.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hoover felt that in spite of the opposition, his scheme could go through
                        because the British were practically pledged to it, and France’s opposition
                        appeared to be centered in Marshal Foch. He asked that the latter be
                        requested to explain his interest in the railroads of Czecho-Slovakia. All
                        the Commissioners felt that General Weygand was responsible for this
                        situation.</p>
                    <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0140"/>
                    <p>Mr. Hoover observed that he had not yet told the Italians that their food
                        supply would shortly be cut off. He realized that the situation in Italy was
                        very serious, in fact probably more acute than it had been at any time
                        during the war, but that neither he nor the American people would
                        countenance Italy’s receiving preferential treatment over Poland, Bohemia or
                        the Jugo-Slav territories, inasmuch as public sentiment was strongly in
                        favor of rendering all assistance to these latter territories in order to
                        help them during the difficult period of their creation. He added that the
                        Italians after having held up approximately 60,000 tons of food at Trieste
                        had now asked that this food be diverted for Italian use. The Commissioners
                        agreed that Italy’s whole attitude in this matter was probably affected by
                        her desire to have this food transferred for her own use. Mr. Hoover then
                        suggested that Mr. Lansing speak to Sonnino about this matter just before
                        the conference at the Quai d’Orsay this afternoon. Mr. Lansing should
                        definitely threaten Sonnino that unless Italy gave her support to the
                        American scheme and allowed ample cars and locomotives for the proper
                        distribution of this food, the United States would allow Italy to starve
                        together with the other countries. Mr. Lansing agreed to do this.</p>
                    <p>3. Mr. Lamont, Mr. Strauss, Mr. Baruch, Mr. McCormick, Mr. Davis, Mr.
                        Robinson, Mr. McFadden and Mr. Sheldon entered the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lamont read a short resume of what had taken place at the Armistice
                        Commission at Spa, when the associated governments had tried to reach an
                        agreement with Germany in regard to the feeding of Germany, and the latter’s
                        delivery of her merchant marine to the associated governments. He stated
                        that the Germans had refused to deliver their merchant fleet until the
                        associated governments had given them a definite guarantee that sufficient
                        food would be supplied to Germany to tide her over until the next harvest.
                        The German delegates asked whether the delegates of the associated
                        governments would consider pro rata deliveries of the German marine in
                        accordance with the amount of food sent to Germany. This proposal the
                        representatives of the associated governments stated that they were not
                        authorized to consider. The German delegates then appealed to their
                        government which flatly refused to consider any further proposal, such a one
                        as the representatives of the associated governments had been authorized to
                        make. Mr. Hoover, Mr. Davis and Mr. Strauss were all of the opinion that
                        this was a political matter and the present German government could not
                        afford to cede its merchant fleet under the circumstances. Mr. McCormick
                        added that the associated governments had only agreed to allow Germany
                        270,000 tons of food stuffs in return for the use of the whole German
                        merchant fleet, which was, after all, Germany’s only bargaining material.
                        The French government <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0141"/>was insisting
                        that Germany be fed by American credits only and the German government
                        apparently was cognizant of all the difficulties which the French and
                        American governments were having in reaching a final agreement.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hoover stated that it would take between four and five hundred million
                        dollars to feed Germany until the next harvest. Germany’s assets were not
                        sufficient to care for this sum, besides, there was a serious unemployment
                        problem which had to be met if order was to be kept in Germany.</p>
                    <p>Just as an indication of the chaotic condition of Germany, Mr. Strauss told
                        the story of the complete insubordination of the German clerks who were
                        working for Mr. Melchior, German financial delegate. Mr. McCormick said that
                        M. Clemenceau was trying to put the whole blame of allowing Germany to
                        starve on the United States because the United States would not supply the
                        necessary credit.</p>
                    <p>All present agreed to Mr. Hoover’s statement that the United States could not
                        supply the necessary credits because Congress was not in session, etc., and
                        would not even if she could. Mr. Davis felt that we should make to Germany a
                        firm fair proposal in regard to feeding her until the next harvest, and then
                        take her ships whether she liked it or not.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hoover then read the following memorandum which had been prepared by Mr.
                        McFadden: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        no solution in the matter of payment. Mr. McFadden admitted that there was

                    <p>Mr. Davis called attention to a certain article in the above memorandum and

                        with 270,000 tons of food, the whole matter had fallen through because the

                    <p>Mr. Hoover then suggested a new solution of the problem. He proposed that a

                        Germany for limited trade. On the outward trip the German Government should
                        be allowed to select its own cargo subject to certain restrictions, and this
                        cargo could be sent to certain specified ports. On the return trip these
                        ships could then carry food for Germany. The rest of the merchant marine
                        should be turned over to the Allies to be used in the feeding of Germany and
                        other European <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0145"/>nations. Mr. Hoover
                        explained that this solution would take care of a portion of the
                        unemployment problem in Germany because German crews could be used on these
                        ships, and would, at the same time allow Germany to export sufficient
                        materials to pay for a large amount of food stuffs which she required.</p>
                    <p>Several objections were raised to Mr. Hoover’s scheme, chief among which were
                        the inevitable British and French refusal to allow any ship carrying the
                        German flag to enter into the trade of the world while we were all still,
                        technically, at war. Mr. Hoover explained that his suggestion had the added
                        advantage of not definitely guaranteeing food to Germany until the next
                        harvest. He felt that such a guarantee might induce Germany not to sign
                        peace. Mr. McCormick explained that the whole trouble in this matter was not
                        between us and the Germans, but between us and the French. Mr. Lansing
                        agreed with him that we should present our views in the matter very strongly
                        to the French Government. Mr. Davis observed, however, that the French would
                        use a very subtle argument, which was hard to answer, namely, that the
                        United States was, according to our scheme, trying to get rid of its surplus
                        food stuffs and at the same time take over German material assets which
                        should by rights be paid to France in the form of indemnities. Mr. McCormick
                        believed that this argument could be offset if we arranged so that
                        two-thirds of the food stuffs to be supplied Germany should come from
                        outside of the United States and one-third from within the United States.
                        Mr. Hoover had figured that it would be possible to obtain that much from
                        the markets of other countries. Mr. Hoover then again made a plea for his
                        suggestion, stating that it was based purely on common sense and reason, and
                        that if adopted it would put the United States on the offensive and not
                        perpetually on the defensive. If we were refused by the other associated
                        governments, they would then have to offer some better substitute.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Davis remarked that the Supreme Economic Council was meeting at 12
                        o’clock and that at that time an effort would be made to get the French to
                        lift the blockade on certain specified goods. He added that he understood
                        that the meeting had agreed on the following points.</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>(1)</label>
                        <item>That freight charges of the German mercantile marine should go toward
                            the payment of food stuffs.</item>

                        <item>That Germany should be allowed to ship coal and certain other
                            materials to France in part payment for food stuffs.</item>
                        <label>(3)</label>
                        <item>That Germany should be permitted to pay for the importation of food
                            stuffs from neutral countries.</item>
                        <label>(4)</label>
                        <item>That under certain conditions Germany might be allowed to dispose of
                            some of her foreign securities in order to assist her in paying for some
                            of her food stuffs.</item>
                    </list>
                    <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0146"/>
                    <p>In return for this the associated governments would supply food to Germany
                        until the next harvest, provided the merchant fleet were turned over to the
                        associated governments. Mr. Sheldon remarked that as he understood it
                        credits for all exports from Germany should go toward the payment for food
                        stuffs. Mr. Hoover added that he hoped another point would be decided upon,
                        namely, that on the outward voyage Germany should be allowed to export with
                        a certain freedom.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lamont then asked that Mr. Lansing bring up the whole question at the
                        next meeting of the Supreme War Council, and propose that the whole matter
                        of feeding Germany be referred by that Council to the Supreme Economic
                        Council for final disposition.</p>
                    <p>This Mr. Lansing agreed to do.</p>

                    <p>1. Mr. Lansing read a letter which General Bliss had sent to all the
                        Commissioners, the text of which is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“I suggest that the American representative or representatives on
                                each of the Committees appointed by the Peace Conference or by the
                                Council of Ten be instructed to report to the American Delegation,
                                before the arrival of the President, in what respect (if any) the
                                report of his Committee violates (if it does violate) any of the
                                President’s declarations, and what is the justification for it.”</p>
                            <p rend="right">(Signed) Tasker H. Bliss</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The Commissioners approved highly of the recommendation made by General
                        Bliss, and requested that Mr. Grew have a circular in this sense sent to all
                        the secretaries of the various Commissions, instructing them to have reports
                        submitted by noon on Thursday March 13th.</p>
                    <p>2. Mr. White stated that at a late hour last night he had been informed by
                        the Secretary General of the Waterways Commission that M. Clemenceau had
                        requested a decision by that Commission on the question of the Kiel canal by
                        3 o’clock today. He informed the Commissioners that he would shortly be
                        going to a meeting of this Commission and asked if they had any views in
                        regard to the canal. The Commissioners agreed that for the present at least
                        we should maintain <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0147"/>that the Kiel
                        canal is purely a German canal and that we have no interest in it further
                        than the destruction of such fortifications as may now protect it. It was
                        brought out that the British delegates would probably recommend the
                        destruction in the canal of certain great locks which permitted the passage
                        of large war vessels. The Commissioners felt strongly that it would be of no
                        material advantage to any of the associated governments to have these locks
                        destroyed, and that in future they may be very useful if it were later
                        contemplated to send large merchant vessels to the Baltic. Mr. White stated
                        that he would take a firm stand in this matter.</p>
                    <p>3. Mr. White observed that at the meeting of the Waterways Commission
                        yesterday the French and Belgian delegates had particularly requested that
                        the United States have a representative on the proposed International Rhine
                        Commission. Mr. White had reserved a decision on this point and asked the
                        Commissioners how they felt about it. The Commissioners felt that it would
                        be distinctly inadvisable for the United States to be represented on a
                        purely European mission of this sort, and requested that Mr. White withhold
                        his decision in the premises.</p>
                    <p>4. General Bliss brought up for discussion the question of the many leaks
                        which had occurred, presumably for some purpose, with regard to the
                        discussions at the Quai d’Orsay. He mentioned in particular the article
                        which appeared this morning in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Mail</hi>
                        regarding the reduction of the German army to 100,000 men. The Commissioners
                        felt that the giving out of such information as this was distinctly a breach
                        of the agreement entered into by the various countries with regard to the
                        publication of news, and decided it was a matter to be discussed at the
                        Council of Ten. General Bliss felt that at the same time our attitude in the
                        matter should be explained and therefore offered to interview the American
                        press on the subject this morning.</p>
                    <p>5. Mr. Herter stated that both Reginald Foster and Captain Bruce were in town
                        and that the former had extremely interesting information about Poland to
                        divulge, whereas the latter had just come from Montenegro where he had been
                        able to make an excellent survey of the situation. The Commissioners felt
                        that as there was much business to be done they would be unable to see these
                        gentlemen today.</p>
                    <p>6. Mr. Herter then told the Commissioners that two days ago a meeting had
                        been held in the Crillon for those members of the Commission who are
                        interested either directly or indirectly in the Russian situation. These
                        individuals had decided to meet at regular intervals in order to correlate
                        all the information at their disposal with regard to Russia, be in a
                        position to furnish this information to the Commissioners at any time,
                        ascertain the attitude of the various other missions in Paris in the
                        premises, and to systematically interview all Russians who might come to
                        Paris. Mr. Herter explained that these gentlemen were not <pb n="112"
                            xml:id="pg_112" facs="0148"/>trying to formulate any policy with regard
                        to Russia, but were merely trying to obtain such data as would eventually
                        enable the Commissioners to form such a policy. The Commissioners highly
                        approved of this procedure and hoped that the individuals in question would
                        continue their meetings.</p>
                    <p>7. Memorandum No. 50 [<hi rend="italic">150?</hi>] was read regarding certain
                        advances which had been made by Halil Pacha formerly Governor General of
                        Vilayet of Beirut now President of the Albanian Delegation, to the British
                        Peace Delegation regarding the future of Turkey. The Commissioners felt that
                        there was no necessity of their taking any decision with regard to what
                        attitude they might adopt should Halil Pacha address a similar communication
                        to them. It will be time enough for them to determine their attitude when
                        the matter actually comes up.</p>
                    <p>8. Memorandum No. 151 was read regarding the sending of General Haller’s<note
                            n="72" xml:id="d30fn72">General Josef Haller, of the Polish forces in
                            France.</note> division to Poland. The Commissioners noted Dr. Bowman’s
                        recommendation that three American Colonels with their staffs be sent
                        immediately to Warsaw without waiting for the other Powers to get their
                        contingents together, and that the American Plenipotentiary formally raise
                        the question at the Council of Ten as to the progress made in obtaining
                        shipping, etc., for the sending of General Haller’s division to Danzig.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners were of the opinion that a decision had already been
                        reached regarding the first of these recommendations, namely, that the three
                        Colonels in question should be despatched to Warsaw immediately. At the same
                        time they felt, however, that these Colonels or at least one or two of them,
                        should have a fluent knowledge of French in order that they would not be
                        under the handicap that General Kernan appears to be under in Poland. With
                        regard to the second recommendation, the American Commissioners felt that
                        there would be no purpose served in bringing up this question again in the
                        Council of Ten merely for the sake of having it put on record. If a proper
                        opportunity arose, however, they would be glad to press the matter as much
                        as possible.</p>
                    <p>9. Memorandum No. 152 was read suggesting that a telegram be sent to the
                        American Delegation [<hi rend="italic">Legation</hi>] at Copenhagen
                        informing it that a mission is now on its way to Esthonia and Latvia. The
                        Commissioners approved of the telegram in question as well as the
                        supplementary telegram to the Department of State, with the exception of the
                        last sentence in each case.<note n="73" xml:id="d30fn73">Telegram No. 1136,

                        Legation at Copenhagen that the mission was giving serious consideration to
                        the question of the recognition of Finland.</p>
                    <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0149"/>
                    <p>10. Memorandum No. 153 was read suggesting that a telegram be sent to Mr.
                        Polk with regard to economic assistance to certain of the Baltic States. The
                        telegram in question was approved by the Commissioners.<note n="74"
                            xml:id="d30fn74">See telegram No. 1131, March 12, 1919, 4 p.m., <ref

                    <p>11. Mr. Herter read a letter written by Mr. Grew addressed to the Secretary
                        General of the Peace Commission, with regard to the official languages to be
                        used in drawing up the Peace Treaty with Germany. The Commissioners approved
                        of Mr. Grew’s letter in the premises.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners felt that the time had now come to consider seriously the
                        form in which the Peace Treaty should be drawn up. They thought that if the
                        military, naval and aerial terms as well as the League of Nations Covenant
                        were included in the body of the Treaty it would become ridiculously long
                        and unwieldy. They therefore felt that it should be as brief a statement as
                        possible, but should be accompanied by annexes in which special details and
                        specifications were set forth. In this connection, they request that Mr.
                        Grew get into touch with Major James Brown Scott immediately with a view to
                        drafting a suggested article to be inserted in the treaty whereby the
                        Covenant of the League of Nations could be incorporated within the Treaty,
                        but at the same time be an annex thereto. They suggested that in drafting
                        this article, Germany be required to recognize the existence and
                        jurisdiction of the League of Nations, a body constituted in accordance with
                        an annexed Covenant, which Covenant forms an integral and inseparable part
                        of the Peace Treaty.</p>
                    <p>The advantages of having the Covenant so inserted in the Peace Treaty are
                        two-fold. It first necessitates its being ratified together with the whole
                        treaty and secondly, it allows to the neutrals an opportunity of signing the
                        Covenant without signing the Peace Treaty.</p>
                    <p>12. Memorandum No. 155 was read regarding the disposition which should be
                        made of many letters and telegrams which are received by the Department of
                        State in Washington on the League of Nations. The Commissioners did not
                        approve of the suggested reply to the Department of State in this matter,
                        but felt that inasmuch as all this correspondence was already acknowledged
                        by the State Department, it would be well to have it sent on to the
                        Commission for whatever disposition the latter might see fit. The Mission
                        would in this way be in no wise obligated in taking any action on this
                        correspondence, but at the same time the State Department would be in a
                        position to say that it had referred it to the Peace Mission.</p>
                    <p>Information Memorandum No. 31 was read regarding a telegram sent by Mr. Oscar
                        T. Crosby to Mr. Norman H. Davis respecting a report the former was
                        preparing on the Austrian financial situation.</p>

                    <p>13. Information Memorandum No. 32 was read regarding certain despatches which
                        had been received from Rear-Admiral Bristol, Senior U. S. Naval Officer in
                        Turkish Waters, regarding both the Russian volunteer army in the Ukraine and
                        the opposition of the non-Moslem population in Turkey in the military
                        service.</p>

                            of Mr. Norman H. Davis, of Captain E. L. Sanborn to assist with work in
                            connection with the Armistice Commission. The Commissioners approved of

                            Esthonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The Commissioners approved of the
                            assignment of Lt. Colonel Warwick Greene as the chief of this Mission,
                            and likewise approved of the rest of the personnel suggested to

                        <item>Information Memorandum No. 33 was read regarding the confidential
                            interview which Mr. Franklin Day had recently had with Prof. L. Beer, a
                            professor of International law at Leipzig. The Commissioners were very
                            skeptical in regard to Prof. Beer’s statements as to his conviction of
                            the Emperor’s personal responsibility on the origin of the war, and
                            believed that this expression of opinion was one which could commonly be
                            found among those who now in Germany were trying to save their own
                            skins.</item>

                        <item>Mr. Herter brought up the question of Prof. Lord’s recall from Poland,
                            and explained that General Kernan had not been recalled owing to the
                            importance of his presence in Poland at the present time. The
                            Commissioners approved of the telegram drafted by Mr. Grew recalling
                            Prof. Lord.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Herter distributed to the Commissioners copies of a memorandum
                            prepared by Captain James Bruce regarding the situation in Montenegro.
                            The Commissioners were much interested in this memorandum, but felt that
                            they could not agree to the recommendations <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115"
                                facs="0151"/>proposed. Recommendation No. 2 particularly was
                            disapproved. At the moment, all the Commissioners stated they would
                            examine the question further before reaching any final decision.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>The controversy which had arisen at the Council of Ten in regard to
                            the Jugo-Slav-Italian dispute was discussed. Mr. Lansing felt that the
                            American Delegate should adopt the attitude that if this question was
                            further discussed at the Council of Ten either both Italy and Serbia
                            should be represented or else neither one nor the other. He also felt
                            that immediately upon the arrival of the President the American
                            Delegation should adopt a definite policy in regard to territorial
                            claims such as those in dispute, and that this policy should be
                            approximately the following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The disposition of territory should be considered from the point
                                    of view of the ethnic condition of the Hinterland and not of the
                                    littoral or of individual ports on the coast.”</p>

                        <item>Mr. Herter referred to a second informal gathering which had taken
                            place yesterday afternoon to discuss Russian matters in the Hotel
                            Crillon, and mentioned certain reports which had been read at that
                            meeting by Lieut. Williams and Lieut. Bell. The Commissioners expressed
                            enthusiastic approval of the proceedings of this informal gathering and
                            requested that they be supplied at once with copies of the reports which
                            had been read as well as of the map which had been prepared by Lt.
                            Bell.</item>

                    <p>1. Mr. Buckler stated that in a conversation which he had had with Mr.
                        Gompers, the day before, he had been alarmed to find that Mr. Gompers had a
                        very definite charge to make against Mr. Bullitt. Mr. Gompers had first
                        merely referred to Mr. Bullitt’s general activities in Switzerland, but was
                        finally pinned down to a statement of the exact information which he
                        possessed against him. He produced a copy of a letter which he proposed
                        sending to the Commissioners <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0152"
                        />quoting a statement purported to have been made by Mr. Bullitt to Mr.
                        Frank Bohn in Switzerland. This statement was in substance that he, Mr.
                        Bullitt, had been sent to Switzerland by the American Commission to
                        Negotiate Peace in order to give his approval to the activities of the
                        International Socialist Conference.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing was of the opinion that there was nothing in this charge against
                        Mr. Bullitt, but felt that inasmuch as it was an extremely important matter,
                        Mr. Gompers should be urged to put the thing in writing for presentation to
                        the Commissioners, and that the charge should then be sifted. Mr. Buckler
                        agreed to inform Mr. Gompers that the Commissioners would like to have this
                        whole question in writing.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Buckler withdrew.</p>
                    <p>2. Dr. Bowman, Major Tyler and Mr. Dominian entered the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Bowman stated that he understood that he and his colleagues had been
                        called into the meeting of the Commissioners to explain the necessity of so
                        large a Mission to the Near East as had been proposed by Mr. Dominian in
                        Memorandum No. 141 of March 5th.<note n="75" xml:id="d32fn75">See meeting of
                            March 6, minute 9, <ref target="#pg_99">p. 99</ref>.</note> Dr. Bowman
                        explained that there were many questions in the Near East which would
                        require determination by the Peace Conference, and that it was essential for
                        us to have first hand information in the premises. Among these questions he
                        mentioned the Armenian claims, the boundaries between Armenia and Georgia,
                        ethnic questions etc. Mr. Lansing observed that he was not in favor of
                        studying the boundary questions of these districts any further at the
                        present time, and that he was not particularly interested in the districts
                        mentioned. He felt that the three great questions in the Near East which
                        required decisions were: (1) Mandatories, (2) Syria and (3) Greek claims in
                        Asia-Minor. He felt that on these questions we should receive as much
                        information as possible, but he understood that both Dr. Barton and Mr.
                        Glazebrook were or would be reporting to the Commission on these
                        matters.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing observed that in principle he was opposed to the sending of large
                        Missions to these districts because he foresaw no benefits coming from them
                        but that they would inevitably cause dissatisfaction among the people when
                        it was learned that the members of the Commission were not in a position to
                        take any authoritative action, or even to guarantee that the recommendations
                        which they made to their Government would be followed. Dr. Bowman inquired
                        whether this argument did not apply equally to the Missions which had
                        already gone to Germany and Austro-Hungary and Mr. Lansing admitted these
                        objections did exist, but not to such an extent.</p>
                    <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0153"/>
                    <p>After some further discussion, it was decided that the proposed Mission
                        should be cut down to about four or five field observers who should, if
                        possible, go under the guise of food investigators.</p>
                    <p>Major Tyler offered to submit a new project in the premises.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Bowman, Major Tyler and Mr. Dominian withdrew.</p>
                    <p>3. Lieut. Foster entered the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Lieut. Foster distributed to the Commissioners copies of a memorandum which
                        he had prepared regarding the situation in Poland, together with certain
                        definite recommendations for action which he hoped would be followed. He was
                        asked by the Commissioners to expand on this memorandum and give the reasons
                        for each one of his recommendations.</p>
                    <p>Lieut. Foster recommended that quick action be taken by the Associated
                        Governments instructing certain officers of these Governments now in Hungary
                        to occupy the railroad line running from East Galicia to Hungary in order to
                        stop the supplies of ammunition etc., which were going into the Ukraine. He
                        felt strongly that this action should be taken in order to impress the
                        peoples of the Ukraine with the seriousness of purpose and strength of the
                        Associated Governments. At the present time these peoples have no faith in
                        the Associated Governments, and were proceeding in a manner which completely
                        ignored the strength of these nations. In order to indicate the attitude of
                        the Ukraine, he read a newspaper article decrying the effectiveness of
                        control by the Allied and Associated Governments in the territories which
                        they had conquered.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners requested Lieut. Foster to take this matter up at once with
                        Norman Davis, who it was understood, had been entrusted with the control of
                        the Hungarian railways.</p>
                    <p>Lieut. Foster then asked that General Haller’s army be sent to Poland as soon
                        as possible. General Bliss agreed that this should be done and observed that
                        the Associated Governments had already concluded the advisability of such a
                        step. The lack of shipping was one obstacle in the way, and only the Allied
                        Maritime Council in London could supply the shipping. General Bliss
                        suggested that possibly it would be well to get the Council of Ten to prod
                        the Allied Maritime Council in this matter.</p>
                    <p>Lieut. Foster then discussed the necessity of sending raw materials as well
                        as clothing and shoes and ammunition into Poland. The Commissioners
                        requested Lieut. Foster to see Mr. McCormick about the shipment of raw
                        materials. They discussed the legal aspects of the A. E. F. selling its
                        surplus stocks of clothes and shoes to the Poles. They felt that perhaps an
                        act of Congress was necessary in order to enable the military authorities to
                        do this and therefore requested General Bliss to consult with the competent
                        military authorities as to what measures should be taken.</p>
                    <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0154"/>
                    <p>Lieut. Foster then discussed the reports which he had received with regard to
                        the complicity of the Germans and Bolsheviks in those parts of Lithuania
                        which were being evacuated by the German army. He had endeavored to verify
                        these reports by visiting the districts in question but had been refused
                        permission to enter the districts occupied by the German army of the <hi
                            rend="italic">Ober-Ost</hi>. Other members of the Inter-Allied Mission
                        to Poland had likewise been refused this permission. The Commissioners felt
                        that this was a very serious matter, and requested that a memorandum be
                        prepared at once to be put on the agenda for the next meeting of the Council
                        of Ten.</p>
                    <p>Lieut. Foster finally brought up the suggestion that the unemployed Poles who
                        at present numbered about 600,000 in Germany be allowed to come to France to
                        assist in reconstruction work. The Commissioners requested Lieut. Foster to
                        discuss this matter with Mr. McCormick.</p>
                    <p>3 [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. Mr. Herter brought up the question of the
                        Department’s sending a strong Commission to Constantinople as suggested by
                        Mr. Polk. The Commissioners approved highly of sending such a Commission,
                        but felt that in view of the delicate Palestine and Zionist question, it
                        would be inadvisable to send Mr. Elkus<note n="76" xml:id="d32fn76">Abram I.
                            Elkus, former Ambassador to Turkey.</note> at the head of this
                        Mission.</p>
                    <p>4. Memorandum No. 158 was read regarding a request made by Mr. Baruch for the
                        assignment of Major Hugh L. Gaddis for work with Mr. Baruch’s office. The
                        Commissioners approved of this assignment, and further approved of Mr.
                        Baruch’s having such officers assigned to his Bureau as he saw fit because
                        of the fact that he would pay all their expenses.</p>
                    <p>5. Memorandum No. 159 was read regarding a telegram received by the Embassy
                        in Paris from the Department of State inquiring as to whether newspaper
                        correspondents had gone to Germany on some arrangement made by the Peace
                        Commission, and as to whether in the opinion of the Embassy any attempt
                        should be made to exercise supervision of their activities. The
                        Commissioners were convinced that no newspaper men had gone into Germany
                        under some arrangement with the Peace Mission, but desire that before taking
                        any final decision in the premises Mr. Sweetser be asked to report on the
                        whole question, submitting for the Commission’s information a list of those
                        American newspaper men now in enemy States.</p>
                    <p>6. Memorandum No. 160 was read regarding the reply of the Chargé d’Affaires
                        in London with respect to the reported negotiations of Major Shackleton of
                        Great Britain with the North Russian Provincial Government for concessions
                        in and about Murman. The Commissioners noted the information contained in
                        the telegram with interest.</p>
                    <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0155"/>
                    <p>7. Memorandum No. 161 was read quoting a telegram which had been sent by Mr.
                        Oscar S. Strauss to Mr. Auchincloss regarding certain congresses which had
                        been held in the United States in favor of the League of Nations. The
                        Commissioners understood that this telegram had already been given great
                        publicity, in Great Britain at least, but approved of the recommendation
                        that it be given to the press in case the press had not yet received it.</p>
                    <p>8. Information Memorandum No. 34 was read regarding a recommendation made by
                        Mr. Polk that Mr. Lehrs, Vice-Consul in Copenhagen be authorized to visit
                        Baltic provinces. The Commissioners approved of the suggestion that Mr.
                        Lehrs be asked to wait in Copenhagen until the arrival of Lieut. Colonel
                        Greene and his party.</p>
                    <p>9. Information Memorandum No. 35 was read in which Mr. McNeir requested the
                        assignment of Captain Eugene E. Berl to his office. The Commissioners
                        approved of Captain Berl’s assignment to the Commission for this
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p>10. Memorandum regarding inquiries made of the Secretaries of the Committees
                        or Commissions appointed by the Peace Conference or by the Council of Ten as
                        to whether the reports submitted by them violated any of the President’s
                        declarations was read and the Commissioners requested that Mr. Grew furnish
                        copies to each of them for further study.</p>

                    <p>1. Memorandum No. 163 was read regarding an excursion which would shortly be
                        arranged to the devastated regions by the Secretary General of the Peace
                        Conference, and for which five places are being reserved for the American
                        Commission. The Commissioners requested that this invitation be acknowledged
                        with the expression of our appreciation, and with the statement that the
                        Commissioners will be glad to have five places reserved. The Commissioners
                        further desired that if possible, it be ascertained informally just what
                        portions of the devastated regions this excursion would cover. They likewise
                        stated that if they themselves were unable to go a suitable delegation from
                        the American Commission could be sent.</p>
                    <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0156"/>
                    <p>2. Memorandum No. 164 was read in which it was stated that Mr. Norman H.
                        Davis requested to have his resignation from the Financial Commission
                        accepted, and to have Mr. Thomas W. Lamont appointed in his place. The
                        Commissioners agreed that they would accept Mr. Davis’ resignation though
                        regretting extremely that he is unable to find the time to do the necessary
                        work, and at the same time agreed that Mr. Lamont should be designated to
                        take Mr. Davis’ place.</p>
                    <p>3. Memorandum No. 165 was read with regard to the proposed Mission to Turkey.
                        The Commissioners felt that again the personnel of the proposed Mission was
                        too numerous, and requested that the matter be reviewed once more. They were
                        unable to see that … or … had any of the necessary qualifications to go as
                        field observers, but said that they would be glad to reconsider their cases
                        if further material was furnished in the premises.</p>
                    <p>4. Memorandum No. 166 was read suggesting that Captain Hayford Peirce be
                        assigned to Prof. Coolidge’s Mission and directed to proceed to Warsaw as
                        soon as possible. The Commissioners asked whether in case this were done
                        Captain Peirce would have any connection with General Kernan’s Mission. They
                        felt strongly that both because of the fact that no reasons were given why
                        Captain Peirce should go to Warsaw, and because it would be extremely
                        inadvisable to send to Poland an independent officer who would not come
                        under General Kernan’s jurisdiction, that it would not be advisable to have
                        Captain Peirce assigned for the purpose indicated. They stated, however,
                        that they were willing to reconsider this matter provided General Kernan
                        approved, and Captain Peirce made a member of General Kernan’s Mission.</p>
                    <p>5. Memorandum No. 167 was read regarding the assignment of 2nd Lieut. W. H.
                        Osborn to Prof. Coolidge’s Mission in Vienna as Secretary to Prof. Philip
                        Brown. The Commissioners agreed that inasmuch as Lieut. Osborn was willing
                        to pay his own expenses while on this mission, and in view of his
                        qualifications, they approved his assignment for the purpose indicated.</p>
                    <p>6. The attention of the Commissioners was called to the fact that there were
                        several American painters now in Paris who were extremely anxious to know
                        whether the Government intended to have any official paintings made of the
                        Peace Conference itself or of Delegates to the Peace Conference. Some
                        confusion existed as to whether the National Fine Arts Committee in the
                        United States, of which Mr. White was the Honorary Chairman and which had
                        made to Sargent an offer to paint the Conference was a Government Committee
                        or not. The Commissioners felt that the Government should take no action
                        whatever in this matter and that since the National Fine Arts Committee
                        appeared to be a private organization, subsidized by some <pb n="121"
                            xml:id="pg_121" facs="0157"/>individuals, it was entirely up to that
                        Committee to decide what painters should undertake the work in question in
                        Paris.</p>
                    <p>7. The Commissioners discussed the position which the President had taken
                        yesterday at the Quai d’Orsay with regard to the insertion of the Covenant
                        of the League of Nations in the preliminary Peace Treaty. They felt that it
                        would be very difficult to incorporate the League of Nations Covenant in any
                        final form in this preliminary Peace Treaty, and that it would be better
                        merely to have Germany accept the League in principle. In this way the
                        Covenant in its final form could be incorporated in the final Peace Treaty.
                        The Commissioners further observed that the preliminary Peace Treaty was in
                        reality a complete and final declaration of peace which would have to be
                        ratified by all the contracting States. The so-called final Peace Treaty
                        would merely be a revision of this first Peace Treaty.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners requested Mr. Herter to have prepared for them two
                        memoranda: (1) embodying such information as was at the disposal of the
                        Commission with regard to public opinion in the United States, Great Britain
                        and France with respect to the necessity of further discussion and possible
                        amendment of the Covenant of the League of Nations, and the second, dealing
                        with the procedure which the various nations signatories to the Peace Treaty
                        would have to follow in order to have that Treaty ratified by their
                        respective Governments.</p>

                    <p>1. Mr. White observed that he had seen in the paper that the question of the
                        Kiel Canal was discussed yesterday at the Quai d’Orsay. He asked Mr. Lansing
                        if any decision had been arrived at or whether the recommendation of the
                        Commission on Waterways, Ports and Railways in regard to the Canal had been
                        considered. Mr. Lansing said that there had been some discussion about this
                        matter, and that a proposal had been made that the Kiel Canal should be put
                        under a regime similar to that of the Suez Canal. This suggestion had not
                        been definitely accepted however. Mr. Lansing also observed that he was
                        being very careful not to have the Kiel Canal given any status <pb n="122"
                            xml:id="pg_122" facs="0158"/>similar to the Panama Canal, which might
                        perhaps involve a whole discussion of the Panama Canal question by the
                        Conference.</p>
                    <p>2. General Bliss stated that Mr. Grew had referred to him certain papers in
                        regard to the difficulties between German-Austria and the Jugo-Slavs in
                        Carinthia. In these papers it appeared that the French Government was
                        suggesting that an Inter-Allied Commission headed by a French officer should
                        be sent to this district with a view to proposing a solution to the
                        difficulty. Mr. Dodge the American Minister at Belgrade had been asked to
                        appoint an American officer on this Commission.</p>
                    <p>General Bliss then stated that he had prepared a memorandum on this subject
                        strongly advocating that no American officer be assigned to this
                        Inter-Allied Mission. The text of General Bliss’ memorandum was read and the
                        following are the reasons given for which the detail of an American officer
                        on this Commission was disapproved.</p>

                            any duty with the Army of the East, and it is not believed to be wise
                            that, at this late date, we should have any connection with it
                            whatever.</item>

                        <item>The detail of an American officer on this Mission will give indirect

                            Hungarian-Roumanian front, and the Serbian-Roumanian front. I believe
                            that we should keep out of all of these.</item>

                            from these conflicts, at the present stage of the game, as
                            possible.</item>

                        <item>Finally, I desire to express my conviction that the United States
                            Government has every interest in avoiding entangling itself in the

                            in as a final arbiter in which case it can give its decision in
                            accordance with the Fourteen Declarations without having its hands tied
                            by unnecessary participation in the previous fruitless attempts at
                            solution.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The Commissioners agreed with General Bliss’ conclusions in this matter and
                        it was further decided that no American officer should be assigned to the
                        proposed Inter-Allied Commission.</p>
                    <p>3. Mr. Lansing asked what was the present status of General Churchill’s
                        staff. …</p>
                    <p>4. General Bliss read a letter which he had received from the Mercantile
                        Trust Company in regard to certain claims which that Company had against the
                        German Government. The Commissioners <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0159"
                        />agreed that it would be proper for General Bliss to acknowledge this
                        letter with the statement that it had been placed in the hands of the
                        competent authority and that the claims referred to therein would
                        undoubtedly be justly taken care of.</p>
                    <p>[5.] Memorandum No. 168 was read in which General Churchill submitted a
                        proposal that Captain William Yale accept an invitation tendered to him by
                        Colonel Lawrence to accompany the British Forces on an expedition which they
                        are planning for the month of May against the tribes of the Nejd. The
                        Commissioners did not approve of this proposal and suggested that in any
                        reply that should be made to Colonel Lawrence, it be stated that the
                        American Commission to Negotiate Peace cannot take cognizance of any
                        expedition which the British Forces are proposing to make against certain
                        Arabian tribes.</p>
                    <p>6. Memorandum No. 169 was read quoting a telegram from Brigadier General
                        Treat at Trieste to the effect that the British, French and American
                        representatives on the Laibach Investigation Committee had been at Laibach
                        since March 14th and that the Italian representative had not yet reported.
                        Mr. Lansing requested that a memorandum of this fact be prepared for him
                        immediately for submission to the Council of Ten by him at its next
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>7. Memorandum No. 170 was read prepared by Drs. Lord and Bowman, in regard to
                        the Teschen situation. The Commissioners approved of the recommendations
                        contained in the memorandum in question, and therefore request, (1) that Mr.
                        DuBois be appointed the American representative on the Inter-Allied Teschen
                        Commission and (2) that a memorandum be prepared for discussion at the next
                        meeting of the Council of Ten in regard to some statement which the great
                        Powers should make with respect to the decisions of the Teschen
                        Commission.</p>
                    <p>8. Mr. Miller entered the meeting. The Commissioners stated that they
                        understood that Mr. Miller had been present the previous night at the
                        Conference between the President, Colonel House and Lord Robert Cecil, at
                        which certain amendments proposed for the Covenant of the League of Nations
                        had been discussed. Mr. Miller stated that these proposed amendments were of
                        two kinds, those which had been agreed upon and those which had been
                        discussed but had not been approved. The first category of those amendments
                        could briefly be summarized as follows: <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>A provision was added in Article 3 whereby an increase of
                                membership on the Executive Council is facilitated. This amendment
                                had in view the eventual possibility of Germany and Russia being
                                represented on the Executive Council.</item>

                            <item>A provision was added to Article 4 in which it was expressly
                                stated that all decisions of the Executive Council should be by
                                unanimous vote unless otherwise specified.</item>

                            <item>Article 7 which deals with the admission of new States to the
                                League of Nations was so amended as to be positive in its sense
                                rather than negative.</item>
                            <label>(4)</label>
                            <item>The word “permission” in the last sentence of paragraph 1 of
                                Article 8 was changed to read “concurrence”. The British suggestion
                                to change the words “the permission of” to “notice to” was not
                                accepted.</item>
                            <label>(5)</label>
                            <item>Article 11 was amended to become mandatory by the substitution of
                                the words “the League shall” for the words “the High Contracting
                                Parties reserve the right” in the first paragraph.</item>
                            <label>(6)</label>
                            <item>To article 14 was added a clause providing that the permanent
                                court of International Justice should also consider all matters
                                referred to it by the Executive Council or the Body of
                                Delegates.</item>
                            <label>(7)</label>
                            <item>In the second paragraph of Article 15 the words “and that if any
                                party shall refuse so to comply, the Council shall propose the
                                measures necessary to give effect to the recommendation” were struck
                                out.</item>
                            <label>(8)</label>
                            <item>To Article 17 a clause was inserted stating that nothing in the
                                Covenant of the League of Nations should be so construed as to force
                                a State to be a mandatory of the League.</item>
                            <label>(9)</label>
                            <item>Articles 18, 20 and 21 were assimilated into one Article for the
                                sake of uniformity in the drafting.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Two suggested amendments were also discussed but disapproved. The first was a
                        proposed amendment whereby any nation could withdraw from the League after
                        giving two years notice. This amendment was abandoned because of the
                        conviction that the French Government would not adhere to it, but it is to
                        be proposed. The second was a proposed amendment involving the weakening of
                        Article 10. Both Canada and Australia were particularly interested in this
                        amendment, but inasmuch as Article 10 was being relied on absolutely by
                        France to guarantee her against future aggression from Germany, it was not
                        accepted.</p>
                    <p>9. Colonel House entered the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Colonel House stated that he had just had an interview with Clemenceau and
                        that from this interview it was apparent that an “impasse” had been reached.
                        The French were apparently not satisfied with the League of Nations as it
                        stood and desired a more explicit guarantee that both England and the United
                        States would come to the assistance of France in case of her invasion at any
                        time in the future. M. Clemenceau had practically threatened that in case
                        such a clause were not added to the League of Nations, the French Government
                        would assume a waiting role and do nothing to further the signing of peace.
                        Mr. Lansing observed that in case France did this there would be nothing
                        left for the United States to do except to sign a separate peace. Colonel
                        House admitted that this was true, but felt that such a move would be
                        extremely unfortunate. He therefore requested all the Commissioners to
                        consider the matter very earnestly <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0161"
                        />and endeavor to draft, if possible, some modification to the Covenant of
                        the League of Nations which might satisfy the French views.</p>
                    <p>10. Colonel House read the draft of a telegram which he suggested that the
                        Mission send to the American Minister at Stockholm for transmission to Mr.
                        Bullitt. Inasmuch as this draft telegram referred to certain messages which
                        had been sent; by Mr. Bullitt to the Mission, and which all the
                        Commissioners had not yet had an opportunity to study, they reserved their
                        decision as to the advisability of sending the draft telegram in
                        question.</p>

                    <p>1. Mr. Lansing discussed an embarrassing incident which had arisen the
                        previous day in regard to Marshal Foch’s presence at the Council of Ten. The
                        Commissioners were not quite certain as to the exact status of Marshal Foch,
                        but General Bliss understood that he had been appointed as a Delegate from
                        France because of his position as Commander-in-Chief on the Western front.
                        It was pointed out that this virtually gave to France a sixth Delegate to
                        the Peace Conference, which was an advantage over the other Powers.</p>
                    <p>2. Mr. White mentioned the fact that Lieut. Condon had just returned and had
                        given him some very interesting information in regard to sentiment in the
                        United States. It appeared that there was tremendous interest in the United
                        States in regard to the Peace Conference, and that Lieut. Condon had been
                        asked by the Kansas City Chamber of Commerce to speak on several occasions,
                        which he had done. Lieut. Condon emphasized to Mr. White the necessity of
                        having persons in sympathy with what the Peace Conference was trying to
                        accomplish go to different parts of the United States to explain just what
                        was being done. This was particularly important because of the fact that
                        such papers as the <hi rend="italic">Kansas City Star</hi> had not even
                        published the text of the Covenant of the League of Nations, and was
                        constantly opposing it.</p>
                    <p>3. Mr. Lansing read a statement which he suggested should be telegraphed to
                        the United States in order to assist in the raising of the <pb n="126"
                            xml:id="pg_126" facs="0162"/>next Liberty Loan. With one or two slight
                        modifications, the Commissioners approved of this statement.</p>
                    <p>4. Mr. White observed that he had on the previous day had a conversation with
                        Mr. Baruch, in which Mr. Baruch had informed him that Mr. Gompers was unable
                        to live in Paris as he claimed he should on 40 francs a day. Mr. Gompers had
                        therefore told Mr. Baruch that he thought it would be only right if he and
                        his secretary were to be given $25.00 a day for living expenses from the
                        Commission, payable from the day of his arrival in Paris. The Commissioners
                        felt that this demand was very extreme, but suggested to Mr. White that he
                        convey to Mr. Gompers that any request of this sort should be submitted to
                        the Commissioners in writing.</p>
                    <p>5. Mr. White stated that he had had a conversation with Colonel House during
                        which the latter had shown him a suggested text for an agreement between
                        France, Great Britain and the United States which he thought would satisfy
                        M. Clemenceau. The Commissioners discussed the drafting of this text, and
                        felt that the wording could be much improved upon. They therefore drew up a
                        substitute text. The Commissioners further requested Mr. Herter to submit
                        this text to Colonel House with the statement to the effect that in their
                        opinion the subject matter thereof was most prejudicial to the whole
                        structure of the League of Nations, and to the ideal for which the United
                        States entered the war, and that they therefore would desire further time to
                        consider it. They also wished it clearly understood that in redrafting the
                        text they were not expressing any opinion upon the principle involved.</p>
                    <p>6. Memorandum No. 173 was read recommending (1) that any relief measures
                        taken with regard to Russia should be part of a definite program in respect
                        to this country; (2) that an undertaking such as the feeding of Petrograd
                        should be a Governmental affair since the Red Cross had hot sufficient funds
                        and (3) that the attached memorandum in regard to the whole Russian
                        situation should be considered.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners agreed that any relief measure for Russia should be part of
                        a definite program, but were very doubtful whether at the present time the
                        United States had sufficient funds available to undertake such measures on
                        any adequate scale. They admitted that it was a matter which the Red Cross
                        would be unable to handle.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the memorandum attached, they agreed that it would be advisable
                        to feed and give prompt economic assistance to Finland, Esthonia, Poland,
                        Czecho-Slovakia and the liberated sections of Latvia and Lithuania, but were
                        unable to pass upon the feasibility of such a large program. They
                        disapproved of the recommendations that instructions be sent to General
                        Pershing or to General Kernan such as those recommended.</p>
                    <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0163"/>
                    <p>In regard to the positive measures set forth, the Commissioners concurred
                        except in so far as any declaration setting out the American policy should
                        be changed to a declaration setting out the policy of the Associated
                        Governments. They felt in regard to all these statements, however, that they
                        were ends to be arrived at but that the means to further these ends
                        constituted the gravest difficulties. For instance, they would be very glad
                        to learn how an effective armistice could be insured on all fronts, or how
                        food and medical supplies etc., could be distributed on a democratic basis.
                        They likewise would like to know whether there is sufficient food available
                        for carrying out an effective <hi rend="italic">ravitaillement</hi> program
                        in Russia and whether satisfactory financial arrangements could be made to
                        pay for this food in view of the fact that Congress will not be convened for
                        some months.</p>
                    <p>7. Memorandum No. 171 was read with regard to the desire of Mr. Norman H.
                        Davis to know the wishes of the Commission with respect to establishing
                        credits in favor of the Poles for the purchase of material for the Polish
                        army as well as the civilian population. The Commissioners approved of the
                        establishment of credits for the purpose indicated by Mr. Davis.</p>
                    <p>8. Memorandum No. 170 was read with regard to a suggestion made by Mr. Norman
                        H. Davis that Mr. Hayden B. Harris be sent to Poland to report on the
                        financial and economic situation. The Commissioners agreed that it would be
                        well to have Mr. Harris go to Poland for the purpose indicated.</p>
                    <p>9. A memorandum was read which had been prepared by Mr. Stabler in regard to
                        the dissatisfaction caused among certain delegates from South America
                        because of the alleged unfair representation of South America on the
                        Financial and Economic Commissions. The Commissioners requested that the
                        substance of the memorandum in question be incorporated in a much reduced
                        form in a letter to the President with a request for his views in the
                        premises. The Commissioners added that they would be willing to have
                        inserted in this letter a statement to the effect that if the Latin and
                        South American republics were not given larger representations on these
                        Commissions we would receive a large part of the blame and the relations
                        between the United States and Central and South America might be impaired
                        thereby. The Commissioners themselves were quite disposed to insist on a
                        decent representation for these republics.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners agreed that the question of giving a dinner for the Central
                        and South American Delegates should be postponed until the answer had been
                        received from the President in regard to the above mentioned matter.</p>
                    <p>10. Memorandum No. 175 was read with regard to the question of newspaper
                        correspondents in Germany. The Commissioners agreed <pb n="128"
                            xml:id="pg_128" facs="0164"/>that in view of the fact that the Peace
                        Treaty would shortly be signed, it would be inadvisable to take any steps to
                        prevent these newspaper men from trading with the enemy and that under no
                        circumstances should the State Department be advised to exercise any
                        regulatory supervision over the activities of these newspaper men.</p>
                    <p>11. Memorandum No. 165<note n="78" xml:id="d35fn78">See meeting of March 18,
                            minute 3, <ref target="#pg_120">p. 120</ref>.</note> regarding the
                        sending of a Mission to Turkey which had been read at a meeting of the
                        Commissioners on March 18th was brought up for reconsideration. The
                        personnel of this Commission had been cut down to five officials, … being
                        struck from the original list and the Commissioners approved of the sending
                        of the Mission consisting of five officials and four Field Clerks, and
                        believed that a sum of $18,500 to pay the expenses of this Mission would not
                        be excessive.</p>
                    <p>12. Memorandum No. 176 was read with regard to the employment by Mr. Jerome
                        D. Greene, Secretary of the Reparation Committee, of Lieut. R. S. Boardman
                        of the American Red Cross for two or three hours a day. The Commissioners
                        approved of Lieut. Boardman being so employed, and believed that 4 francs an
                        hour would not be an excessive stipend.</p>
                    <p>13. Memorandum No. 177 was read in which Mr. Williams suggested that a draft
                        of a telegram for transmission to the State Department in regard to the
                        attitude of the United States Government toward the Siberian situation be
                        sent to the President for his approval. The Commissioners felt that they
                        would be unable to render any decision in this matter until the last
                        sentence of the first paragraph of Mr. Polk’s telegram of March 9th had been
                        cleared up. In that sentence Mr. Polk spoke of the support the United States
                        was now lending the authorities in Siberia in the shipping of supplies
                        including military equipment and railway materials. The Commissioners were
                        not aware as to what sort of military equipment was being sent to the
                        authorities in Siberia nor for what purpose this equipment was being used.
                        It was therefore requested that a telegram be sent immediately to Mr. Polk
                        asking him to furnish them with the necessary data in the premises.<note

                    <p>14. At the meeting Mr. Herter read a telegram from Mr. Bullitt as well as a
                        memorandum from Dr. Lord in regard to Captain Pettit. The Commissioners
                        agreed that in view of the information in question, all of Mr. Bullitt’s
                        recommendations should be complied with, with the exception perhaps of
                        giving to Sergeant Krause a courier <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0165"
                        />passport. This should be done only in case it were absolutely
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>15. Information Memorandum No. 43 was read in regard to the amendment which
                        it was reported that the Japanese Delegation would propose to the
                        constitution of the League of Nations. This memorandum read as follows:
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Equality between nations being a basic principle of the League of
                                Nations, the High Contracting Powers agree to accord, as soon as
                                possible, to all aliens, nationals of states members of the League,
                                equal and just treatment, making no distinction, either in law or in
                                fact, on account of race or nationality.”</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The Commissioners requested that a copy of Information Memorandum No. 43 be
                        given to each one of them for further study.</p>
                    <p>16. Mr. Herter inquired whether, in view of the altered situation in Germany,
                        there would now be any objection for Mr. Osborne to travel through that
                        country on his way from Copenhagen to Paris. The Commissioners decided that
                        it would be better for Mr. Osborne not to travel to Paris via Germany but to
                        come by water if possible.</p>

                    <p>1. The Commissioners requested Colonel Olds to inform them just what
                        assistance was being rendered by the Red Cross to the States bordering upon
                        Russia. He explained that there was at present a small Red Cross
                        organization in Siberia as well as an organization with the American Forces
                        at Archangel, likewise a Red Cross Commission was at present in Poland and
                        another in Germany assisting with the repatriation of Russian prisoners of
                        War. Otherwise there was no Red Cross assistance being given to the various
                        factions composing the Soviet Government. Requests had, however, been
                        received from Denikin’s army for American Red Cross assistance, and Colonel
                        Olds wished to learn of the attitude of the Commissioners in this
                        matter.</p>
                    <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0166"/>
                    <p>The Commissioners requested Colonel Olds to put in the form of a memorandum
                        the whole question as it appeared to him, together with such recommendations
                        as he might have to make. Colonel Olds agreed to do this and then
                        withdrew.</p>
                    <p>2. The Commissioners discussed the question of the suggested agreement
                        between France, England and the United States which had been brought up at
                        their meeting on the previous day. They all expressed themselves very
                        strongly against the principle involved in concluding such an agreement, and
                        felt that the whole structure of the League of Nations would be most
                        seriously compromised thereby. Mr. White was of the opinion that the time
                        had come for a definite showdown with the French, and that unless an
                        amicable agreement could be reached, we should sign a separate peace. The
                        Commissioners felt that it was most essential that they should discuss the
                        whole situation with the President in the very near future.</p>
                    <p>3. A memorandum prepared by Dr. Lord was read, suggesting that owing to the
                        various successive steps which would have to be agreed upon in concluding
                        the final armistice between the Poles and the Ukrainians it would be well to
                        have this whole matter referred by the Council of Ten to the Inter-Allied
                        Polish Commission in Paris. This course was agreed upon and Mr. Lansing took
                        charge of the memorandum in order to bring the question up at the meeting of
                        the Council of Ten in the afternoon.</p>
                    <p>4. Information Memorandum No. 44 was read with regard to the status of Lt.
                        Col. Arthur Dryhurst Budd. The Commissioners agreed that Col. Budd should be
                        informed that he had absolutely no connection with the American Commission
                        to Negotiate Peace and that the Secretary General should likewise be
                        directed to inform him that the Commissioners very seriously doubted the
                        propriety of any American army officer acting as technical delegate for
                        Panama or any other foreign country. They felt that such a statement would
                        be sufficient to cause Col. Budd to either resign from the army or give up
                        his position as technical delegate to the Panaman Delegation, but that in
                        case he took neither one of these courses, further action compelling him to
                        do so would be necessary.</p>
                    <p>5. Mr. Herter read a memorandum which he had received from Mr. Story quoting
                        a press report received from Prof. Coolidge respecting an order which it was
                        alleged that the British Naval representative in Hungary had issued that no
                        ship could sail on the Danube without the permission of the Czecho-Slovak
                        Government etc. The Commissioners requested that a letter be sent to Mr.
                        Balfour, Mr. Lansing offering to sign this letter, inquiring whether the
                        alleged order had in fact been issued. If this should prove to be true, the
                        Commissioners <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0167"/>felt that the
                        question should immediately be discussed by the Council of Ten.</p>
                    <p>6. Information Memorandum No. 45 was read regarding the condition of Lord
                        Northcliffe and was noted by the Commissioners with interest.</p>
                    <p>7. Information Memorandum No. 46 was read with regard to the French Embassy
                        visaing passports of American citizens traveling on official business, and
                        was noted by the Commissioners with interest.</p>
                    <p>8. Information Memorandum No. 47 was read quoting a telegram received from
                        the Naval Attaché at Madrid, and was noted with interest by the
                        Commissioners.</p>

                    <p>1. Mr. White observed that in a conversation which he had had with Colonel
                        House that morning, Colonel House inquired whether or not any steps had been
                        taken towards actually drawing up the Peace Treaty. Mr. Lansing stated that
                        this had already been begun by Major James Brown Scott of the American
                        Commission, and Mr. Hurst of the British Commission. General Bliss felt that
                        if a draft of a Treaty of Peace with Germany could be laid on the table
                        before the Council of Ten or the Plenary Conference, and that then the
                        Conference should be asked what clauses it wished added to this Treaty of
                        Peace, the whole Peace problem would be accelerated considerably. <seg
                            type="margin">Peace Treaty</seg></p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing observed that in connection with the above, he thought the time
                        had now passed when the Germans would sign any Treaty of Peace without
                        examining it in great detail, and wishing to discuss its provisions. General
                        Bliss agreed that this was probably so, and likewise felt that the Germans
                        should be given a hearing because they might be able to adduce convincing
                        arguments why this or that clause should be changed. This he felt was
                        particularly true in the case of the military and navy terms.</p>
                    <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0168"/>
                    <p>2. General Bliss inquired why three officers whom it had been decided to send
                        to assist General Kernan on the Inter-Allied Mission in Poland had been
                        returned to their organizations. Mr. Lansing explained that this had
                        undoubtedly been done because of the fact that at a previous meeting of the
                        Commissioners they had decided that the officers in question should not go
                        to Poland unless one or two of them spoke French fluently. General Bliss
                        asked that he be allowed to speak to Mr. Grew about this matter, and at the
                        suggestion of Mr. Lansing undertook to make himself alone responsible for
                        the sending of suitable officers to Poland. <seg type="margin">Officers to
                            Poland</seg></p>
                    <p>3. Memorandum No. 171 was read giving the arguments for and against the
                        sending of a Mission of further observers into Germany. After considering
                        both sides of this question, the Commissioners felt that for the present at
                        least, it would be inadvisable to send any further observers into Germany.
                        Moreover, General Bliss offered to ask General Pershing whether he would
                        instruct General Harries, who is at present in Berlin, to send in political
                        reports to the Mission at frequent intervals. <seg type="margin">Sending
                            Further Observers to Germany</seg></p>
                    <p>4. Memorandum No. 172 was read with regard to the assignment of Captain
                        Alexander Henderson for work with Mr. Norman H. Davis. The Commissioners
                        approved of the assignment of Captain Henderson for the purpose indicated.

                    <p>5. Memorandum No. 173 was read in which Mr. Stabler inquired as to whether
                        the Commissioners knew anything of the Mexican Minister’s personality or
                        standing inasmuch as the latter was about to call on Mr. Stabler. The
                        Commissioners observed that they had nothing particularly to indicate to Mr.
                        Stabler in this matter, but General Bliss remarked that the Mexican Minister
                        had previously served on the Mexican Mission which General Bliss knew well,
                        and that he was a very able man and most friendly to the United States. <seg

                    <p>6. Information Memorandum No. 48 was read regarding Lt. Foster’s and Mr.
                        Harris’ trip to Poland. The Commissioners agreed that in view of the fact
                        that the Foreign Office had not reserved two places for Lt. Foster and Mr.
                        Harris it would be well for the Embassy to bring this matter to the
                        attention of the French Government in order to indicate that the Mission had
                        observed with regret the action of the French Government in the premises.

                    <p>1. Mr. White stated that he had just had a conference with Colonel House, and
                        that he later had given him certain bits of information with regard to the
                        President and the President’s attitude upon certain current questions. The
                        President had been unable to have the proposed amendment with regard to
                        Article 10 of the Covenant of the League of Nations passed which safeguarded
                        the Monroe Doctrine because Lloyd George was opposed to it. Lloyd George
                        felt that the insertion of such an Article would be giving to the United
                        States a special prerogative, and would likewise localize the League of
                        Nations. Moreover, Lloyd George had not yet been able to reach a
                        satisfactory agreement with the President in regard to the ship-building
                        program of the two countries, and that was undoubtedly his fundamental
                        objection to making a concession to the United States. Colonel House had
                        observed that in view of the fact that Lord Robert Cecil and Mr. Balfour
                        were both willing to pass the amendment in question, the President had
                        decided to see Mr. Lloyd George personally in the hope of getting him
                        finally to consent to it. <seg type="margin">Covenant League of
                            Nations</seg></p>
                    <p>2. Mr. White observed that through Colonel House he had learned that the
                        President appeared to be in favor of giving to France the guarantee which
                        she desired through a triple alliance. England was resolved to give this
                        guarantee whether the United States did or not. Mr. White said that he told
                        Colonel House that in the opinion of the other three Commissioners such an
                        alliance would be extremely unfortunate, and absolutely fatal to the success
                        of the League of Nations. Colonel House had replied that he would bring this
                        view to the attention of the President. <seg type="margin">Triple
                            Alliance</seg></p>
                    <p>3. Mr. White stated that he had been informed that the President wished to
                        send Mr. Richard Crane and Mr. King, the President of the Oberlin College,
                        as field observers to Syria. The President felt these two men were
                        particularly qualified to go to Syria because they knew nothing about it.
                        Mr. Lansing asked Mr. Herter to see whether there was any written record of
                        the President’s wishes in this matter of the disposal of the <pb n="134"
                            xml:id="pg_134" facs="0170"/>Commission in order that the question of
                        the whole Mission to Turkey could be settled accordingly. <seg type="margin"
                            >Field Observers to Syria</seg></p>
                    <p>4. Mr. White further stated that the President had decided to appoint Mr.
                        Buckler as American Minister to Poland, but that he and Mr. White did not
                        favor this appointment. He felt that although Mr. Buckler had many excellent
                        qualifications, he is not fitted to be a Minister of the United States, and
                        that Mr. Buckler realized his own limitations in this respect. Mr. Lansing
                        felt that in any case it would be best to have the offer made to Mr. Buckler
                        and if the latter should then decide he was not fitted for the position, he
                        should then refuse to accept it. <seg type="margin">Appointment American
                            Minister to Poland</seg></p>
                    <p>5. Captain Roosevelt<note n="80" xml:id="d38fn80">Captain Nicholas Roosevelt,
                            of the Coolidge Mission.</note> and Prof. Coolidge entered the meeting.
                        Mr. Lansing asked Captain Roosevelt, who had left Budapest the day after the
                        change in Government, to explain the reasons for the change in the
                        Government. Captain Roosevelt explained in some detail the reasons for the
                        resignation of the Karolyi Government, detailing the successive steps taken
                        by the Allied and Associated Governments which had aroused a very strong
                        national feeling of resentment among the Hungarians and had culminated in
                        the recent <hi rend="italic">coup d’état</hi>. The final delineation of the
                        neutral zone between Hungarians and the Rumanians marked the breaking point.
                        When Colonel Vyx<note n="81" xml:id="d38fn81">Lieutenant Colonel Vyx of the
                            French Army, military representative of the Allied powers in

                        should withdraw behind the line in question, Karolyi stated that no
                        Government in Hungary could be found that would agree to such conditions. A
                        revolution must of necessity follow. Captain Roosevelt further explained
                        that Colonel Vyx had shown great tact in the handling of this matter, and
                        that he was in no way responsible for the final outcome. <seg type="margin"
                            >Hungarian Situation</seg></p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing inquired what action Prof. Coolidge and Captain Roosevelt now
                        believed to be proprietory [<hi rend="italic">proper?</hi>] under the
                        circumstances. Captain Roosevelt explained that before he left Budapest the
                        officer representing Great Britain on the Inter-Allied Mission there had
                        told him that 10,000 Allied troops would be enough. If it were possible to
                        send these, Captain Roosevelt felt that the problem could be solved. If
                        however, these could not be sent it would be possible to allow the Czechs
                        and the Rumanians to declare war on the Hungarians, in which case a very
                        cruel and bloody war would undoubtedly ensue. Mr. Lansing felt that the
                        first alternative would be undesirable since we have had disastrous results
                        in each case where we had sent a small body of troops to settle conditions
                        in some restless locality. The second alternative, however, appears even <pb
                            n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0171"/>worse since it would merely mean
                        the beginning of a series of wars in central Europe which would antagonize
                        the peoples to a greater extent than they were antagonized already.</p>
                    <p>General Bliss stated that he felt very strongly that we had no reason to
                        change our attitude towards Hungary merely because a change of Government
                        had occurred there which did not suit us very well. He stated that if the
                        present Government maintained order there is no reason why we should not
                        deal with it just as we had with the previous government. Moreover, if the
                        present government refused to obey the injunction of Peace Conference and
                        retired its troops behind the designated neutral zone, but preferred to
                        fight with the Rumanians, we should then refuse to give any assistance to
                        the Rumanians regardless of how greatly such a step might be misinterpreted
                        by the other nation [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. The line of the neutral
                        zone which had been drawn was absolutely unjust, and we should not make
                        matters worse by enforcing an extremely unjust decision by force of arms. We
                        should have to reconsider our decision in regard to the boundaries of
                        Hungary. Furthermore, if we sent troops to assist the Rumanians against the
                        Hungarians we would have made the first step toward involving the American
                        army into a series of European wars which would rapidly stretch from the
                        Atlantic to the Ural mountains.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners realized how difficult it would be to revoke a decision
                        which had formerly been reached by the Peace Conference, but felt that
                        whereas we had once been fooled into agreeing to a rotten decision, we
                        should no longer have the injustice of backing it up by force of arms. They
                        felt that the whole situation should be put up to the President
                        immediately.</p>
                    <p>General Bliss agreed to draft a memorandum for the President on the whole
                        subject, but assured the other Commissioners that if he drafted the
                        memorandum it would be red hot. Mr. White and Mr. Lansing assured him that
                        they would back him up on anything that he wrote as it could not exaggerate
                        their feelings in the matter. Mr. Lansing also agreed to telephone
                        immediately to the President to request that no decision be arrived at at
                        the Quai d’Orsay until the President had received General Bliss’
                        memorandum.</p>
                    <p>6. Memorandum No. 174 was read regarding a letter which had been received
                        from Mr. Guy H. Oyster, Secretary to Mr. Samuel Gompers, requesting that
                        both he and Mr. Gompers be given $25.00 a day for living expenses from the
                        date of their arrival in Paris until March 26th. The Commissioners requested
                        that this matter be put up to the President because of the political
                        question involved. They requested moreover that in any letter to the
                        President it be stated that they were willing to approve of paying Mr.
                        Gompers the $25.00 per day which he demanded but that they felt that his
                        Secretary <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0172"/>Mr. Oyster should only be
                        given 40 francs a day. They would likewise care to have it stated that they
                        did not approve of Mr. Gompers’ and Mr. Oyster’s transportation expenses
                        from and to the United States being paid by the Commission because those two
                        gentlemen had come over on business in no way connected with the State
                        Department, and had merely remained in Paris a certain length of time to
                        assist the Conference. It should also be pointed out that neither Mr.
                        Gompers nor Mr. Oyster received any compensation from the Commission for the
                        services that they rendered during 8 weeks in Paris, and that possibly the
                        President would care to have some special remuneration offered to them.</p>
                    <p>7. Memorandum No. 175 was read with regard to the status of Lt. Col. Budd
                        with the Delegation from Panama. The Commissioners requested that the
                        further papers in this case, including Mr. White’s letter to Mr. Burgos<note
                            n="82" xml:id="d38fn82">Of the Panamanian delegation.</note> about
                        Colonel Budd, be gathered together for consideration at the next meeting.

                    <p>8. Memorandum No. 176 was read quoting a letter from Mr. Hoover in which he
                        asked for an expression of the views of the Commissioners in regard to
                        sending certain food stuffs into Hungary at the present time. The
                        Commissioners all agreed that there was absolutely no reason why this food
                        should not go to the Present Hungarian Government, and likewise felt that
                        pressure should be brought to bear on the Serbian Government to permit it to
                        pass through. General Bliss remarked, however, that he understood that this
                        whole question had been taken up at a meeting of the Economic Commission on
                        the previous day, and that a decision in the sense of the one reached by the
                        Commissioners had been arrived at at that time. <seg type="margin">Shipping

                    <p>9. Memorandum No. 177 was read quoting a letter received by the Secretary
                        General from Admiral Benson with regard to a recommendation made by
                        Rear-Admiral Niblack to the effect that the blockade should be raised
                        immediately in the Eastern Mediterranean. The Commissioners all agreed
                        heartily that the blockade in the Eastern Mediterranean should be raised as
                        soon as possible. They are not quite certain, however, as to the next step
                        which should be taken in order to effect the raising of this blockade, and
                        inquired whether there had been any discussion of the matter by the Economic
                        Council. They requested that the Secretary General ascertain to whom their
                        decision in this matter should most properly be communicated, and if it was
                        necessary that it be sent to the President, they asked that the Secretary
                        General draft a suitable letter. <seg type="margin">Blockade Eastern

                        Weller to the Commission for duty with. Major Tyler. The Commissioners were
                        quite disposed to permit the assignment of Lt. Weller to the Commission for
                        the purpose indicated, provided it was finally decided that Lt. King should
                        leave for Syria. It appears to the Commissioners, however, that if Lt. King
                        were not to be sent to Syria it would be unnecessary to have Lt. Weller
                        added to the Commission. <seg type="margin">Assignment Lt. Weller to Major

                    <p>11. Memorandum No. 179 was read regarding a request made by Lt. Col. Riggs,
                        in charge of a Mission to Southern Russia, for a further allotment of
                        $15,000 to cover the necessary expenses of his Mission. The Commissioners
                        requested that they be furnished with a short history of the Mission in
                        question, indicating the make up of the personnel of the Mission, its
                        present whereabouts, the nature of the reports which it is sending in up to
                        date, and a general estimate as to its usefulness at this time when it is
                        reported that the Bolsheviks will shortly be in control of most of Southern
                        Russia. <seg type="margin">Regarding Mission to Southern Russia</seg></p>
                    <p>12. Memorandum No. 180 was read regarding an Inter-Allied Congress to study
                        questions in Social Hygiene in the Reclamation of Regions Devastated by the
                        War. Devastated by The Commissioners felt that there was no action for war

                        a central Anti-Bolsheviki propaganda office in Lausanne. The Commissioners
                        felt Office that it would be impossible to express any opinion on this
                        matter until they had before them a comprehensive outline of the proposed
                        scheme. <seg type="margin">Central Bolsheviki Anti Propaganda

                            Wilson, Lloyd George, Clemenceau and Orlando, and the discussions were
                            all held in English. Mr. Orlando, however, did not understand English,
                            and it was therefore necessary for Mr. Clemenceau to translate not only
                            what he said, but also what President Wilson and Lloyd George said. Mr.
                            Orlando was therefore never certain as to whether he was being given the
                            correct impression in the discussions. <seg type="margin">Italian

                            of having the account in question paid by the Commission, and stated
                            that in future if similar accounts were rendered by members of the

                            Mr. Grew would automatically be approved by the Commissioners, but that
                            in case Mr. Grew was doubtful, at any time, the Commissioners would be

                    <p>1. Memorandum No. 189 was read regarding application made to the Commission
                        by Dr. C. A. Harte of the Y. M. C. A., for assistance in getting four Y. M.
                        C. A. workers started from Paris to Germany in order to provide educational
                        facilities and recreation for Russian prisoners. The Commissioners felt that
                        there would be no objection to allowing four Y. M. C. A. workers to go into
                        Germany, and stated that they were therefore willing to give the necessary
                        assistance to Dr. Harte in obtaining the passports for these workers. <seg

                    <p>2. Memorandum No. 190 was read. This Memorandum was taken up on March 27th as
                        well as a draft of telegram to the Department of State regarding the
                        proposed Mission to Turkey and Syria. This whole question has now been held
                        up because of the rumored appointment by the President of Messrs. King and
                        Crane as the American representatives to go on some sort of a Mission to the
                        Near-East. As it has been impossible up to date, however, to ascertain just
                        what Mission the President desired the two above named gentlemen to go on,
                        or just what their sphere of investigation is to be, it is impossible for
                        the Commissioners to take any action in regards to the proposed Mission to
                        Turkey. As soon as all the details are available with regard to the purpose
                        of the trip which Messrs. King and Crane are about to take it will be
                        possible for the Commissioners to reconsider these two documents. <seg

                    <p>3. Memorandum No. 191 was read regarding the possibility of reducing Mr.
                        Sweetser’s salary now that Mr. Ray Stannard Baker had returned to Paris. The
                        Commissioners felt that it would be distinctly unfair to reduce Mr.
                        Sweetser’s salary in view of the excellent services which he had rendered.
                        It is therefore to continue at the present rate. <seg type="margin"

                    <p>4. Memorandum No. 192 was read regarding a request made by the Delegation of
                        the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes that a Mission of investigation be sent to
                        Spalato to examine the facts in the case of reported occurrence in that
                        town. The Commissioners felt that they were unable to make and Slovenes any
                        decision in this matter at the present time. They request that this fact be
                        brought to the attention of the Secretary General of the Peace Conference,
                        together with the statement that inasmuch as it is stated by Mr. Pachitch
                        that American officers were witnesses of all the acts alleged to have been
                        committed by the Italians, the American Mission was investigating these
                        facts and will be glad to communicate a decision in the premises at a later
                        date. <seg type="margin">Mission of Investigation to Spalato as Requested by

                    <p>The Commissioners further request that an effort be made to ascertain just
                        what officers were in Spalato on the dates in question, and <pb n="141"

                    <p>5. Memorandum No. 193 was read inquiring whether the Commissioners would
                        receive the Commission of the American Jewish Congress which is now in
                        Paris, and if so at what time and date. The Commissioners agreed that they
                        would be glad to see the Commission in question on Wednesday morning April
                        2nd at 10:30 o’clock. <seg type="margin">Commission of American-Jewish

                    <p>6. Memorandum No. 194 was held up because of the uncertainty with regard to
                        the Mission on which Messrs. King and Crane are being sent.</p>
                    <p>7. Memorandum No. 195 was read with regard to the opportunities which should
                        be offered to members of the Commission to invest in bonds of the coming
                        Liberty Loan. The Commissioners approved of the suggested telegram to the
                        Department of State as well as the suggested circular. <seg type="margin"
                            >Liberty Bonds</seg></p>
                    <p>8. Memorandum No. 196 was read in which it was suggested that the Teschen
                        Commission which was operating in the field should be made responsible to
                        the Commission on Polish Affairs of the Peace Conference which is now
                        sitting in Paris. The Commissioners disapproved of such a suggestion,
                        feeling that there was no good reason why the Teschen Commission should be
                        responsible to the Commission on Polish Affairs rather than the Commission
                        on Czecho-Slovak Affairs. They suggested that it would be more advisable to
                        have the Teschen Commission made responsible to the Central Coordination
                        Commission which is presided over by Mr. Tardieu. <seg type="margin"

                    <p>9. Memorandum No. 197 was read inquiring whether the Commissioners approved
                        of the policy of endorsing the application of certain officers for
                        demobilization in France. General Bliss to whom this matter was referred
                        requested that an extremely polite letter be written to General Pershing,
                        submitting to him all the cases within the Commission which had come to the
                        attention of the Secretary General. General Pershing should be asked just
                        what his policy was in this matter for the guidance of the Commission, it
                        being felt that no injustice should be done either to the officers who are
                        serving on the Commission vis-a-vis officers in the field and vice-versa.
                        The Commissioners requested that they be allowed to see this letter before
                        it left in order that they might be familiar with its contents should the
                        question again arise. <seg type="margin">Applications by Officers for

                            objection to transporting General Haller’s Division by rail across
                            Germany, provided the expenses of such transportation were deducted for
                            the payment of food. It was pointed out that by this method General
                            Haller’s Division could be sent to Poland within ten days, and that the
                            whole Dantzig question would be settled. General Bliss also read a

                            The Commissioners felt that there was no further action for them to take

                        representative on the Inter-Allied Teschen Commission. The Commissioners
                        agreed that a salary of $3,000 per annum was not in the slightest degree
                        excessive. <seg type="margin">Salary of Lt. Howe</seg></p>
                    <p>2. Memorandum No. 204 was read with regard to certain measures which Col.
                        Olds, the Commissioner for Europe of the American Red Cross felt that it was
                        advisable to have taken with respect to the epidemic of Spotted Typhus which
                        is reported to be spreading in alarming proportions in certain districts of
                        Russia and Poland. The Commissioners believed that the President was not in
                        a position to make any transfer of medical supplies etc. from the Army to
                        the Red Cross, and thought that this could only be done either through
                        direct purchase by the Red Cross from the Liquidating Commission of the A.
                        E. F. or through some enactment of Congress. They request, however, that the
                        question be discussed with Mr. McNeir in order to ascertain the exact facts
                        in the premises. <seg type="margin">Typhus Epidemic in Russia and
                            Poland</seg></p>
                    <p>3. Memorandum No. 205 was read suggesting that four officers at present
                        attached to the Peace Commission be assigned to Messrs. King and Crane, whom
                        the President had appointed as the American representatives on an
                        Inter-Allied Committee to investigate conditions in those portions of Turkey
                        which are to be permanently separated from Turkey and put under the guidance
                        of Governments acting as Mandatories for the League of Nations. The
                        Commissioners agreed that it would undoubtedly be wise to assign the
                        officers in question to Messrs. King and Crane, but believed that the
                        Commission had no authority to do this unless the last named gentlemen
                        requested this extra assistance. It was therefore suggested that Messrs.
                        King and Crane be spoken to informally about this matter, and that if they
                        concurred in the advisability of being given expert assistance, they write a
                        letter to the Commissioners requesting it. <seg type="margin">Mission to

                    <p>Memorandum No. 190 was also considered in connection with the memorandum in
                        question, and the Commissioners agreed that if any party was to be assigned
                        to Messrs. King and Crane, it would be advisable to refrain from sending Mr.
                        Dominian as a member of this party. They thought that under these
                        circumstances, it would be best for Mr. Dominian to return to the State
                        Department at once where his services appear to be badly needed. They
                        likewise felt that the allotment of $18,500 which they had previously
                        approved should probably be put at the disposal of Messrs. King and
                        Crane.</p>
                    <p>4. Memorandum No. 206 was read to which was attached a suggested letter to
                        General Pershing in regard to the demobilization from the army of officers
                        attached to the Commission. The Commissioners were much pleased with the
                        letter in question, feeling that it exactly expressed their sentiments in
                        this matter. They suggested, however, that a clause be added to the letter
                        stating that because of their views as expressed therein, they were
                        enclosing the papers in the case of Major Thomas and Lieut. James without
                        comment, and for such action as General Pershing might see fit to take. <seg

                            that they were very greatful to him for the information contained in his

                            Dresel to Berlin. General Bliss stated that he had spoken with <pb

                    <p>1. Memorandum No. 209 of March 18th, 1919 was considered, which suggested
                        that an informal and guarded statement be made by the Commissioners to the
                        Press along the lines of a memorandum prepared by Colonel Van Deman, Mr. E.
                        T. Williams, etc., this statement to ostensibly serve to strengthen the
                        conservative forces in the United States against the more radical elements.
                            <seg type="margin">Statement for Press Prepared by Col. Van
                        Deman</seg></p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing felt that it would be very undesirable to make such a statement,
                        and the Commissioners therefore agreed to let the matter rest where it stood
                        without taking any further action.</p>
                    <p>2. Memorandum No. 210 was read in which Dr. Lord suggested that the Council
                        of Four appoint a Commission to investigate and report on all questions
                        properly coming before the Peace Conference relating to the Baltic countries
                        of Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Finland. The Commissioners agreed that it
                        would be very advisable for the Council of Four to appoint such a
                        Commission, and therefore request that a letter be drafted to the President
                        most briefly sketching the arguments given by Dr. Lord, and recommending
                        that such a Commission be appointed. Mr. Lansing stated that he would sign
                        this letter. <seg type="margin">Regarding Commission To Be Appointed To
                            Report on All Questions Relating Baltic countries</seg></p>

                    <p>3. Memorandum No. 211 was read but the Commissioners did not feel that they
                        should act on it until it had been ascertained whether Mr. Lynch were
                        receiving the 40 francs a day given to members of the Commission living
                        outside the Crillon. At the same time, Mr. Lansing observed that he had
                        requested Mr. Grew to furnish him with a memorandum regarding the pay of
                        certain clerks and Secretaries on the Commission, and that he would like to
                        consider the case of Mr. Lynch in connection with such material as Mr. Grew
                        may be able to furnish him in the premises. <seg type="margin">Regarding

                    <p>1. General Kernan who had just returned from Poland that morning gave to the
                        Commissioners a very complete picture of the conditions in Poland in
                        particular, and in Central Europe generally. He dwelt particularly upon the
                        difficulties which he had had in trying to bring about an armistice between
                        the Poles and Ukrainians fighting about Lemberg, likewise the difficulties
                        which he encountered in regard to procedure and methods of work among the
                        various members of the Inter-Allied Mission to Poland. The Commissioners
                        requested General Kernan to draft a short report of his impressions which
                        was to be forwarded to the President. <seg type="margin">General Kernan
                            Reports</seg></p>
                    <p>Mr. White and General Kernan withdrew.</p>
                    <p>2. Memorandum No. 211 was read in which Mr. Bullitt requested that a telegram
                        be sent to the American Consul at Helsingfors instructing the latter to send
                        a message through reliable sources to Tchitcherin respecting Mr. Lansing’s
                        contemplated scheme for relief to Russia. After some discussion, the
                        Commissioners redrafted the telegram in question to read as follows: <seg
                            type="margin">Regarding Relief in Russia</seg>

                    <p>3. Memorandum No. 212 was read regarding the repatriation of Russian
                        prisoners of war in Germany. The Commissioners agreed with the
                        recommendation made by Col. Taylor of the American Red Cross Commission in
                        Germany, namely, that the Russian prisoners in Germany be returned
                        immediately to some part of Russia regardless of whether their return would
                        add to the strength of the Bolshevik forces. The Commissioners were not
                        certain, however, as to what steps they should take in order to facilitate
                        the course recommended by Col. Taylor, and therefore requested further
                        information as to the authorities who were competent to give the
                        Inter-Allied Commission in Berlin proper authorization to bring about the
                        repatriation of these prisoners. <seg type="margin">Recommendation for
                            Repatriation of Russian Prisoners of War in Germany</seg></p>
                    <p>4. Memorandum No. 213 was considered submitting a draft of a telegram to the
                        Department of State in Washington regarding the question of supplying food
                        by the American Red Cross authorities in Berlin to certain persons claiming
                        American citizenship in Germany. The draft of the telegram in question was
                        approved by the Commissioners. <seg type="margin">Supplying Food by Red
                            Cross to Germans Claiming U. S. Citizenship</seg></p>
                    <p>5. Memorandum No. 214 was read regarding the advisability of having the Red
                        Cross in Washington publish the substance of a telegram which it had
                        received containing certain information with regard to the situation in
                        Siberia and European Russia. The Commissioners felt that it would be
                        inadvisable for either the American Commission to Negotiate Peace or the
                        State Department to give its approval to the publication of the information
                        in question. They further felt that the majority of the reports that were
                        received, though always stated to be based on reliable evidence proved to be
                        incorrect and overdrawn. They therefore felt that in any reply to be made to
                        the State Department in the premises it should be stated that the Mission
                        did not approve of the publication of the information in question. <seg

                    <p>6. Memorandum No. 215 was read recommending that Prof. Coolidge be granted an
                        additional allotment of $15,000 for the expense of his Mission. The
                        Commissioners approved of the authorization of the additional allotment in
                        question. <seg type="margin">Additional Allotment to Prof. Coolidge’s
                            Mission</seg></p>
                    <p>7. Memorandum No. 216 was read inquiring whether it would not be advisable to
                        have a clause inserted in the preliminary Peace Treaty providing for direct
                        restitution to China of the rights in Shantung formerly pertaining to
                        Germany. The Commissioners agreed absolutely that such an article should be
                        inserted, and requested therefore that Mr. Williams and <pb n="150"
                            xml:id="pg_150" facs="0186"/>Major James Brown Scott collaborate in
                        drafting the text of such an article. This text should then be sent to the
                        President for his approval, and for the consideration of the Council of
                        Four. <seg type="margin">Restitution to</seg></p>

                        <item>Mr. Herter read a memorandum prepared by Mr. Westermann in which he
                            inquired whether the quoted statement attributed to the President
                            regarding his attitude toward the Jewish Commonwealth in Palestine was
                            authentic. The Commissioners very much doubt whether the President had
                            ever made any such statement, but requested that it be sent to the
                            President with the statement as to its source. They desired that the
                            President be asked whether this quotation were correct, and that it be
                            added that in case it were not correct, they were of the opinion that it
                            should be denied at once. <seg type="margin">Statement Attributed to

                        <item>Memorandum No. 217 was read to which was appended a draft of a letter
                            prepared by Mr. Grew to the Secretary General of the Peace Conference
                            regarding the use of Italian on the same basis as English and French for
                            all the official reports and clauses to be inserted into the Treaty of
                            Peace. The Commissioners agreed absolutely that it would be unnecessary
                            to include the Italian language with English and French as the official
                            languages, stating that both of the latter languages could be called
                            diplomatic languages, inasmuch as French is the diplomatic language of
                            Europe and English the diplomatic language of the Far East. Italian has
                            no such claim. The Commissioners felt, however, that as this was an
                            international matter of some importance, it should more properly come
                            before some such body as the Council of Ten for final decision. They
                            request therefore that Mr. Grew prepare a letter to Mr. Dutasta<note

                            the present famine conditions in Russia, and to take such other measures
                            as might seem necessary to present that information to the German
                            public. This recommendation was based upon the reports received from
                            Germany to the effect that the lower classes in that country were
                            convinced that they will be able to obtain food from Russia if only they
                            turned Bolshevik and made an alliance with the Russians. The
                            Commissioners approved of the recommendations in question, likewise

                        <item>Memorandum No. 219 was read, to which was appended a memorandum from
                            Dr. Lord to Mr. Grew with regard to the whole question of the suspension
                            of Arms between the Poles and the Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia. The
                            Commissioners request that a copy of the memorandum in question be

                            agreed to sign. This covering letter should call the President’s
                            attention to the fact that the Council of Four [<hi rend="italic"

                    <p>1. The Commissioners discussed the memorandum regarding Mr. Crosby’s
                        investigations of the Financial obligations of the former Austro-Hungarian
                        monarchy. Excerpts from Mr. Norman H. Davis’ letter to Secretary Lansing, of
                        April 11th, and Mr. Crosby’s letter of the same date to Colonel House were
                        read and considered. It was agreed that a letter should be addressed to Mr.
                        Crosby suggesting that he continue his work on the Austro-Hungarian
                        financial problem, and that he be authorized to discuss the matter with
                        Allied representatives in Paris who may be working on the same problem. <seg
                            type="margin">Regarding Financial Obligations of Former Austro-Hungarian

                    <p>2. Memorandum No. 221 was read, together with a copy of a letter which Mr.
                        Davis proposes to send to the Roumanian Premier, Mr. Bratiano, regarding the
                        conditions of the extension of financial assistance to Roumania. Mr. Lansing
                        stated that in his opinion of the question which Mr. Davis had raised did
                        not directly concern the making of peace and therefore was not one which the
                        Commissioners could well deal with at the present time. General Bliss added
                        that if his opinion was asked for he would be inclined to refer to the fact
                        that the Roumanians were apparently seeking to obtain further military
                        supplies from the United States. If credits were to be extended to Roumania
                        for reconstruction and relief purposes the United States should hardly at
                        the same time be extending credits for army purposes. Mr. Dulles stated that
                        the reason for the submission of the memorandum to the Commissioners was
                        presumably because the question of reparation was indirectly involved. Mr.
                        Lansing stated that the priority of claim to reparation money for the
                        repayment of credits extended to Roumania for relief purposes would not be
                        included in the Peace Treaties with Germany, Austria or Hungary, but would
                        result from an arrangement between the United States and Roumania. <seg
                            type="margin">Regarding Extending Financial Assistance to
                        Roumania</seg></p>
                    <p>In regard to the method of procedure, Mr. Lansing felt that in the final
                        analysis the matter should go through diplomatic channels and through the
                        State Department in Washington, not through the Peace Commission.</p>
                    <p>3. The Commissioners approved the recommendation of Memorandum No. 222
                        regarding the possible repatriation of Esthonians now in camps for Russian
                        prisoners in Germany. General Bliss added that the military representatives
                        of the Supreme War Council had recommended the repatriation of all prisoners
                        in Germany from Baltic provinces, subject to the necessary precautions
                        against persons who might spread Bolshevism. Mr. Lansing emphasized the
                        necessity of care in weeding out future Bolshevist propagandists from such
                        repatriated prisoners. <seg type="margin">Regarding Repatriation of
                            Esthonians</seg></p>
                    <p>4. Mr. Dulles brought to the attention of the Commissioners a recent letter
                        from Professor Philip M. Brown in Budapest, giving a description of the
                        character and aims of the communist movement in Budapest. General Bliss read
                        portions of this letter to Mr. Lansing. Prof. Brown emphasized that up to
                        the present there had been no serious disorder, but that the anti-Bourgeois
                        character of the revolution would make a period of “Terror” probable, in
                        case the Bourgeois should endeavor to organize counter movement. <seg
                            type="margin">Regarding Communist Movement in Budapest</seg></p>
                    <p>5. Mr. Lansing stated to General Bliss that he had had a conversation with
                        Mr. Paderewski on Saturday, and in the course of their <pb n="153"
                            xml:id="pg_153" facs="0189"/>conversation had suggested that the best
                        manner of solving the Teschen question was for the representatives of the
                        Poles and Czechs to get together in Paris and work out a possible compromise
                        or at least to reduce the territorial problem to be solved to the narrowest
                        possible limits, and then to indicate a possible arbiter who would be
                        acceptable to both parties. Mr. Lansing stated that he had pointed out to
                        Mr. Paderewski the necessity of friendly cooperation between the Poles and
                        the Czechs, in view of the menace to which both countries were exposed. <seg

                    <p>6. Mr. White entered the meeting.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners approved the recommendation of Memorandum No. 223
                        requesting that inquiry be made through the Embassy regarding alleged
                        negotiations of French officers in the Ukraine, on behalf of the Allied and
                        Associated Governments, as well as the apparent assent of the French
                        government to the proposed negotiations in Paris. <seg type="margin"

                            a message from Mr. Ignatieff, Minister of the Interior of the same
                            government respecting the union of that government with the Omsk
                            government. The Commissioners agreed that it would be unwise for
                            American representatives to be used as a channel of communication
                            between the two gentlemen in question, feeling that it would be better
                            not to be associated so intimately at the present time with the policies
                            of these two governments. Nevertheless, the Commissioners stated that
                            they personally had no objection to the fusing of the two governments in
                            question, but that they did not care to commit themselves officially in
                                <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0190"/>this matter as such a
                            commitment might be interpreted as indicating a strong desire on their

                            its undertaking, it would be better for the Government to take no part
                            whatever in this matter. They are unable to understand, however, why the
                            American Red Cross was not in a position to assist to the extent of one
                            third of the $180,000 required, in view of the numerous sums which it

                        <item>Colonel House observed that the question of Fiume would shortly come
                            up for consideration by the Council of Four, and asked the other
                            Commissioners’ opinions in regard to a certain memorandum on this
                            subject which he had sent down to them on the previous day. The
                            Commissioners discussed <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0191"/>at some
                            length the whole question of principle involved in the settlement of the
                            problem of Fiume, and finally came to a decision as to what, in their
                            opinion, the ultimate disposition of this city, together with its
                            immediate Hinterland should be.<note n="88a" xml:id="d51fn88a">See

                            in Brest. The Commissioners felt that at the time when they had first
                            considered this matter, namely, on March 5th, there was some reason for
                            having the speeches and messages in question printed in the French
                            language, but that inasmuch as the Peace Conference was nearing its end,
                            the same reason no longer existed. They therefore requested that the
                            matter be dropped altogether. <seg type="margin">Speeches and Messages

                            Commonwealth in Palestine. The Commissioners felt that in view of the
                            rather ambiguous phrasing of the President’s reply to an inquiry as to
                            the authenticity of the statement in question it would be safer not to
                            make any official denial thereof. <seg type="margin">Jewish Commonwealth

                            Mission to Syria at the present time. The Commissioners noted carefully
                            the views presented by Drs. Westermann and King, Mr. Crane and Prof.
                            Lybyer in this matter. After some discussion they agreed that it would
                            be best to give up entirely the sending of a purely American mission to
                            Syria at the present time inasmuch as such a mission could scarcely
                            furnish data upon which the Commissioners could base their decisions
                            with regard to the problems in the Near East in a sufficiently short
                            time, and inasmuch as the arrival of such a mission in the Near East
                            might be construed as indicating the special interest of the United
                            States in certain regions and thereby arousing either false hopes or
                            create local disturbances. <seg type="margin">American Commission to

                    <p>Mr. Herter explained to the Commissioners that he had on the previous day, in
                        accordance with a request from Mr. White, taken to the office of Colonel
                        House a memorandum which the latter had submitted to the Commissioners
                        suggesting a compromise settlement on the question of Fiume. Mr. Herter
                        explained that owing to the fact that Colonel House was busy at the moment,
                        he had returned the document in question to Mr. Auchincloss, and at the same
                        time explained to the latter the views of the Commissioners in the premises
                        as brought out at their meeting of the previous day. These views were
                        briefly summed up as being (1) that it was entirely inconsistent to say that
                        the sovereignty of Fiume should revert to Italy, whereas its administration
                        was to be international and many concessions in the city itself were to be
                        granted to the Jugo-Slavs, and, (2) that the whole question involved was one
                        of principle and that it was impossible to compromise with a principle. In
                        this question, either the city should be granted to the Italians and the
                        Jugo-Slavs kept out, or else it should be granted entirely to the Jugo-Slavs
                        and the Italians kept out. The latter solution was the one favored by the
                        Commissioners. Mr. Auchincloss took exception to the views of the
                        Commissioners as stated by Mr. Herter, on the grounds that it was perfectly
                        practicable to place the sovereignty of the city in the hands of the
                        Italians while making the administration international, since such a
                        procedure was recognized in law with regard to many questions of property or
                        estates. He likewise felt that in view of the tremendously strong stand
                        which the Italians had taken in this matter, and in view of the fact that
                        the American experts on this question differed as to its rights and wrongs,
                        a compromise was the only possible solution. When asked what American
                        experts believed that Italy had any valid claim to the city of Fiume, Mr.
                        Auchincloss asserted that both Dr. Mezes and Mr. Miller were of this
                        opinion, but that it was also undoubtedly true that some of our other
                        experts were not.</p>
                    <p>General Bliss then observed that on the previous night Dr. Bowman had shown
                        to him a letter to the President signed by the Chiefs of six Sections of the
                        Bureau of Inquiry, in which those experts expressed to the President their
                        absolute conviction that the Italian claims to the city of Fiume were
                        absolutely unjustified. General Bliss felt that possibly this letter had
                        been instigated because of the feeling among those experts that some
                        compromise was being contemplated.</p>
                    <p>Colonel House entered the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Colonel House stated that he had come to the Commissioners’ meeting for the
                        purpose of discussing the question of Fiume. He stated that the memorandum
                        which he had sent down on the previous day had merely been a suggestion, and
                        that it had not been shown even to the President (Mr. Auchincloss had told
                        Mr. Herter on the previous <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0193"
                        />afternoon that the substance of this suggested compromise had been
                        informally brought to the attention of the Jugo-Slav representatives in
                        Paris and that the indications were that it would be satisfactory to them).
                        Colonel House added that he personally felt that there could be no such
                        solution as a compromise, that the time had gone by when any further
                        compromise could be made.</p>
                    <p>General Bliss stated most emphatically that he wished to go on record as
                        being absolutely opposed to any settlement such as that suggested in Colonel
                        House’s memorandum, that in his opinion such a settlement would bring upon
                        Europe in a very short time a war the proportions and length of which could
                        not be foreseen but which would undoubtedly be most extensive and most
                        disastrous. Mr. Lansing likewise stated that the claims of Italy to this
                        city had been originated only in the last few months, and had been
                        encouraged and fanned into flame within Italy itself by government
                        propaganda. He felt that the Italian threat of revolution, in case these
                        claims were not granted, should not affect the American Delegation in the
                        slightest in their determination as to what would be a just settlement. He
                        likewise stated that it was not the function of the Peace Conference to stop
                        interior revolutions, but to end international wars and that if, because the
                        city of Fiume were not given to Italy, a revolution would break out in
                        Italy, it would certainly be much better than having an international war
                        started up.</p>
                    <p>Colonel House inquired whether the Commissioners likewise disapproved of the
                        decision that had been reached in regard to Dantzig, since the settlement
                        that had been suggested in regard to Fiume was very similar to that which
                        had been agreed upon in regard to Dantzig. General Bliss again stated most
                        emphatically that he believed the Dantzig solution to be unsound, if what
                        the morning papers had published in this matter was to be accepted by him as
                        being the final solution. He was unable to see how it would be possible for
                        the Poles to maintain the sovereignty over Dantzig, and likewise to keep a
                        garrison in that city where the administration would be carried out by the
                        citizens, the majority of whom were German. Conflicts must inevitably arise
                        between the local administration of the city and the Polish garrison.
                        General Bliss then added that in his opinion it would be extremely dangerous
                        for a League of Nations to guarantee the stability of such unsound
                        settlements as appeared to have been agreed upon.</p>
                    <p>Colonel House then asked if the other Commissioners were definitely agreed
                        that Fiume should remain in the hands of the Jugo-Slavs, to which Mr.
                        Lansing, General Bliss and Mr. White affirmed most categorically that it
                        was. Colonel House then added that he was of the same opinion as the other
                        Commissioners, and that it would be best to have the matter out with the
                        Italians as soon as possible, preferably on the next day.</p>

                            the feeding of Russia. Mr. Lansing observed that at the request of the
                            President he had already taken up this question the previous evening
                            with General Bliss, who had already taken up this question with Admiral
                            Benson in turn and who was making the necessary arrangements for having
                            the message in question sent by wireless to Russia. <seg type="margin"

                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>General Bliss stated that a few days previously Mr. Lansing had
                            referred to him a letter from Mr. Hollis, a Commissioner of the American
                            Liquidation Commission in Paris, inquiring whether this government or
                            any of the Allied or Associated governments would object to the sale by
                            the A. E. F. of the surplus stocks of arms, ammunitions and field pieces
                            on a favorable basis to Spain, Poland or Czecho-Slovakia. General Bliss
                            then read a reply which he had written to Mr. Lansing, in which on moral
                            grounds he strongly disapproved of this sale, but felt that legally
                            there could be no such objection. Mr. White and Mr. Lansing heartily
                            agreed with General Bliss in the sentiments expressed in his letter, and
                            requested that a copy of it be sent at once to the President as well as

                        <item>Mr. White read a suggested resolution which Colonel House had shown to
                            him, and which had originated with the British Delegation in Paris, the
                            object of which was to satisfy the Japanese claims for a recognition of
                            racial equality without exactly stating that recognition in so many
                            words. Colonel House had felt that the insertion of such a resolution in
                            the Treaty of Peace might perhaps dissuade the Japanese from bringing up
                            again the question of racial equality at the next Plenary <pb n="159"
                                xml:id="pg_159" facs="0195"/>session of the Conference. The
                            Commissioners disapproved of the wording of the resolution in question,
                            but Mr. Lansing agreed to endeavor to redraft it into such a form as to
                            make it acceptable. Mr. Lansing was not convinced, however, that it
                            would be advisable to insert such a resolution in any case. <seg

                            British troops from Archangel, and with the question of the Plebiscite
                            in Luxembourg respectively. <seg type="margin">British Troops Withdrawal

                        <item>Mr. Herter read a memorandum prepared by Dr. Lord for Mr. Grew,
                            recommending that an American representative be appointed to serve on
                            the sub-commission of the Inter-Allied Commission to Poland, which was
                            at present sitting at Warsaw, for the purpose of watching over the
                            execution of the armistice of February 16th, which armistice ordered the
                            suspension of hostilities between the Germans and Poles in the province
                            of Posen, and fixed a rough line of demarkation between the two sides.
                            General Bliss explained that a short time before General Kernan returned
                            from Poland two American officers had been sent out to Warsaw to assist
                            him, a Lieut. Colonel and a Captain. The Captain had returned the
                            previous day, having missed General Kernan at Warsaw and having not one
                            cent of money in his possession wherewith to continue his existence in
                            Poland. The Commissioners felt that it would be advisable to have the
                            Lieut. Colonel in question, whom they believe to be still in Warsaw,
                            assigned to the sub-commission indicated by Dr. Lord, provided it were
                            possible to make some financial arrangement whereby he could be paid a
                            sufficient amount of money for living expenses. The Commissioners
                            request that the Secretary General be asked to look into this matter and
                            to effect the assignment in question if the satisfactory financial
                            arrangements could be made. <seg type="margin">American Representative

                        <item>Memorandum No. 232 was read in which it was stated that Admiral Knapp
                            had requested that a certain Lt. Commander Callan, an expert in
                            aeronautics, who had recently been ordered to Paris to serve as an
                            assistant on several of the sub-commissions of the Inter-Allied
                            Commission on Aeronautics should be given the usual allowance for
                            subsistence of 40 francs per day. The Commissioners agreed that it would
                            be unwise to give Lt. Commander Callan the allowance in question since
                            the establishing of such a procedure would necessitate the approving of
                            a similar subsistence allowance to a considerable number of army or navy
                            officers at present stationed in Paris, who were doing work not directly

                            appointed to represent the United States on a committee dealing with

                            information only, but that they did object to his taking a chemical
                            expert with him. They likewise were not quite clear as to why Mr. Wolfe
                            required a military escort to go with him, or what facilities he
                            required from the Commission in order to enable him to procure the
                            desired information. The Commissioners therefore requested further data

                            plenty of available space for Major Rigby in Paris, and that it would be
                            unfair to those persons connected with the Mission who had not been
                            given rooms in the Crillon to allow Major Rigby, who had no connection
                            with the Commission to occupy such rooms. They likewise requested that

                            Benson on behalf of the Commission to confer with Minister Vesnich
                            regarding this matter, and to make such suggestions to the latter as he
                            might consider appropriate. <seg type="margin">Regarding Serbian General

                        <item>Two memoranda dated April 21st and 22nd 1919, prepared by Dr. Lord
                            were read to the Commissioners. These memoranda dealt with certain
                            Polish Ukrainian negotiations which had been carried on by Captains
                            Reisler and Bachman, and about the status of Col. Riggs’ Mission in
                            general. The Commissioners agreed with Dr. Lord in disapproving of the
                            action taken by Captains Reisler and Bachman, and likewise agreed with
                            Dr. Lord’s recommendations that Captain Reisler receive orders not to
                            return to Galicia, but either to remain in Paris or to go by the most
                            direct route to join Col. Riggs; and that a telegram be sent to Captain
                            Bachman ordering him to return to Paris. They likewise agreed that Col.
                            Riggs’ Mission, though hampered by the Allied evacuation of Odessa,
                            should not be withdrawn. <seg type="margin">Regarding Col. Riggs’

                    <p>1. Mr. White stated that in Mr. Lansing’s absence he had informed the Council
                        of Five of Mr. Lansing’s conversation with Mr. Paderewski and Mr. Benes, and
                        had conveyed to the Council the suggestion that these two gentlemen should
                        be given an opportunity to come to some decision among themselves on the
                        Teschen question. Mr. White added that Mr. Balfour had warmly supported this
                        suggestion, which had been accepted by the Council. <seg type="margin"
                            >Regarding the Teschen Question</seg></p>
                    <p>Mr. White stated that Mr. Paderewski had dined with him the night before, and
                        had stated that Poland was looking to the United States for a financial
                        advisor. Mr. White added that he had informed Mr. Paderewski that he was
                        anxious at the number of French Generals which the Polish Government was
                        bringing into Poland.</p>
                    <p>2. Discussing the threat of the Italians to leave the Conference, Mr. White
                        stated that he had been informed that Mr. Salandra did not intend to leave.
                        Mr. White stated that he had learned that Mr. Balfour was preparing a
                        statement for Mr. Lloyd George, which, after a few kind words for the
                        Italians, would support the American position. Mr. White added that he
                        understood that M. Clemenceau and Mr. Lloyd George had both approved of the
                        President’s statement regarding Italian claims. Mr. Lansing confirmed this,
                        and agreed with Mr. White that it would be well to give an intimation of
                        this nature to the Press. <seg type="margin">Regarding Italy Leaving the

                    <p>3. The telegram from the Department of State of April 22nd regarding
                        Ambassador Page’s leave of absence was read. Mr. Lansing and Mr. White
                        agreed that it would be unfortunate for Ambassador Page to be absent from
                        Rome at the present moment, and desired that a telegram in that sense be
                        sent to the Department of State. <seg type="margin">Leave of Absence for

                    <p>4. Mr. Grew’s inquiry regarding Mr. Wolfe’s visit to the German Chemical
                        Works was read. Mr. Lansing stated that he had discussed the matter fully
                        with Mr. Auchincloss, and suggested that Mr. Grew discuss the matter with
                        the latter. Mr. Lansing added that he approved of Mr. Wolfe’s contemplated
                        trip and of the arrangements which Mr. Auchincloss had indicated to him for
                        this trip. <seg type="margin">Mr. Wolfe’s Visit to the German Chemical
                            Works</seg></p>
                    <p>5. The recommendation of Dr. John R. Mott and Dr. Charles R. Watson regarding
                        measures to protect the interests, properties and activities of various
                        missionary and educational societies of the United States and Canada was
                        carefully considered. The formulas embodying the recommendations of these
                        gentlemen were in general approved, and it was desired that Mr. Grew consult
                        with Dr. Scott as to the manner in which they could best be dealt with, with
                        a <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0200"/>view to their possible
                        incorporation into the Peace Treaties which were being drafted. <seg

                            of Various Missionary and Educational Societies</seg></p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing suggested that in addition to the provisions for the protection
                        of missionary enterprises, it might be well to include a clause providing
                        that none of the religious or eleemosynary institutions concerned should in
                        any way interfere with the political life of the territory in which they
                        were situated. Mr. Lansing added that he had discussed this whole question
                        with Dr. Mott who had informed him that the guarantees were intended to
                        apply to all religious enterprises—Jews, Moslems etc., as well as
                        Christians. Mr. Lansing and Mr. White thought that it might be well to
                        broaden the scope of the clauses prepared by Dr. Mott and Dr. Watson so as
                        to include such countries as Roumania, Poland etc.</p>
                    <p>6. With reference to the memorandum regarding the supplying of clothing to
                        the military forces of Southern Russia, the Commissioners desire that the
                        matter be referred directly to General Bliss, who was dealing with matters
                        of this nature. Both Mr. Lansing and Mr. White were inclined to question the
                        right of the United States to make the sale in question. <seg type="margin"
                            >Supplies for Southern Russia</seg></p>
                    <p>7. Memorandum No. 240 regarding the use of small Austrian vessels in the
                        Adriatic by the Italian Government was discussed, and it was decided that in
                        view of the technical nature of the question involved it should be referred
                        to Mr. J. F. Dulles, Chairman of the Commission recently established to
                        decide on the disposition of Austro-Hungarian vessels in the Adriatic. It
                        was further suggested that Mr. Dulles discuss the matter with General Bliss
                        as the question raised by Admiral Benson’s letter involved an interpretation
                        of the terms of the armistice with Austria-Hungary. <seg type="margin">Use
                            of Small Austrian Vessels in Adriatic by the Italians</seg></p>
                    <p>8. Mr. Lansing and Mr. White desired that the memorandum from Dr. Lord and
                        Mr. Morison containing recommendations for dealing with the situation in the
                        Baltic provinces be referred to each one of the Commissioners, in order that
                        each might have time for consideration of this problem which appeared to be
                        one that required a detailed consideration. <seg type="margin">Situation in
                            Baltic Provinces</seg></p>
                    <p>9. Mr. Lansing read and initialed Mr. Whitehouse’s telegram regarding the
                        so-called Shackleton concessions.</p>
                    <p>10. With reference to Prof. Lybyer’s letter regarding the proposed mission to
                        Turkey, Mr. Lansing and Mr. White requested that a letter should be
                        addressed to the Commission from the two representatives appointed by the
                        President, namely, Mr. Crane and Dr. King and not by a possible member of
                        their party. It was desired that Mr. Crane and Dr. King should themselves
                        take the responsibility for the persons whom they might desire to take with
                        them. <seg type="margin">Mission to Turkey</seg></p>

                        <item>Memorandum No. 244 was read with regard to the Department of State
                            acting as an intermediary for messages between the Archangel Government
                            and the Omsk Government. The Commissioners felt that merely because of
                            the fact that State Department had at the request of Ambassador Francis
                            sent a message from the Archangel Government to the Omsk authorities
                            some time ago, there was no reason why it should continue doing this.
                            They therefore requested that the State Department be informed that they
                            were still of the opinion expressed in their telegram of April 18, 1919,
                            and that they still believe that it would be unwise for the State
                            Department to act on behalf of either of the Governments in question as
                            suggested. <seg type="margin">Communication Between Archangel &amp; Omsk

                        <item>A memorandum was read in which Prof. Westermann submitted certain
                            general clauses in regard to Mandates which he believed should be
                            embodied in the Treaty of Peace, and in which he suggested that an
                            American Commission be formed to consider this whole question. The
                            Commissioners themselves approved both of Prof. Westermann’s
                            suggestions, but requested that owing to the importance of this matter,
                            a letter be written to the President telling him that in the opinion of
                            the Commissioners, the whole question of Mandates required extremely
                            careful consideration, and requesting his opinion as to whether an
                            American Commission should not immediately be formed to consider this
                            matter, and that if possible, this Commission be broadened as soon as
                            possible into an Inter-Allied Commission for the same purpose. <seg

                            Reconstruction respecting the visits made by the French and British
                            Commissions to German Chemical Works in the zone of occupation should be
                            handed to Mr. Bradley Palmer for the information of the Alien Property
                            Custodian, and to Mr. Wigglesworth for the Department of Commerce. The
                            Commissioners agreed that the Alien Property Custodian and the
                            Department of Commerce should certainly be allowed to receive any

                            be admitted. This list should be checked up at the Quai d’Orsay in order

                        from Mr. Williams. Mr. Lansing suggested that General Bliss send to the

                    <p>Mr. White referred to a conversation which he had had with Mr. Balfour, in

                        had received the impression that the Council of Four desired him to discuss
                        the question with the Japanese representatives, whereas it appeared that it
                        was Mr. Lansing who had taken up the matter. Mr. Balfour added that he was
                        in a sense the victim of the method of procedure of the Council of Four.</p>
                    <p>2. General Bliss read excerpts from an alleged secret Treaty between Japan,

                        consideration by the Plenary Session of the question of responsibilities was
                        that General Botha objected to the report as submitted. The Commissioners
                        remarked on the apparent discomfiture of the French and British at the

                        B. Noyes of the “Rhineland Commission”. It was desired that Mr. Grew write

                        $10,000 to Mr. Noyes for his Mission which was only to last until the
                        signature of Peace. Before passing upon this request, they desired a more
                        detailed statement of the reasons for such a large appropriation for such a
                        small Mission. <seg type="margin">Personnel and Equipment Rhineland

                    <p>8. With reference to Memorandum No. 254 regarding the Inter-Allied Commission
                        on Mandates in Turkey. Mr. Lansing and Mr. White agreed in the propriety of
                        offering Mr. King a salary at the rate of $8,000 per year for the period
                        during which he might serve as head of this Mission. With regard to the
                        sending of an American ship to take the Inter-Allied Commission: It was
                        desired that Mr. Grew inquire of Admiral Benson whether such a ship could be
                        assigned, and the conditions under which the assignment might be made,
                        before finally passing upon this question. As regards funds to defray the
                        expenses of the Commission to Turkey, Mr. Lansing was of the opinion that it
                        would be impossible to judge what amount might be necessary. Mr. White
                        approved a suggestion that $10,000 should be appropriated to start the
                        Commission, with the understanding that a further appropriation might be
                        granted in case the first grant proved insufficient. <seg type="margin"

                    <p>9. With reference to Memorandum No. 251 regarding the sending of an American
                        Commissioner to Constantinople to act in Mr. Heck’s absence, Mr. White
                        stated that he had talked the matter over with Mr. Heck, who was of the
                        opinion that Admiral Bristol was both competent to perform the duties of
                        American Commissioner, and would also be pleased at receiving the
                        opportunity to act in this capacity. It was suggested therefore that Mr.
                        Grew write to Admiral Benson inquiring from him whether it would be possible
                        for Admiral Bristol to take over temporarily the duties which Mr. Heck had
                        been performing, and send reports to the Commission and to the Department of
                        State in regard to political matters affecting Constantinople. <seg

                    <p>Mr. Heck entered the meeting and stated that as long as Dr. Montgomery was
                        proceeding to Turkey with the King-Crane Mission it would not be necessary
                        to give him a special appointment.</p>
                    <p>10. Memorandum No. 255 quoting a telegram from Mr. Dresel regarding the
                        German attitude towards his Mission was read. Mr. Lansing was of the opinion
                        that no action was necessary on this telegram. <seg type="margin">Statement

                            messages which had been received from the American Ambassador at Rome.
                            They therefore requested that a letter be drafted to Mr. Page, conveying

                            Governments. The Commissioners felt that inasmuch as this was a very
                            delicate subject, and that the communication of such a message to the
                            British Delegation at least, would undoubtedly elicit <pb n="172"

                            of the competent representative of the Jugo-Slavs in Paris with a

                            T. Shotwell to attend the meetings of the Organization Commission
                            “Commission for International Labor Legislation” in London on May 6th.
                            The Commissioners agreed that it would be well to have the United States
                            represented by Mr. Shotwell, but felt that no credentials could be given
                            him by the Government because of the fact that the report of the Labor
                            Commission which provided for the Organization Commission had not yet
                            been ratified by the Senate. It was therefore decided that Mr. Shotwell
                            should merely be given credentials from the Mission indicating that he
                            was entitled to represent the United States in a provisory capacity
                            pending the possible ratification of the labor report at a future date.

                            that it would be well to have Admiral Bristol designated as Chief
                            Political Officer of the United States in Constantinople temporarily,
                            and that Admiral Benson be requested to send the necessary instructions

                            both for his own guidance, and in order, if possible, to offset the

                            Commission. The Commissioners felt that if this was not the case no

                            it would be unfair to many other naval and military officers who have

                            as well as the draft of a letter to General Langfitt, regarding the

                            Committee of the Peace Conference. The Commissioners knew absolutely
                            nothing about this Committee, nor about Prof. Jefferson’s appointment or
                            assignment to it. They therefore request that they be given a copy of
                            Prof. Jefferson’s credentials appointing him to this Committee, as well
                            as a short statement of the work already performed by it. Mr. Lansing is
                            particularly anxious for this information because Prof. Jefferson is a
                            State Department employee and appears to have been conducting business
                            on the Committee in question without Mr. Lansing’s knowledge.<note

                            room available for them on such transports. They agreed, however, that

                            The Commissioners felt that they were not in a position to furnish Mr.

                            having either Mr. Poole or Col. Riggs in Paris it was decided to
                            postpone a decision. In this instance, however, the Commissioners felt
                            that inasmuch as Col. Riggs required an immediate decision in order to
                            get the necessary orders it would be well to have him remain in Paris
                            until the end of the Conference or until such time it was found that his
                            services were no longer needed with the Commission. It is, therefore,
                            requested that the necessary steps be taken in order to delay Col.
                            Riggs’ trip to Archangel. <seg type="margin">Retention of Col. Riggs in

                            beginning June 1st, 1919, it would only be fair for the Commission to
                            guarantee her salary at the present rate until July 1st, 1919, even

                            these gentlemen at the disposal of the Commission in connection with the
                            important questions still to be decided. They, therefore, expressed the
                            hope that satisfactory arrangements could be made with those gentlemen
                            in order to induce them to remain with the Commission. The Commissioners
                            took no action in regard to the application of Dr. Magie because they
                            were not aware of the functions which he had been performing with the
                            Commission and desired further information in respect to his duties. Dr.
                            Morison’s application for permission to sail on July 11th was approved.

                        <item>Memorandum No. 285 was read in which a Mr. Lapina requested permission

                            Peace Conference. The Commissioners felt that if this album was to be
                            prepared for charitable purposes it would be very simple for Mr. Lapina
                            to obtain photographs taken previously of them, but if it was a private
                            undertaking they would not care to be photographed again. They likewise
                            stated that in no case would it be possible for Mr. Lapina to photograph
                            them all together. <seg type="margin">Photograph of

                    <p>1. Mr. Herter read a memorandum prepared by Dr. Mezes for Mr. Grew,
                        summarizing briefly the most important points which would still have to be
                        acted upon by the Commissioners alter the actual treaties of peace had been
                        signed with Germany and Austria. The Commissioners requested that they be
                        given copies of this memorandum. <seg type="margin">Points To Be Acted Upon

                    <p>2. At the request of the Commissioners, Col. Sherman Miles entered the
                        meeting in order to discuss with the Commissioners certain phases of the
                        Montenegrin and Albanian situation. Col. Miles, who had just returned from
                        Montenegro, gave a short statement as to the conditions in Montenegro at the
                        present moment as he had observed them together with a brief outline of the
                        events leading to the present state of affairs. When asked what solution he
                        advocated in regard to the Montenegrin situation, Col. Miles stated that he
                        felt the only possible solution was a union of Montenegro with Jugo-Slavia,
                        provided it were guaranteed a measure of autonomy similar in relation to its
                        population as had been granted to the Croats and Slovenes. Col. Miles also
                        felt that the boundaries between Albania and Montenegro should be redrawn
                        along clearly defined nationalistic lines without regard to the special
                        interests of any outside influences and without regard to the recent actions
                        of the Serbians which had caused the evacuation of certain southern
                        districts of Montenegro by the Albanians. <seg type="margin">Reports of Col.

                    <p>In regard to Albania, Col. Miles sketched briefly her tribal form of
                        government and the great difficulties of her being able to maintain order
                        within her own boundaries unless given the protection or assistance of some
                        outside great power. He felt that Albania should be an independent state,
                        but that it should be under the mandate of either England or the United
                        States.</p>

                    <p>1. Mr. Herter read a letter in regard to the appointment of Mr. Magie to the
                        Commission and called attention to the fact that they had approved of Mr.
                        Magie’s appointment during the month of January. In view of the above the
                        Commissioners approved of Mr. Magie’s return to the United States provided
                        Dr. Westermann felt that he no longer had any use for him with the
                        Commission. <seg type="margin">Release of Mr. Magie From Duty With

                    <p>2. Memorandum No. 286 was read in which Dr. Mezes had submitted the requests
                        of Dr. Seymour, Dr. Jefferson, Dr. Day and Mr. Stratton <pb n="186"
                            xml:id="pg_186" facs="0222"/>to be relieved from the Commission during
                        the first week of June. The Commissioners did not approve of having Drs.
                        Seymour, Jefferson and Day relieved at that time, feeling that their
                        services were still essential to the work of the Commission. In regard to
                        Mr. Stratton they felt that the question should remain at the discretion of
                        Dr. Jefferson. <seg type="margin">Requests of Drs. Seymour, Jefferson &amp;

                    <p>The Commissioners likewise noted the statements of Dr. Seymour and Mr. Day to
                        the effect that they were unable to continue investigations or further
                        studies in their particular fields because of the lack of maps and books,
                        which had been packed up for shipment to the United States. They felt there
                        was no occasion to hamper the work of the gentlemen by having the books and
                        maps in question packed away and, therefore, requested that an explicit
                        order be given immediately directing that all such documents, books or maps
                        belonging to the Commission as might in any way be useful to any member of
                        the Commission in pursuing investigations or studies for the Commission
                        should be immediately unpacked and left at the disposal of those individuals
                        who might wish to use them.</p>
                    <p>3. The Commissioners considered and approved memorandums Nos. 287 and 288
                        regarding the release from the Commission of Capt. C. N. Peacock and Army
                        Field Clerk Maynard Mashburn. <seg type="margin">Release of Capt. Peacock

                    <p>4. Mr. Herter read a memorandum regarding inquiries made about the disposal
                        of maps, drawing material, etc., to the American Relief Association [<hi
                            rend="italic">Administration?</hi>], now in the possession of the
                        Intelligence Section of the Commission. No decision was reached by the
                        Commissioners. They desired information as to whether any of the material
                        which might be turned over to the American Relief Association [<hi
                            rend="italic">Administration?</hi>] could not possibly be of use to the
                        Department of State. They felt that only such things should be disposed of
                        by the Commission as were duplicates or were absolutely of no use to the
                        State Department. <seg type="margin">Disposal of Maps, Drawing Material,
                            etc. to American Relief Assn.</seg></p>
                    <p>5. Memorandum No. 289 was considered in regard to the return to the United
                        States of Drs. Westermann and Lunt. The Commissioners agreed that these two
                        gentlemen should be reimbursed the sums which they had had to deposit in
                        order to reserve transportation to the United States on June 7th and should
                        immediately upon the completion of their duties with the Commission be
                        granted transportation either on a commercial liner or on a transport. The
                        Commissioners felt that they were unable to state as to the probable date
                        for the release of these gentlemen from the Commission, but felt certain
                        that this release would <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0223"/>come as
                        soon as possible and when such release would not injure the efficiency of

                    <p>6. Mr. Herter offered to read the list of personnel released by the
                        Commission since April 1st, but the Commissioners upon being assured that
                        the list contained no names with which they were not already familiar
                        requested that the list be merely kept on record and up to date so that they
                        might be able to consult it whenever necessary. <seg type="margin">List of

                    <p>7. Prof. Coolidge entered the meeting at this time at the request of the
                        Commissioners. <seg type="margin">Report of Professor Coolidge</seg></p>
                    <p>Prof. Coolidge, who had just returned from Austria where he had served
                        several months at the head of the American Political Mission, briefly
                        described to the Commissioners his impressions of both the Austrian and
                        Hungarian situations. His impression of the Austrian situation was that it
                        was temporarily as good as could be expected, but that as a permanent
                        situation it would be extremely bad. The government had printed a great deal
                        of paper money with which it was relieving unemployment and doing its best
                        to make the best of a very bad economical situation. Only with coal did he
                        feel that the unemployment situation could be relieved.</p>
                    <p>Prof. Coolidge suggested that in considering the boundary between Austria and
                        Hungary the Commission should certainly take into account the claims of the
                        Austrians for a small portion of West Hungary which is the so-called Kitchen
                        Garden of Vienna. This section, geographically and economically forms a part
                        of the Austrian State, and also the population is very largely German and
                        desires to be joined to Germany.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the present government Prof. Coolidge felt it was as good as
                        could be expected under the circumstances and that if it were replaced by
                        another government, that government would undoubtedly be inferior to it. He
                        likewise felt that there was very little chance of a revolution at the
                        present moment and that its government was a proper one for the Allied and
                        Associated governments to make peace with. Bauer, the Minister of Public
                        Affairs, he characterized as clever and strong, whereas Renner, the Austrian
                        Plenipotentiary in Paris was clever but weak.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the Hungarian situation, Prof. Coolidge stated that he agreed
                        along broad lines with the conclusions reached by Professor Brown. The
                        present government was largely de-centralized and remains stable only at
                        such times as it did not fear interference from the outside. Each time that
                        an aggressive movement was begun against it Bela Kuhn is always ready to
                        negotiate and weaken. Terrorism and outrages are undoubtedly increasing and
                        Bolsheviki are counterfeiting money in tremendous quantities and sending it
                        out in their <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0224"/>pouches to Vienna and
                        elsewhere for propaganda purposes. This counterfeiting extends to French and
                        English as well as to Hungarian and Russian money.</p>
                    <p>Professor Coolidge felt that the only solution of the problem was to induce
                        the French to send troops into Buda Pest to clean it out and set up a new
                        government. Only in this way could the Danube be opened and normal
                        economical and commercial activities be restored to the whole of South
                        Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the foregoing Professor Coolidge described briefly the
                        feelings of the Austrians towards the Jugo-Slavs, the Hungarians, the
                        Bohemians and the proposed cession of a portion of the Tyrol to Italy. In
                        regard to the Jugo-Slavs he stated that the Austrians entertained a certain
                        amount of respect for the Serbians and were antagonistic only to Slovenes,
                        with whom they were disputing the Carinthian boundary. With the Hungarians
                        they were afraid to come to any open break because of the necessity of their
                        pulling together, although they felt quite strongly about that small portion
                        of West Hungary which they desired to have joined to German-Austria. The
                        Bohemians they were very bitter against, partly because of the coal question
                        and partly because of the uncompromising attitude which they had adopted
                        towards their fellow members of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. In regard to
                        the section of Tyrol which is to be given to Italy, they are extremely
                        bitter, in fact the feeling in this respect extended far beyond the
                        importance of the actual cession which they are required to make. It seemed
                        incredible to them that the people of Andreas Hofer should be delivered to a
                        foreign rule.</p>

                        Vorarlberg which resulted in 80 per cent of the population desiring to be
                        united with Switzerland.</p>

                            considered in connection with Memorandum No. 267 regarding increases to
                            other members of Mr. Crane’s and Dr. King’s Mission. The Commissioners
                            felt that they would be unable to approve of the increases suggested on
                            behalf of Sgt. Major Toren and Pvt. Lambing, but suggested that any
                            extra expenses that might have to be borne by these two men in
                            connection with personal outfit, etc., for their trip should be
                            considered by the Commission as necessary expenses of the Mission to be
                            covered by the $10,000.00 appropriation previously granted. <seg

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: Gentlemen, we have come together in
                        order that we may hear from you on the question of the German
                        counter-proposals. We all have moving recollections of the struggles through
                        which we have gone in framing the treaty, and the efforts we made that were
                        successful, and the efforts we made that were unsuccessful to make the terms
                        different from what they are, and I have come here not to express an opinion
                        but to hear opinions, and I think perhaps the best course to follow will be
                        to get a general impression from each other as to which parts of the German
                        counter arguments have made the greatest impression upon us.</p>
                    <p>Just as a guide, I find that the parts that have made the greatest impression
                        on our British colleagues are the arguments with regard to the eastern
                        frontier with Poland, the parts with regard to reparations, the parts about
                        the period of occupation, together with the point about the League of
                        Nations, their impression being that the Germans might very well be given
                        reasonably to expect that the period of their probation would not be long in
                        the matter of admission into the League. Those are the four points, the four
                        subjects upon which the German counter-proposals have made the deepest
                        impressions upon them. That might be the start.</p>
                    <p>The reparation is the biggest point. That involves left-overs of the
                        financial clauses. I would be glad to hear from anyone of our financial
                        group who would like to express himself on that point.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Norman H. Davis</hi>: We feel that the Germans have
                        really given us a basis for getting together properly on reparation, by
                        coming back with a fixed sum. It is a rather rigid fixed sum, which can be
                        modified and made more workable. There is a considerable possibility of
                        getting together there, if we can get the French to agree upon a fixed sum.
                        As you know, we have always insisted on the necessity of having a fixed sum,
                        because by leaving it indefinite we had to give considerable powers to the
                        Reparations Commission, and that is what seems to worry the Germans more
                        than anything else—the powers given to the Reparations Commission, which, as
                        they claim, are rather destructive than constructive, and if we come back
                        and make a fixed amount, it will be possible to do away with the functions
                        of the Reparations Commission which most worry the Germans, and it will
                        avoid the necessity of interfering with their internal affairs, and so
                        on.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel House</hi>: Have not the Germans misconstrued
                        what the treaty says on that point? That it really does not go as far as the
                        Germans think it goes, and if the matter were explained to them personally,
                            <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0235"/>that they would understand it
                        differently from what they now understand it?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Thomas W. Lamont</hi>: I believe that they could be
                        made to understand that, Colonel House. Certainly the intent of the
                        Reparations Commission is nothing like as inquisitorial nor as arbitrary as
                        the Germans have construed it to be, and I believe that we could explain
                        that to a very large extent, provided, as Mr. Davis says, there was coupled
                        with it the change from an indefinite, vague sum to be determined two years
                        from now, to a definite sum to be determined today, because that very change
                        would do away with a large part of the necessity of such a commission.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: May I ask if you saw Messrs. Tardieu
                        and Loucheur this morning?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Lamont</hi>: We saw Mr. Tardieu. Mr. Loucheur did
                        not come.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: What was his statement?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Lamont</hi>: Mr. Tardieu’s first reply was that they
                        could consider no change, because Mr. Lloyd George had brought up so many
                        changes. He alluded to the conference at the President’s house yesterday
                        afternoon. But during the last part of the conference he finally came around
                        and said that if it were a question of reparation alone and not a question
                        of the Army of Occupation and these other things, he did not know but that
                        they could devise with us the machinery that could work out the idea of a
                        fixed sum, provided the sum were adequate enough. He alluded to the first
                        answer, Mr. President, that you made to the first German note, in which you
                        indicated that execution might be changed somewhat, or made to conform, and
                        he said that if we could work reparation under the head of execution rather
                        than change of principle, “I believe we could be with you”.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: May I ask that what I say by way of
                        reference to our British colleagues be not repeated outside of this room,
                        because I am at liberty to use it only for the purposes of this conference.
                        But here are the alternative methods of reparation which were suggested:
                        first, that the Germans should undertake as a contract the whole task of
                        restoration, that is to say, the physical restoration of the ravaged parts
                        of northern France, and that a sum should be fixed in the treaty of peace,
                        under several items in the category of damages, the principle being that
                        inasmuch as it was impossible now to estimate what the actual restoration
                        would cost, that they should be put under contract to restore northern
                        France within a definite period, and that, since the rest of the categories
                        would perhaps hold them, a definite sum ought to be arrived at in regard to
                        that.</p>
                    <p>The alternative plan was—and it is a rather vague one—that the Germans should
                        sign the reparation clauses as they stand, but that three months should be
                        given them to effect an arrangement for fixing <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200"
                            facs="0236"/>a definite sum in cash as a compensation of all claims.
                        That the reparation clauses were to stand, giving them three years for
                        proposals as to the definite sum.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Baruch</hi>: We discussed those two alternatives
                        that you speak of, Mr. President, yesterday, but we still feel that the best
                        solution would be to come to a fixed sum now, to start with. We went over
                        this yesterday.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: And reject the idea of a contract
                        for restoration?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: It would be difficult, as a matter of
                        practice, to carry that out.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Summers</hi>: There is an economic unsoundness in
                        it, because many of the districts and places that were devastated and
                        destroyed were located many years ago, and have now no economic basis for
                        being there. For instance, they could combine into one steel mill several
                        destroyed mills. Many of the existing mills could be combined into one; one
                        could be substituted for many. Unless there was a latitude given, it would
                        be economically unsound.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Lamont</hi>: Mr. President, with all respect to Mr.
                        Lloyd George, he is simply trying to postpone the evil day, as far as public
                        opinion is concerned.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: I think he has stated the way it is
                        to be gone about.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Lamont</hi>: Still, whichever way one looks at it,
                        from the Allied point of view or from the German point of view, it is better
                        to make it definite. Germany cannot start her economic and industrial life,
                        cannot gain any credit, as long as it remains open.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: He is trying to play both ways
                        undoubtedly there, and as a matter of practice, it is very hard to work that
                        out, because we can never get together as to the distribution of this fixed
                        amount, because they would have to calculate all the time what would be
                        France’s share in the restoration of the Germans.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel House</hi>: It would be something like
                        re-writing the treaty.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: We are convinced, Mr. President, that on
                        account of Europe’s financial situation today it is a most important thing
                        to fix an amount, and an amount which Germany and the world itself have some
                        hope of her being able to pay, and carrying out, which can be used as a
                        basis for France and Italy and the other countries getting on their feet and
                        meeting their requirements.</p>
                    <p>Under the present arrangements, as the Germans very properly state, if they
                        are not prosperous and cannot get back to work they will pay nothing, but on
                        the other hand, if they buckle down to work and work hard and save, the
                        harder they work and the more they save, the more they will pay. And that is
                        a rather poor incentive for the Germans to buckle down and work hard. But if
                        there is a fixed amount which will let them see a chance of getting from
                        under some day, I believe that would be a better incentive for them.</p>
                    <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0237"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: How about the other side of it: a
                        fixed sum will form a basis of credit for the other nations, but what will
                        form a basis for Germany’s credit?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel House</hi>: It was practically a fixed sum.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: Yes, there would be that
                        definiteness in it, but where would her assets be?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: We must insist upon her being left with
                        sufficient assets as a working capital.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: As a matter of fact the Reparations
                        Commission can do that.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: They are permitted to leave her with
                        certain assets, except the ships. We feel that some arrangement certainly
                        must be made whereby Germany can at least have a sufficient number of those
                        ships, either retaining them or making some arrangement for getting them
                        back, so that she will have enough for her own trade, and which I understand
                        amounts to about one-third of the ships which she has turned over.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Now Germany offers a fixed sum,
                        does she?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: It is 100 milliards of
                        marks?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: Yes. Of course they make quite a large
                        amount of deductions. They say that they will pay the first sum of 20
                        milliards of marks in the first seven years, but that you must deduct from
                        that the war materials they have turned over and everything else they have
                        turned over and will turn over under the treaty, and also the proportionate
                        share of the pre-war and the war debt of Alsace-Lorraine and of that part of
                        the territory that Poland gets, which they estimate roughly would amount to
                        about three million dollars. (?)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Lamont</hi>: Still, Mr. Secretary, it is very
                        striking that they have made two definite offers: the offer of 20 milliards,
                        and the further offer to devote to reparations a sum annually amounting
                        approximately to the total net peace budget of the German Empire, between
                        $750,000,000 and one billion dollars.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: As I recall it, they offer to
                        pay 20 milliards of marks on or before May 1st, 1926, and then they offer to
                        pay one milliard a year after that. But they will increase it, on the basis
                        that their people shall not be taxed more than the greatest amount paid by
                        any injured country.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: They say that as a result they will be
                        compelled, according to that, to tax that heavily; but at least 20 milliards
                        they offer to pay within seven years, and without interest. That is not a
                        capital sum. If you reduce that to a capital sum that will amount to 12½ or
                        15 milliards. We feel, from a practical standpoint, that it is better to
                        have it interest bearing. Of course you have to give them a few <pb n="202"
                            xml:id="pg_202" facs="0238"/>years before they can afford to pay
                        interest, because otherwise it would run so fast against them that they
                        could not catch up.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: It does not come so very far
                        from the 15 billions of dollars talked about.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Lamont</hi>: It is a little bit less. After you take
                        away deductions it would amount to the capital sum of 10 billion
                        dollars.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: Do you understand that the French
                        this morning were not willing to consider an alteration or change of that
                        sort?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Lamont</hi>: I think they are willing to consider a
                        change of that sort if some one will tell them that that is the only change
                        that could be discussed. At least that was Mr. Tardieu’s attitude. Mr.
                        McCormick could better tell us that.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Vance McCormick</hi>: He said that every
                        modification proposed by the British was against the French. The British
                        never mentioned any concession regarding ships or the colonies, and Mr.
                        Tardieu called Mr. Lloyd George’s attention to that fact. Mr. Tardieu’s
                        position was that they should not agree to a change in the present treaty;
                        that during these five months the experts have discussed these questions pro
                        and con, and having finally come to a decision, it would be fatal to change
                        any principle whatever. The question of machinery of execution, as you
                        stated in your note, might be considered; that was the position the French
                        took. And as he went out of the room he intimated to Mr. Lamont that he
                        might consider such questions as the question of the reparation clauses,
                        along the line we have just been discussing, provided it was not opening the
                        door to concessions along the other lines. France could not afford to
                        concede anything further.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: Would he regard fixing a capital sum
                        as a modification of principle, or a method?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. McCormick</hi>: A method. Didn’t you gather that?
                        (Addressing Mr. Lamont.)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Lamont</hi>: Yes. Mr. Loucheur, of course, has more
                        to say about that than Mr. Tardieu has. If it had not been for the British
                        “Heavenly Twins” we could have gotten together with Loucheur months ago.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: Now he is a little bit worried about
                        that political aspect of it, but if there are some changes made which would
                        affect the British I think it would have a certain influence on the French,
                        but, as Tardieu says, the only changes that are proposed are practically
                        those that affect the French.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel House</hi>: Premier Clemenceau told me last
                        night that he was willing to discuss Silesia. He was not willing to discuss
                        the period of occupation, and he was not willing to discuss any of the other
                        things that Lloyd George wanted.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: Did he say that he would not discuss
                        reparation?</p>
                    <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0239"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel House</hi>: No, and I gathered that he would. I
                        think we could get him to discuss reparation. And I also think—much to my
                        surprise—that he would about the League of Nations. He said he would not
                        consider for a moment letting the Germans in now, and I said: “Well, your
                        attitude about that I think is the worst attitude for France, and I cannot
                        understand it. It seems to me that you can see that the sooner the League of
                        Nations gets its grip on Germany the better it would be for France.” He
                        said: “I concede that; that is all right; but not for the moment.
                        Presently.” So I don’t think he is going to be very bad on that. I think the
                        Germans could be told privately that Germany will come in very shortly. I
                        think we could get him to consent to that.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: Well, if you gentlemen of the
                        reparation group had a free hand—if only we ourselves were concerned—what
                        would you propose with regard to the reparation?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: Well, we have not definitely agreed
                        among ourselves as to just what we would propose, but we certainly are in
                        accord with this, that we would propose and insist upon a fixed sum, and
                        that that fixed sum would be as high as we really could get Germany to agree
                        to without having a bayonet at her throat, because, after all, the important
                        thing, as stated before, is to get something which can be used as a basis
                        for France and Italy to get more credit, and which will not be so burdensome
                        as will prevent Germany from going ahead with restoring her industrial life,
                        because, after all, what they need to do more than anything is to get people
                        to work, and they have pretty nearly all exhausted their credit. Loucheur is
                        worried about that now, and the important thing is not so much what Germany
                        can pay now, really just now, as fixing a reasonable amount which the German
                        people are willing to buckle down to attempting to pay, and which the
                        investors of the world think she will pay,—and they are rather apt to
                        believe that Germany will pay what she undertakes to pay.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: The aspect of the subject which
                        interests me is the world aspect of it. Unless these securities that Germany
                        is going to give are known to be worth something they cannot be used as a
                        basis for credit, and somebody else will have to supply the credit. Now they
                        cannot be made worth anything unless Germany has the means of going to work
                        and producing. Which is the result of saying that they cannot be made worth
                        anything unless she has assets to begin with to establish her own credit.
                        And therefore the thing has two sides to it; not only the aspect of Germany
                        and France and Italy—but the world aspect; working out a method by which
                        this sum would be made not only definite but worth something, by having
                        means for Germany to get to work.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: Yes, we think so.</p>
                    <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0240"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: Now it seems to me that we could
                        have made it evident to the Germans, by explaining to them, that the real
                        functions of the Reparations Commission, are, as I understand them to be, to
                        help them in carrying out their obligations. The only trouble is, that it is
                        one thing to say that this is the way the Reparations Commission is going to
                        work, and another thing to find it in the treaty. Because we, of the present
                        group of persons, are putting a certain interpretation on the treaty, but
                        there will be others following us who may not put the same interpretation
                        upon it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: We probably have not got in there as
                        clear a picture of what our idea was as to the policy that would be followed
                        by the Reparations Commission as we should have, and it would be well, and
                        it would undoubtedly affect the Germans, if they could be told.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: Why not write—I don’t know what the
                        language would be—an accompanying memorandum, agreed to by all the powers,
                        as to the method of administration by the Reparations Commission?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Baruch</hi>: Of course if we fixed a sum the
                        Reparations Commission would die. If we fixed a definite sum, and Germany
                        agreed to it, and she delivered, the Reparations Commission, as we have got
                        it set up, would die, and another would be set up to receive the funds and
                        bonds.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: The Reparations Commission was set up
                        principally because they were leaving this matter indefinite, and because we
                        were imposing a burden upon Germany concerning which there was some doubt as
                        to her capacity to meet. But as it was clearly understood that they must
                        follow a constructive policy, and that Germany could not pay anything unless
                        she was given facilities and working capital it was absolutely necessary to
                        set up this commission, with the idea of getting all they could out of
                        Germany, but doing this in a broad way. But that is not the picture that is
                        really conveyed in there, (i. e., in the Treaty). The powers of the
                        Reparations Commission are, in a sense, destructive as far as Germany is
                        concerned—they could be—but it ought to be explained to the Germans that no
                        intelligent people could perform its destructive powers unless Germany
                        wilfully failed to comply.</p>
                    <p>There is no limitation on what the Reparations Commission can do, and since
                        the armistice the agreements with the Germans have been outrageously
                        violated by the French, as for instance, the Luxembourg protocol,<note
                            n="93" xml:id="d79fn93">Reference is to the negotiations concerning the
                            economic terms of the Armistice, which took place at Luxembourg,
                            December 23–25, 1918.</note> etc., and the Germans have had an
                        experience of what the giving of this power has meant, and they complained
                        of it, to which I responded and asked them if they did not think they were
                        entitled to it. They have got evidence to show that the commissions have
                        thus far been outrageously unfair.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: You think that difficulty would be
                        met then by a fixed sum?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Summers</hi>: Unquestionably. We have always
                        rewarded, by pensions and in similar ways, deeds of heroism, and each nation
                        has chosen to reward its heroes as it saw fit, and to place that on the
                        Germans on the basis that the French have awarded theirs is unprecedented in
                        the history of the world. And if we had stood for actual reparation we might
                        get some place within a rational sum, which Germany could pay, and we would
                        have a basis for understanding upon that amount.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Lamont</hi>: Mr. President, I believe our
                        difficulties with Germany would fade away if you and Mr. Clemenceau and Mr.

                        definite sum within twenty-four hours instead of two years, and at the same
                        time to reach an agreement as to how much working capital should be left in
                        Germany’s hands.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: We instructed them once to find a

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: You remember they used to change
                        commissions such as this, in times gone by, every time they decided against
                        the wishes of the heads of the states.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel House</hi>: Do you remember how we always knew,
                        when the individual members would come in to a meeting, just what the trend

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: Now the joke of it is that Lord

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Lamont</hi>: I believe we could get together on this

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: Of course on those constructions you
                        should make the necessary consequential changes in the Reparations
                        Commission, and if possible do something to get away with it. I am afraid
                        you will have to have a reparations commission for a while.</p>
                    <p>But it is necessary to have a commission, really, to receive the funds and
                        the bonds, and open the trust for the proper distribution at the proper
                        time.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: Now what about the eastern borders
                        of Germany?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. R. H. Lord</hi>: I must confess that the general
                        tenor of the German argument about the cession to be made to Poland struck
                        me as a rather weak attempt to escape from the principle laid down in the
                        fourteen points with regard to the united Polish state, containing all
                        Polish territories, and a secure access to the sea.</p>
                    <p>The territories which the treaty proposes to give to Poland are so
                        indisputably Polish that in general the Germans have not been able to pick
                        very serious flaws in the treaty from the point of view of nationality,
                        statistics or the principle of uniting indisputably Polish territories to
                        Poland. They have gone out to find all, what they call, the <pb n="206"
                            xml:id="pg_206" facs="0242"/>purely German districts which are awarded
                        to Poland under this treaty, and what they have been able to find is very
                        little. They have been able to detect a small district here and another
                        small district there where there is a German majority. Sometimes they use
                        very bad figures in establishing that. But, at any rate, here and there they
                        have found places where, owing to necessities of topography or of railway
                        communications, or in order to secure a halfway compact frontier, the
                        proposal incorporated in the treaty had been to give slight areas of German
                        majority to Poland. There are a couple of such cases where it is possible
                        that rectifications in the line proposed by the treaty might be made without
                        serious consequences to the integrity of the whole solution. Here is one
                        case where there is a short bit of railway line (exhibiting on map), that
                        might be rectified.</p>
                    <p>But, as everyone knows, the linguistic border between Germans and Poles is an
                        extremely sinuous and contorted one. There has been an immense admixture of
                        the two races in this part of the world,—an admixture which has been largely
                        due to the systematic work of the Prussian government, with its colonization
                        methods, which has flooded certain portions with Germans by purely
                        artificial means, and kept the Germans there by purely artificial means.</p>
                    <p>Now it was impossible for the Commission on Polish Affairs in making the
                        proposals of the boundaries here, to avoid including in the frontiers of
                        Poland some—not large—regions of Germans. Otherwise no compact frontier
                        could have been reached. The Commission in its proposals left out a number
                        of regions that were on the other side, and it made quite consistent efforts
                        to be fair in its proposals. We can see only two places where slight changes
                        might be made without serious results, and even in one of them, because of
                        its character, I think a change would be quite questionable because it would
                        make dangerously narrow and insecure that access to the Baltic Sea which is,
                        I think, one of the cardinal and indispensable elements of the general
                        Polish settlement.</p>
                    <p>The point which the Germans lay most stress on, perhaps, is the question of
                        Upper Silesia, and perhaps that is a question on which it is better—</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel House</hi>: (Interrupting) They ask for a
                        plebiscite there, and following that plebiscite, what in your opinion would
                        be the result?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: My opinion is that it would result
                        favorably to Poland—I have very little doubt about that—if it could be
                        arranged under conditions that would ensure a fair expression of the popular
                        will.</p>
                    <p>I cannot forbear, however, laying before you the very great practical
                        difficulties in the way of that. I think everyone recognizes that a
                        plebiscite in German territory cannot be held while the territory is
                        occupied by German troops and by German officials. Just at present, in spite
                        of the republican government of Germany, they are having a <pb n="207"
                            xml:id="pg_207" facs="0243"/>veritable reign of terror in Upper Silesia
                        which is as bad as anything that went on under the Imperial Government, and
                        such a state exists there that they have been arresting every prominent
                        Polish leader; they have been placing people on trial charged with being
                        guilty of high treason for the crime of having made speeches in favor of
                        union with Poland, or collecting money in favor of Polish national
                        causes.</p>
                    <p>So, under present conditions it is impossible to have a fair plebiscite. You
                        would have to occupy the country with Allied troops, and I wonder whether
                        the Allied and Associated Governments are prepared to do that. Consequently,
                        even under those present conditions there is this difficulty about a
                        plebiscite.</p>
                    <p>Upper Silesia is a country where a very great part of the land and a great
                        part of the industries of the country are in the hands of a very small group
                        of great magnates. There is such a concentration of property in the hands of
                        a few great families as you find almost nowhere else in Germany. They are in
                        the hands of such families as the Hohenlohe, von Pless, and half a dozen
                        others. And then the great industries of the country are also controlled by
                        German capital. It means that the Polish population is economically, without
                        a doubt, in great dependence upon German land owners and capitalists, and as
                        the experience of every election that comes from that country shows, it is
                        extremely difficult for them to vote as they please without ruining their
                        chances of a livelihood. I can think of few countries where the countryman
                        finds it so dangerous to express his opinion at the polls.</p>
                    <p>As for the other general fact about the Upper Silesian situation, the part of
                        Upper Silesia which the treaty proposes to give to Poland has a ratio of
                        Polish majority of two to one, and in fact, decidedly more than that
                        according to the revision of the German statistics which the British experts
                        have prepared. It comes as near to being indisputably Polish territory as
                        any part of Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>The chief value of that territory to Germany, of course, lies in its immense
                        mineral wealth, which is undoubtedly the fact, as their response says that
                        Upper Silesia produces 23 percent of the total coal output of the German
                        Empire, and I think it is something like four-fifths of the production of
                        zinc, and a large part of the production of iron.</p>
                    <p>It is true that the loss of that territory might be a very serious economic
                        blow to Germany, but I would like to lay before you this other fact that if
                        Upper Silesia contains about one-quarter of Germany’s coal output, it
                        contains about three-quarters of the coal output of the territories of
                        Polish nationality, so the loss to Germany on the one hand, would also mean
                        that it would be a serious blow and a loss to Poland on the other.
                        Three-quarters of her coal would be a far more decisive thing.</p>

                        memorandum is an extremely fallacious article in its historical data. It
                        states repeatedly that Upper Silesia belonged to Germany for 750 years,
                        which is not at all true. Upper Silesia was Polish from the beginning; was
                        Polish for several centuries.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: You mean it was part of the Polish
                        state, or only Polish in population?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: Part of the Polish state, and it resulted
                        in there being there a Polish population. It passed from Poland to Bohemia
                        some time in 1500; from Bohemia it passed to Austria in 1600, and it passed
                        to the Germans in 1700; so it belonged to the German state, to the Germans,
                        about 200 years.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Lamont</hi>: It has not belonged to Poland for 400
                        years.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Isn’t the real point the
                        question where the coal is used after it is mined? Is it used mainly in
                        Poland today?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: No. There was a considerable export to
                        Poland, but in the main the coal was used in Eastern Germany, in the region
                        east of Berlin. Now they point out that a great part of that territory which
                        is wholly dependent on Silesia is going to Poland. Poland and West Prussia
                        do consume a great part of it. A great part of it went to Austria-Hungary
                        also.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Where did what is now new Poland
                        get her coal if she did not get it from Silesia?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: Russian Poland got about six million tons
                        a year in the Dombrowka district. There is a coal mining region in Russian
                        Poland and also a smaller coal mining region in Galicia.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: And German Poland got how much
                        of its coal from this region?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: All of it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: How much did they use?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Approximately?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: I know that in Poland this winter they

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Then Poland will get a good deal
                        more coal than she had before, if she gets this area?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: She would get a good deal more

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: After all that is probably
                        susceptible of solution in a different way; by guarantees obtained as to the
                        supply of coal, that is, putting no restrictions on the supplying of coal to
                        Germany.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Baruch</hi>: It is true that the coal and the iron
                        is more or less locked up in the mines of Germany, and, as suggested by you,
                        in the division of this territory it should be guaranteed that the coal and
                        iron should go, anyhow for a number of years until there is a chance for
                        readjustment, to the places it had gone before.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: That no restriction should be placed
                        on it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: Where it goes naturally. To do that,
                        under the present treaty Poland has a right to take over all this property,
                        the privately owned property, after the war, which is a rather unusual
                        procedure; while the Germans have developed this, the Polish government can
                        come and purchase all this property and turn it over to Polish citizens.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: They have to pay for it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: That is true, but Germany has to pay for
                        it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: How do you mean?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Summers</hi>: Germany agrees to reimburse her
                        nationals.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: You mean the property can be
                        expropriated?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: Not for public use but for private use.
                        In other words, the German government has to pay its citizens for the
                        property which the Polish government wants to take from them.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Taussig</hi>: The Polish government may take it from
                        the people who now own it, and the valuation is fixed by the Polish
                        government, without any control or supervision of any kind. I think that is
                        one of the worst provisions of the treaty.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Palmer</hi>: That is one of the unexpected results
                        of the application of the general clauses to a case with which we have not
                        been concerned at all. The general committee on Alien Enemy Property hadn’t
                        anything to do with Alsace-Lorraine or Poland, which we understood were to
                        be covered by different clauses entirely—as took place in the case of
                        Alsace-Lorraine. It is astonishing to me that there should exist in Silesia
                        any such effect as had been outlined, and I think Silesia ought to be
                        treated by itself. A large territory like that should have its own special
                        clauses covering it, because this particular language which we have adopted
                        for application under totally different circumstances, has an unexpected
                        effect.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: That had escaped my notice.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Palmer</hi>: I am not sure that it has that result,
                        Mr. President, but if it has, it should be provided for.</p>
                    <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0246"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Baruch</hi>: The economic feature of the Silesian
                        question should be taken up and have special treatment as regards the
                        distribution of the assets, and also the questions of private property and
                        other matters of that kind, and I think that it does require and is entitled
                        to special treatment.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: It is not supposed that the Polish
                        government should take that—</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: That is not in the Polish part of
                        the treaty.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: It is not in the Polish part, Mr.
                        President. Poland has been construed in this treaty as one of the Allied
                        Governments. It is in the economic clauses.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Taussig</hi>: Poland figures as one of the Allied
                        and Associated Powers, and in drafting those provisions of the Allied and
                        Associated Powers I don’t believe that it was expected that it would be a
                        constituted state, figuring in every respect as a duly constituted Allied
                        and Associated Power, but they had it in the treaty draft. I do not think,
                        Mr. President, there would be any serious difficulty in disposing of that
                        problem. I think the disposition of the German property, after it came under
                        Polish jurisdiction, would not be difficult. I think it is more a matter of
                        sentiment. The sentimental features of it are more important,—the fact of
                        depriving the Germans of property which has been German for many centuries
                        presents a more serious difficulty; there is a sentimental difficulty on
                        both sides.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: Now is there not in Paris some
                        Polish representative with whom you could discuss these economic aspects of
                        the matter at once so as to see if there is not some arrangement that would
                        not be so objectionable in regard to raw materials, and this matter of
                        expropriation?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Baruch</hi>: This might affect reparations, Mr.
                        President. This property that is taken over by the Polish government, that
                        is not to be held under the economic clauses.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: I want to ask another thing in
                        connection with the Polish coal supply. Northeast of Teschen there is a
                        large area which I understand is coal bearing and undeveloped which will
                        come to Poland. Is that correct?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: In the northeastern part of Teschen?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: No.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Northeast of Teschen.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: It does not mean the Teschen coal
                        basin. As they show the area on the map I should think it is about one-fifth
                        of a large coal area that extended northeastward into Poland. Is that well
                        established that there is a large coal bearing region there in Poland that
                        is undeveloped?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: There is a considerable area, in Galicia
                        especially, where I think they expect a large development. In general this
                        coal area <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0247"/>comes just at the
                        intersection of the old frontiers of Austria, Russia and Prussia. The basin
                        is divided between the three powers, most of it being on the Prussian side,
                        all of it being in Polish territory with very slight exceptions, and the
                        undeveloped parts are mainly towards the east, in Austria, and, to a very
                        slight extent, in what was formerly Russian territory.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: About one-twelfth of that area
                        is developed. I do not mean to say one-twelfth of the wealth, but
                        one-twelfth of the area.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: The other most prominent subject is
                        the subject of the occupation of the Rhenish Provinces for five, ten and
                        fifteen years. And I say in the same confidential way that I indicated a
                        moment ago, that Mr. Lloyd George represented his military advisers and his
                        cabinet as all together a unit that the period of occupation should extend
                        over a period of only two years, with a possibility of extending it further
                        in case the Germans refused to carry out the terms of the treaty, or in any
                        deliberate way failed to carry out the terms. That creates a very serious
                        impasse between the British and French opinion.</p>
                    <p>If I may just say a word of explanation, the French military opinion, as it
                        has been interpreted to me, does not believe that the fifteen-year
                        occupation is in any way satisfying. As I understand it, Marshal Foch wanted
                        to occupy the Rhenish provinces for thirty years, the probable period of
                        payment of reparation, and it was a compromise, I infer, which reduced it to
                        fifteen years. And they have made an arrangement under which this
                        interesting comment has been made, that the areas of occupation, one for
                        five, one for ten and one for fifteen years,—all abutting on the Rhine, of
                        course—extend in a line northwest and southeast, not east and west, and the
                        reason given me for that was that extending that way they would always
                        protect the direct route from Germany to Paris. But the direct route is not
                        the route that is at all likely to be taken.</p>
                    <p>The route that has usually been taken, and that was taken this time, is the
                        northern route, across which lies the area which is to be first evacuated,
                        and the territory next most likely to be used, from a miliary point of view,
                        is to be evacuated in ten years, and the territory which would certainly not
                        be used is to be evacuated in fifteen years. And the intimation was that the
                        real object was the control of the navigation of the Rhine. That is the last
                        area, and all this occupation touches, of course, Lorraine and the
                        commercial interests of France that center on the Rhine.</p>
                    <p>So that the question of occupation has this drawback to it: it is not
                        strictly speaking a military question, apparently. It is a means of quieting
                        public opinion during the period that Germany is certainly not going to be
                        able to do anything in a military line, and withdrawing <pb n="212"
                            xml:id="pg_212" facs="0248"/>their forces just at about the time when
                        she is likely to recuperate, which is not, if I am stating it correctly, a
                        military proposition at all.</p>
                    <p>And another very serious drawback to it—at least from the point of view of
                        several of the powers, on reparations—is that Germany is to pay for this
                        Army of Occupation, and it would cost several hundreds of millions to
                        maintain it, and those millions would come out of the reparations, and if
                        you have a fixed sum—not otherwise—it would be that much in addition to the
                        French portion of the reparations, because everyone contends that the army
                        of occupation will be French. They would not expect Great Britain and
                        ourselves to furnish more than some small number that would be sufficient to
                        keep the colors afloat and justify the name of an inter-allied force.</p>
                    <p>So I do not know who it calls for to discuss it, if I am right that it is not
                        strictly a military question, and if it is a civil question it is a question
                        involving many embarrassments, chiefly embarrassments of French public
                        opinion.</p>
                    <p>But I would be very glad if the military people would fire away at it if they
                        have anything to say.</p>

                        genuine—I mean spontaneous. I would be very suspicious of it in the present
                        circumstances.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel House</hi>: Yes, I think it is an imposture.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: Yes, I know it is.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: Mr. President, I would like to say
                        one word on that subject. I think as you just stated, it is almost entirely
                        a political question rather than a military one, because no essential
                        military objects will be accomplished by the military occupation of the
                        territories proposed to be occupied under the proposed conditions. And I
                        have never been in favor of the prolonged military occupation and I base my
                        views on two considerations: the first is the matter of good sound policy,
                        and the other sound business.</p>
                    <p>As a matter of policy I have always—and a good many other military men agree
                        with me on that—looked with apprehension on the possibilities of a military
                        occupation of a territory, the people of which we will be officially at
                        peace with for a long time. It is so likely to result in incidents that will
                        bring about the very thing that we want, of course, to avoid, and that is a
                        resumption of war. It has always seemed to me that it is almost a slap in
                        the face of the League of Nations, in which we are all so interested, to
                        assume that the execution of this treaty, extending over a long term of
                        years, can only be accomplished <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0249"/>by
                        a military force instead of by this League of Nations, which presumably at
                        an early date will be in operation.</p>
                    <p>Then you have yourself pointed out the reason why it is not sound
                        business.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ribot in the speech that he made in the French Senate the other day used
                        figures which I have no doubt are exaggerated, but they still, after making
                        a due allowance for exaggeration, indicate a wasteful amount of money that
                        would be simply eaten up in the collection of the remainder, and he
                        estimated that out of the first 25 milliards of francs that would come from
                        Germany, partly to the French and partly to the Belgians, at least 15
                        milliards of it would be eaten up in the expense of the army of occupation.
                        I think that figure is exaggerated, and he probably assumes a continuance of
                        an army of occupation approximating the present force there, which now
                        numbers a million men—a grossly exaggerated and unnecessary number for any
                        purpose that it is agreed it may be called upon to accomplish.</p>
                    <p>The Marshal’s demand is that after the signature of peace there be maintained
                        an army of thirty infantry divisions, and not to exceed five cavalry
                        divisions, which, together with all the attached services, would amount to
                        somewhere in the neighborhood of 600,000 men. It is not enough for war, on
                        the supposition that Germany could resume the war—which she cannot do—and it
                        is entirely unnecessary on the assumption that she cannot resume the war. He
                        proposes to keep that army there during the period of disarmament in
                        Germany. Now no one knows how long that will be. The Germans in their reply
                        have said that it is technically impossible to execute the clauses of the
                        treaty on which time limit was imposed, within the time limits imposed; that
                        the time limits should be prolonged, and they say the matter should be
                        subject of negotiations. And in the Marshal’s office yesterday afternoon in
                        the conference which we had, it was agreed by all that it was absolutely
                        impossible to comply with the terms, so far as the time limits are
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: Did the French agree to that?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: Oh, yes. Now how long that will
                        continue, nobody knows. But during its continuance, during all this period,
                        military control of commissions will be kept in operation, which will also
                        be contributing to the diminution of the available funds that they get out
                        of Germany for reparations and otherwise.</p>
                    <p>Now those who have read the German counter-proposals on the subject of
                        military, naval and air terms, know that they accept everything in principle
                        subject to their admission into the League of Nations, and in regard to this
                        term of occupation—whatever it be—if Germany is at any time to be admitted
                        into the League of Nations, certainly that occupation in Germany must cease
                        the moment she is so admitted. It would be intolerable, and there is no
                        provision in any part of the <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0250"
                        />Covenant for the occupation of territory of a nation which has been
                        accepted into membership in the League of Nations, which acceptance is only
                        done after you are satisfied that she has given every guarantee to comply
                        with the League’s obligations.</p>
                    <p>I understand that there has been some consideration given to a very material
                        reduction in the period of occupation, and I hope that it can be carried
                        through, and that whatever that time will be—</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: (Interrupting) By whom, General?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: Based on the German proposals, there
                        has been more or less consideration given—</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: By the French?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: Well, it has been discussed. I don’t
                        think the French are willing to consider it now, but to take not to exceed
                        four months to consider that. It might be prolonged long after that and
                        still come within the limits proposed in the treaty, and I take it if any
                        change is made at all, or if the present figures are kept to five, ten or
                        fifteen years, occupation should cease the moment Germany becomes a member
                        of the League of Nations.</p>
                    <p>Personally I hope very much that the term of occupation made by common
                        agreement will be very materially reduced.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: The only door for consideration
                        which Mr. Clemenceau said he was willing to leave open yesterday was the
                        cost. I was interested to know just what he would consider, and he said at
                        first that he would not consider the reduction of the term of occupation at
                        all, that was impossible for him, and then he subsequently said he would
                        consider it from the point of view of the cost. Now just what and how much
                        that meant I do not know; we did not go into it. But of course that is a
                        very serious side. If they agree to a fixed sum of reparation, then every
                        dollar of what has been spent on occupation is a reduction of that sum.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: It goes to support their army.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: It goes to support their army, yes,
                        but they would not otherwise be paid to support so large an army. I don’t
                        know how large an army they would otherwise have. Can you tell us,
                        General?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: Under their organic law they would
                        have 800,000 men, and I have not seen nor heard any word from any source nor
                        have I heard of any proposition being before their legislature to modify
                        that.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel House</hi>: Don’t you suppose it would be
                        possible upon these disputed questions, that is, not upon all the German
                        questions, but upon some of them, to appoint committees of the experts and
                        see what modifications, if any, could be made and agreed upon?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: Well, the plan I had in mind was to
                        have our own conference, as we were advised that Mr. Orlando was having his
                        this morning, and Mr. Clemenceau is having his,—in order that we might, <pb
                            n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0251"/>without having any of the usual
                        roundabout expressions of international intercourse, learn each other’s
                        minds, real minds, and then my idea was that each one of our groups would
                        either retire, and they, or some representatives whom they would select,
                        would meet the corresponding groups of the other countries and have an
                        exchange of views.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel House</hi>: That was what I had in mind.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: Have a clearing house.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel House</hi>: Wouldn’t it modify the general
                        selection if we knew what the commission that Mr. Davis is on is doing?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: John W. Davis?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel House</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. John W. Davis</hi>: I don’t know that that
                        commission has any more to do than to recommend the size of the army. All
                        they have to do is to draw up a scheme of the organization of the army and
                        the size.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: That might soften the blow to
                        them.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. John W. Davis</hi>: Yes, make it a little bit less
                        Draconian.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Is it possible to fix the time
                        when Germany can be admitted into the League of Nations?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: I don’t honestly think it is. I
                        think it is necessary that we should know that the change in government and
                        the governmental method in Germany is genuine and permanent. We don’t know
                        either of them yet.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: When are we going to know? When
                        are you going to get consent from all these countries, from France or the

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: I think that France would be one of

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: Do you think it would if it were
                        conditioned upon withdrawing the Army of Occupation? That is mentioned as a
                        condition upon Germany coming into the League of Nations.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: Except as to Germany paying for the
                        army. I think she would be sick of the army of occupation.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: She wants to control this from an
                        economic standpoint too.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: But I don’t see how they can do that
                        without a proper convention.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: We have a convention now, you know, with
                        them, and they are all the time springing the Economic Council, and they do
                        not stand by the convention.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: Convention of what?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: Among the Allied and Associated
                        Powers.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: But the convention I am speaking of
                        is the permanent convention, the fifteen-year convention under which there
                        would be no interference with the economic or industrial life of the country
                        whatever.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: But now I see there is a convention
                        between the Allied and Associated Powers that there would not be an

                        because it has a great deal of popular effect as to the attitude of the

                        carefully—that it is not genuine. I think that if the language in regard to
                        Poland is carefully studied it would appear more and more as a piece of
                        Polish propaganda. And knowing the probable source from which it came, and
                        the fact that the Poles are still endeavoring to circulate it—it came from
                        our legation only yesterday again, from the Polish legation at Berne, and it
                        got to England and was published there—I can have very little doubt that it
                        is an organized frameup.</p>

                        because that had come out and the others had not yet come out. They did not
                        know about the eastern Silesian coal mines at that time, but the Saar Basin
                        was the one point on which they laid the most stress. They said they would
                        give up the coal, but did not want to give up the control to France
                        entirely.</p>

                        occupation, and the Silesian coal mines. They seemed to be more insistent
                        upon that than Dantzig.</p>

                        the amount should be fixed by the Allied and Associated governments; that
                        the details should be regulated by the Allied and Associated governments.

                        clauses that does appear, and does look as if it is a deliberate attempt to
                        keep Germany from having anything to say upon questions of execution. They
                        complain about the way the quota or amount of shipping that Germany shall
                        have is to be arrived at; the Kehl harbor shall be commanded by the Rhine

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: (Interrupting) Mr. Lansing was
                        asking me if I did not think it would be a good idea to ask each of our
                        groups to prepare a memorandum of what might be conceded, and while I do not
                        want to be illiberal in the matter, I should hesitate to say “yes” to that
                        question. The question that lies in my mind is: “Where have they made good
                        in their points?” “Where have they shown that the arrangements of the treaty
                        are essentially unjust?” Not “Where have they shown merely that they are
                        hard?”, for they are hard—but the Germans earned that. And I think it is
                        profitable that a nation should learn once and for all what an unjust war
                        means in itself.</p>
                    <p>I have no desire to soften the treaty, but I have a very sincere desire to
                        alter those portions of it that are shown to be unjust, or which are shown
                        to be contrary to the principles which we ourselves have laid down.</p>
                    <p>Take the Silesian question, for example: we said in so many words in the
                        documents which were the basis of the peace, that we would make a free
                        Poland out of the districts with Polish population. Now where it can be
                        shown that the populations included in Poland are not indisputably Polish,
                        then we must resort to something like a plebiscite. I agree with Dr. Lord
                        that in the territory like northern Silesia the sincerity of the plebiscite
                        might be questioned—in fact it might be very difficult to have a plebiscite
                        that was a real expression of opinion, and therefore we would have to go by
                        what we believed was the preponderance of the wishes of the population.</p>
                    <p>But I believe that where we have included Germans unnecessarily, the border
                        ought to be rectified. Or where we have been shown to <pb n="219"
                            xml:id="pg_219" facs="0255"/>have departed from our principles, then we
                        must consider what adjustments are necessary to conform to those
                        principles.</p>
                    <p>Take Poland’s access to the sea. For strategic reasons our Polish experts—the
                        group of Allied experts—recommended a corridor running up to Dantzig and it
                        included some very solid groups of German populations. We determined in that
                        case to leave the Dantzig district to the Germans and to establish a
                        plebiscite.</p>
                    <p>Where the railway track from Dantzig to Warsaw runs, notwithstanding the
                        capital strategic importance of that railway to Poland, that railway is to
                        remain German if its population votes to remain German.</p>
                    <p>I think that we have been more successful than I supposed we could possibly
                        be in drawing ethnographic lines, because races are terribly mixed in some
                        parts of Germany where we tried to draw the line. But wherever we can
                        rectify them we ought to rectify them.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, if the reparations clauses are unjust because they won’t work—not
                        because they are putting the heavy burden of payment upon Germany (because
                        that is just)—but because we are putting it on them in such a way that they
                        cannot pay, then I think we ought to rectify that.</p>
                    <p>I put it this way: We ought to examine our consciences to see where we can
                        make modifications that correspond with the principles that we are putting
                        forth.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: That is what I say, Mr.
                        President, but I should not confine it to “injustice”; where we have made a
                        mistake I should not say it was an injustice. I should say that where it is
                        something that is contrary to good policy that I do not think that is
                        unjust; I simply think that we made an error, and we ought to correct it.
                        That was my idea of what modifications should be suggested; not that we
                        would adopt them, but to say whether it was wise to adopt them, so that we
                        would have something in writing, something to work with. It is all in the
                        air now.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: The great problem of the moment is
                        the problem of agreement, because the most fatal thing that could happen, I
                        should say, in the world, would be that sharp lines of division should be
                        drawn among the Allied and Associated Powers. They ought to be held
                        together, if it can reasonably be done, and that makes a problem like the
                        problem of occupation look almost insoluble, because the British are at one
                        extreme, and the French refusal to move is at the opposite extreme.</p>
                    <p>Personally I think the thing will solve itself upon the admission of Germany
                        to the League of Nations. I think that all the powers feel that the right
                        thing to do is to withdraw the army. But we cannot <pb n="220"
                            xml:id="pg_220" facs="0256"/>arrange that in the treaty because you
                        cannot fix the date at which Germany is to be admitted into the League. It
                        would be an indefinite one.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Would that be done only by

                        by Germany, because the French nation would not consent to making it so long
                        if they had to pay for it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel House</hi>: In a way she has to pay for it. They
                        are going to make Germany pay all she can pay. Every dollar that is taken
                        out for the army is taken away from French indemnities.</p>

                        taken away from French industries too.</p>
                    <p>What is necessary is to get out of this atmosphere of war, get out of the
                        present exaggerated feelings and exaggerated appearances, and I believe that
                        if we can once get out of them into the calmer airs it would be easier to

                        is pretty difficult.</p>

                        as just, the argument of expediency ought not to govern, because after all
                        we must not give up what we fought for. We might have to fight for it

                        getting something, rather than to lose all. And it is not a question of
                        justice; justice would require, as I see it, that they pay everything they
                        have got or hope to get. But in order to obtain something it may be
                        expedient to do this, that and the other. Much the same might apply to the

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: We have removed the only serious
                        element of injustice in that arrangement as it stood. Germany had to pay a
                        certain sum in gold at the end of the period for the mines, or else the
                        plebiscite was of no practical result. France obtained sovereignty over the
                        region. We have altered that.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: There is still the question of the
                        vote.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Haskins</hi>: There are two or three minor
                        modifications in the clauses that are necessary in the matter of
                        clarity,—Mr. White has raised one of them—where the language did not seem
                        perfectly clear.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: In order to obtain what we
                        intended?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Haskins</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: It is necessary to get peace as soon as
                        possible. If Europe does not get together, the situation is going to be
                        awful. Our appropriations have run out, practically; in about another month
                        we won’t have any money at all.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: We won’t have any appropriated
                        money, you mean?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: We won’t have any money appropriated for
                        that purpose. When real war is not being conducted it is much more difficult
                        to get money. The way people now feel about bonds, it would be difficult to
                        get money. And the sooner they can get something and issue some obligations
                        which these countries can use as a basis of credit, the better off we will
                        be.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>. If we make certain modifications in the
                        financial and economic clauses, would that not be enough, don’t you
                        think?</p>
                    <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0258"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: We feel it would, if we can get together
                        on that. Now whether these other questions are such that Germany will not
                        agree to sign, we don’t know. But I mean their reply makes us feel rather
                        hopeful that we can certainly get together on reparations.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: Well, I don’t want to seem to be
                        unreasonable, but my feeling is this: that we ought not, with the object of
                        getting it signed, make changes in the treaty, if we think that it embodies
                        what we were contending for; that the time to consider all these questions
                        was when we were writing the treaty, and it makes me a little tired for
                        people to come and say now that they are afraid the Germans won’t sign, and
                        their fear is based upon things that they insisted upon at the time of the
                        writing of the treaty; that makes me very sick.</p>
                    <p>And that is the thing that happened. These people that overrode our judgment
                        and wrote things into the treaty that are now the stumbling blocks, are
                        falling over themselves to remove these stumbling blocks. Now, if they ought
                        not to have been there, I say, remove them, but I say do not remove them
                        merely for the fact of having the treaty signed.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Do the French remind you of that?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: Not so much as the British. Here is
                        a British group made up of every kind of British opinion, from Winston
                        Churchill to Fisher. From the unreasonable to the reasonable, all the way
                        around, they are all unanimous, if you please, in their funk. Now that makes
                        me very tired. They ought to have been rational to begin with and then they
                        would not have needed to have funked at the end. They ought to have done the
                        rational things, I admit, and it is not very gracious for me to remind
                        them—though I have done so with as much grace as I could command.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis</hi>: They say that they do not quite
                        understand why you permitted them to do that.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel House</hi>: So they say you are responsible for
                        their doing it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The President</hi>: I would be perfectly willing to take
                        the responsibility if the result is good. But though we did not keep them
                        from putting irrational things in the treaty, we got very serious
                        modifications out of them. If we had written the treaty the way they wanted
                        it the Germans would have gone home the minute they read it.</p>
                    <p>Well, the Lord be with us.</p>
                    <p>Thereupon, at 1:15 p.m., the meeting adjourned.</p>

                            well to have the Section discontinued at the earliest possible moment.

                            likewise felt that Mr. Brandeis would be a very suitable individual, but
                            were not quite sure when he was arriving in Paris, and requested further
                            information on this point. In regard to the remaining members of the

                            received by the Secretary-General from Prof. Shotwell respecting the
                            request made by the Spanish Government to the effect that a Spanish
                            representative be added to the Organizing Committee of the International
                            Labor Commission. The Commissioners agreed with Prof. Shotwell’s view of
                            this matter, namely, that the admission of Spain to this Organizing
                            Committee would seem to involve departing from the plan of organization
                            already ratified. They, therefore, felt that Prof. Shotwell should
                            oppose Spain’s admission. <seg type="margin">Spanish Government’s

                            the Carinthian boundary had been put into effect at once. The

                            Martin’s memorandum, but that for the sake of the records a complete

                            which it was stated that owing to the previous telegram sent by the
                            Mission, Mr. Moore was now able to handle the situation in Tiflis. The
                            Commissioners felt that there was nothing further to be done in this

                            merely went to prove that it was unfortunate that our telegram of May 20
                            had been allowed to go out without their seeing it. <seg type="margin"

                            behalf of Col. Grant, as to whether the Delegation of the Kingdom of the
                            Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was a proper designation for the Delegation
                            which had formerly been called the Delegation of Serbia. The
                            Commissioners agreed that inasmuch as the credentials of the
                            Plenipotentiaries in question had been signed on behalf of the Kingdom
                            of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and had been accepted by the Peace
                            Conference, that this was a virtual recognition of that Kingdom. The
                            Commissioners therefore felt that Colonel Grant should insist upon this
                            designation, but should, in case a formal protest was made by the
                            Italian Government, bring the matter again to the attention of the

                            a telegram received by the Commission from the Department of State
                            inquiring whether the Commission would give a ruling as to the policy of
                            repatriating approximately 2500 German Internees in the United States in
                            case the German Government should refuse to sign the conditions of
                            Peace. It is expected that these Internees would be repatriated within
                            the next ten days. The Commissioners felt that this was not a matter for
                            the Peace Commission to decide, but Mr. Lansing as Secretary of State
                            was of the opinion that we should in any case repatriate all those
                            individuals whose repatriation was contemplated by the Prisoner of War
                            Agreement signed by representatives of the United States and Germany at

                            there would probably not be any harm in repatriating the other

                            but stated that they did not desire to send to the President a

                            altering the last paragraph so that it would not contain phrases which

                            to whether General Gough’s mission was purely British or Inter-Allied,
                            and whether or not it was expected that an American officer should be
                            assigned to it. In any case, however, they thought it inadvisable to
                            have Lt. Col. Greene as the American representative, since it was
                            contemplated sending him on a different Mission. <seg type="margin">Re

                        <item>Memorandum No. 356 was read, regarding a suggestion made by Mr. Ray
                            Stannard Baker that, if possible, it would be advisable for the American
                            newspaper correspondents to give a dinner to the British and French
                            correspondents in Paris, which might possibly be paid for by the
                            Commission. The Commissioners agreed that this was a matter which Mr.
                            Lansing alone should decide. Mr. Lansing stated that he felt it would be
                            very advisable for the Commission to pay the expenses of such a dinner,
                            but that it should only be done if it could be accomplished without
                            arousing too much criticism. He therefore asked that Mr. McNeir be
                            consulted as to the best way of covering these expenses. <seg

                        <item>Mr. Herter read a memorandum prepared by Major Tyler giving the
                            substance of a conversation which he had had on June 14th with Baron
                            Eichoff of the Austrian Delegation, together with a little supplemental
                            memorandum containing certain information which he had received from
                            that Delegation on June 15th. The Commissioners took note of these
                            memoranda with great interest. In regard to the request of Mr.
                            Frankenstein that the Austrian Delegation receive a copy of the Allies’
                            reply to the Germans, which was presumably to be presented on June 16th,
                            the Commissioners felt that they were not in a position to take any
                            action, but that the matter should formally be referred by the Austrian
                            Delegation to the Secretary-General of the Peace Commission. <seg

                            Baird who was under orders to return to the United States as a casual
                            officer, was willing to remain in France and, because of his marked
                            administrative ability, undoubtedly would be of use in connection with
                            some of the Commissions to be appointed under the Peace Treaties. The
                            Commissioners agreed that without having a specified job to offer Major
                            Baird, they could not ask for his retention in France. They, therefore,
                            felt that he had better return to the United States and be summoned back
                            to France at a later date if his services were then required. <seg

                        already been incurred by the American Representative of the Inter-Allied
                        Trade Commission in Vienna. These expenses had been paid for from the
                        allotment assigned to Prof. Coolidge for his Mission on the understanding
                        that they would later be refunded by the War Trade Board. It having been
                        found, however, that owing to difficulty of accounting, the War Trade Board
                        was unable to reimburse the Mission for these funds, Mr. McCormick inquired
                        whether the Commissioners would approve of having the Commission definitely
                        bear this expense. The Commissioners agreed that, inasmuch as the funds had
                        already been expended and would in any case, if returned after July 1st,
                        1919, be unavailable to the Commission, there would be no necessity of their
                        being refunded by the War Trade Board. <seg type="margin">Expenses of

                        Lilburns Trigg. The Commissioners requested that this telegram be answered
                        in a sense that they had no objection to these two gentlemen coming to
                        Paris, and approved of letting them come if they so desired. <seg

                        could not approve of Lieut. Berle’s release at the present time, unless he
                        could not be parsuaded to stay. They requested Mr. Herter to speak to Lieut.

                        services with the Commission, and report the result of this interview. <seg

                        services of Mr. DuBois in German Austria, but that if he were employed in
                        this capacity he would probably have to be subordinated to Mr. Halstead who
                        has already replaced Prof. Coolidge. <seg type="margin">Retention of

                    <p>5. Mr. Herter took up again the question of the release of Dr. Day and Dr.
                        Seymour from the Commission. The Commissioners on reconsidering this matter,
                        felt it would be highly advisable to have these two gentlemen stay with the
                        Commission if it were possible to persuade them to do so. They, therefore,
                        requested that both Dr. Day and Dr. Seymour come if possible to the next
                        meeting of the Commissioners to discuss with them the possibility of
                        remaining with the Commission. <seg type="margin">Release of Drs. Day and

                            President, who would volunteer to work with the Commission for a short
                            time longer. If any men volunteered, their places could be taken in the
                            Guard Detachment by enlisted men on the Commission who have the most
                            urgent reasons for returning. They therefore requested that Mr. Grew

                            gentlemen, embodying approximately the following ideas: “As you have
                            already been informed by the Secretary-General of the Commission, a copy
                            of the Senate Resolution was forwarded to the President of the Peace
                            Conference, Mr. Clemenceau, who alone is competent to bring this whole

                            sufficiently well, but I am convinced that a new man could not come into
                            the Liquidation Commission at the present time and do justice to its
                            undertaking.” They requested that Mr. Grew write Senator Hollis and
                            inquire from him whether he had in mind any other men who were available
                            in Europe and who could do the Polish job sufficiently well, since they
                            would be very glad to have suggestions of this nature. <seg

                            memorandum giving the facts in the case, but that this letter indicate

                            would be willing to have the members of the various departments of the

                            been actively engaged in assisting with the work of the Treaty, etc.,

                            with Germany would be signed, and that Mr. Grew had been greatly
                            embarrassed to know how to answer these requests. The Commissioners
                            agreed that no reply whatever should be made to any applicant, but that
                            his name should be taken by Mr. Grew and should be submitted in a list
                            to the Commissioners for definite approval. <seg type="margin">Requests

                            front, under the guidance of American officers. The Commissioners felt
                            that this was not a matter for the Peace Commission to consider, but
                            that Mr. Garrett should make his recommendations in the premises to the
                            Embassy for such action as Mr. Wallace considered appropriate. <seg

                            the Peace Commission and who had been sending in very valuable reports
                            on German political information, would shortly be obliged to leave
                            Berlin, since he was under the orders of General Harries, and <pb
                                n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0284"/>since General Harries, together
                            with his entire staff, would be obliged to leave Germany immediately
                            upon the signature of Peace. The Commissioners agreed that it would be
                            extremely advisable for Mr. Dyar to remain in Berlin and continue his
                            service with the Commission, if it were possible to make the necessary
                            arrangements. They, therefore, requested that Mr. Dresel ascertain at
                            once whether adequate Courier service could be established for Mr. Dyar
                            and whether, if a code from the Commission was sent to Mr. Dyar, the
                            German authorities would give him the privilege of using this code even
                            after the signature of Peace. <seg type="margin">Retention of Mr. Dyar

                            Lansing and his colleagues could receive the Ukrainian Delegation,
                            Messrs. Margolin, Schulgin, and Paneiko, who are at present in Paris.
                            The Commissioners agreed that they would be glad to receive the
                            Ukrainian delegates in question and fixed Friday, June 27th, at 10:45
                            a.m. as the time and date upon which they would receive them. They
                            desired, however, that it be made [known?] to the Ukrainian Delegates
                            that there was just a possibility of the Commissioners not being able to
                            meet them at the time indicated, because of unforeseen eventualities;
                            but, in that case, they would certainly see them in the coming week.

                            The Commissioners considered very carefully the conditions upon which
                            Professor Johnson stated he would be willing to stay with the
                            Commission, and while agreeing entirely with the reasonableness of his

                            fulfillment. They, therefore, requested Mr. White to consult with Mr.

                    <p>1. Memorandum No. 409 was read, regarding an interview between Dr. Ussher and
                        Damad Ferid Pacha. The Commissioners approved of Dr. Ussher’s having the
                        interview, provided the proper arrangements could be made therefor. <seg

                    <p>2. Memorandum No. 410, quoting a memorandum from Brigadier-General C. H.
                        McKinstry, U. S. A., requesting that he be released from the Commission as
                        soon as practical, in order to return to the United States. The
                        Commissioners agreed that they would approve of General McKinstry’s release
                        from the Commission on or about July 15th. <seg type="margin">Release of

                    <p>3. Mr. Herter read a memorandum addressed to Mr. Lansing by Mr. Mills, the
                        secretary to Mr. Vance C. McCormick, with respect to the latter’s returning
                        to the United States and taking with him as personal property copies of the
                        Minutes of the meetings of the Council of Ten and the Council of Five which
                        had been sent to his office for official use. The Commissioners agreed that
                        there would be no objection to Mr. McCormick’s retaining the documents in
                        question. <seg type="margin">Request of Mr. McCormick for Copies of

                    <p>4. Memorandum No. 411 was read, inquiring whether the Commissioners were
                        willing to appoint immediately an American representative on the
                        International Schleswig Commission, and whether they desired that
                        instructions be sent to the American Ministers in Stockholm and Christiania,
                        to urge the Swedish and Norwegian governments respectively to likewise
                        appoint members on the International Schleswig Commission. <seg

                    <p>The Commissioners referred to General Bliss the matter of suggesting the name
                        of an Army officer who would be properly qualified to serve on the
                        International Schleswig Commission, and, at the same time, stated that they
                        approved of having instructions, as indicated, sent to the American
                        Ministers in Stockholm and Christiania.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the above, the Commissioners requested that letters be
                        drafted for Mr. Lansing’s signature to Messrs. Pichon, Balfour, and, if
                        necessary, Tittoni, stating that the United States favored strongly the
                        appointment of a neutral chairman on the International Schleswig
                        Commission.</p>
                    <p>5. The Commissioners discussed the question of the appointment of an
                        arbitrator or arbitrators, as provided by Article 339 in the Treaty of
                        Peace, provisionally to study the questions connected with the cession and
                        distribution of river craft on the Danube, pending the ratification of the
                        Treaty of Peace. The matter was referred to Admiral Knapp with the request
                        that he suggest, if possible, the name of some Naval officer who would be
                        properly qualified to undertake this work. <seg type="margin">Appointment of

                        <item>Memorandum No. 412 was read, in which Mr. Pierrepont Noyes, the
                            American Commissioner on the Rhineland Commission, requested the opinion
                            of the Commissioners as to the stand he should take after the withdrawal
                            of the American Army of Occupation in regard to a possible Rhineland
                            rebellion or revolution. Mr. Lansing stated that he had spoken to Mr.
                            Noyes about this matter on the previous day and that he had at that time
                            told him that he should discourage any change in the civil situation in
                            the Rhineland provinces under occupation. An armistice leaves matters,
                            particularly of a civil character, <hi rend="italic">in statu quo</hi>,
                            and it is the duty of the occupying authorities to maintain it. The
                            Commissioners agreed entirely with Mr. Lansing’s statement of the case,
                            but added that if, in the future, any radical change should take place
                            in Germany, that is, in Germany east of the Rhine, it would then be
                            advisable for Mr. Noyes to again request instructions from the
                            Commissioners on the attitude which he should adopt. <seg type="margin"

                            with the suggestions made in this memorandum. The Secretary-General

                        <item>Both Messrs. Margolin and Paneiko spoke in Russian and their remarks

                    <p>Mr. Paneiko spoke first on behalf of the Ukrainians of Galicia. He emphasized
                        the fact that for 600 years his people had been trying to gain their
                        freedom. In particular the domination of the Poles in Eastern Galicia had
                        been very irksome to them. They were very much worried at learning that a
                        large part of the territory in which they lived was now to be subjected by
                        the Peace Conference to Polish rule, and this anxiety was increased by the
                        many stories of maltreatment of their fellow-citizens which they had
                        recently been receiving. Nevertheless, they were willing to accept the
                        decision of the Peace Conference in the hope that the Polish occupation
                        would only be temporary and that this whole question would later be
                        reconsidered by the League of Nations.</p>
                    <p>The territory from which he came, Mr. Paneiko said, had in late years
                        experienced five different occupations. The people craved for peace and the
                        permission to pursue their lives in quiet. The Poles would not be able to
                        keep this peace, there would always be sporadic revolts. On behalf of his
                        people he requested that an impartial judge or tribunal be established upon
                        the territory to judge impartially of the conditions and to decide the
                        ultimate fate of the people. An Englishman or an American would be most
                        welcome.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Margolin then spoke on behalf of the Ukraine as a whole. He said that he
                        had come to ask for assistance—assistance of three kinds, moral, technical
                        and economic. He would prelude his request for moral assistance by stating
                        that the former Russia no longer existed. It had been divided up into
                        several parts, each one of which had established its own government. At the
                        moment, excluding Siberia and Great Russia, there were twelve such separate
                        sections. All the governments in these sections have as their fundamental
                        idea the preservation of law and order and were against Bolshevism. The only
                        rational way of treating these people would be to recognize them all
                        provisionally as <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> governments until a
                        Democratic Constituent [Assembly?] could be called. It would be very
                        possible that when these various Constituents were called, they would all
                        elect to participate in a Federalized Russia.</p>
                    <p>He went on to say that it was very difficult for his people to acknowledge
                        that either Koltchak or Denekin had the authority to speak for all of
                        Russia, including The Ukraine, instead of for only those parts which they
                        controlled. Denekin and Koltchak had received aid and a practical
                        recognition from the Allied and Associated Governments in their fight
                        against Bolshevism. Why could not The Ukraine be <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254"
                            facs="0290"/>given similar assistance? The only real outstanding
                        political difference between the two was that while Koltchak had pledged
                        himself to creating a General Constituent Assembly for the whole of Russia,
                        The Ukraine desired local Constituent Assemblies, which would realty
                        represent the wishes of the various peoples. For instance, if Koltchak
                        should call a Great Assembly, the Ukrainians would not send delegates to it,
                        because they would know beforehand that they would be in the minority and
                        that their interests would be sacrificed to the interests of the Great
                        Russians.</p>
                    <p>In regard to technical assistance, Mr. Margolin stated that he wished very
                        much to have American technical help in the development of his country.
                        Possibly an American mission could be sent which would not only go to
                        Galicia but to Odessa and the rest of The Ukraine. Some five weeks ago a
                        French mission had been promised for Eastern Galicia, but it never
                        materialized. Unless some mission of officers with experience, together with
                        equipment and munitions, could be sent in the near future, Mr. Margolin
                        feared that anarchy might result throughout The Ukraine.</p>
                    <p>Economic assistance was indispensable to The Ukraine, according to Mr.
                        Margolin, where industry had been practically ruined; she was badly in need
                        of foreign capital; her transportation system had completely broken down and
                        she required expert advice and assistance in rebuilding it; whereas she has
                        an excellent river system throughout her territory, she was unable to
                        develop this system because she had not the capital to dam and canalize her
                        great river arteries. She would be only too willing to make concessions to
                        American capitalists or engineers. The French were already looking over the
                        field, but The Ukrainians would welcome Americans ahead of Frenchmen.</p>
                    <p>At this point Mr. Lansing inquired what future the Ukrainian Delegation felt
                        was in store for their country. Mr. Margolin replied that the idea of
                        federation had been born in The Ukraine and had been fostered there for many
                        years. In fact, The Ukrainians had often desired that the old Russian Empire
                        be reorganized, giving various states within the Empire a certain degree of
                        autonomy within a federalized state. Recently, however, Bolshevism and
                        Bolshevik Russia had killed this idea of federalization. The Ukrainian
                        people could not have federalization imposed upon them from above. It would
                        therefore be much better to begin from below; give the small
                        semi-independent parts provisional recognition and then let their respective
                        Constituent Assemblies decide the greater question of federalization.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing then inquired whether there was Bolshevist control in The Ukraine
                        or how strong the Bolshevist minority in the Ukraine was at the present
                        moment. Mr. Margolin replied that the Russian and Ukrainian peasants were
                        all naturally conservative and against Bolshevism. Bolshevik bands had,
                        however, invaded the Ukraine <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0291"/>in
                        spots and had completely possessed themselves of certain industrial centers
                        such as Kiev and other cities. It could hardly be said that the Bolshevists
                        were in control of large portions of the country but they had seized a large
                        part of the administrative machinery and thereby were able to maintain a
                        partial control.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing then inquired if it was not true that The Ukrainians were really
                        working for much the same ends as Koltchak and Denekin. If this were true,
                        why did they not join hands with these leaders and arrange that some system
                        of autonomy be granted to them under their leadership. To this both the
                        Ukrainian delegates replied that they had already spoken to Malakoff, who
                        represented Admiral Koltchak in Paris, but that the latter was rather
                        untractable. He felt that he spoke in the name of all of Russia and was not
                        willing to come to any definite agreement. The question of the Constituent
                        Assemblies made it difficult for them to agree.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing stated definitely that the United States was not in favor of
                        independence for the Ukrainians but that it was in favor of a single Russia,
                        in which the various portions should have a certain degree of autonomy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Margolin replied to this that only a Constituent Assembly called by the
                        Ukrainians could decide this question of federalization. If the Ukrainian
                        delegates had proper guarantees from Admiral Koltchak that their people
                        would be given the proper degree of autonomy, they would be only too glad to
                        join a federalized Russia.</p>
                    <p>Only in the event that the Ukrainians come to an agreement with Admiral
                        Koltchak, said Mr. Lansing, would it be possible for the United States to
                        give to it proper support in material and technical help. It appeared to
                        him, however, that the Ukrainian delegation was going at the matter entirely
                        wrong; that it should ask for assistance in a different way. As yet the
                        United States had recognized no part of Russia, except the countries which
                        should by rights remain permanently independent, such as Finland and Poland.
                        They could not recognize even provisionally the independence of The Ukraine.
                        If, however, as he had said before, the Ukrainian delegation could make a
                        suitable agreement with Admiral Koltchak, conditions might be different.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Margolin concluded by stating that he feared that his people would be
                        afraid of Great Russian control unless he made them some very definite
                        promises and that they would likewise never agree to vote for a general
                        Constituent Assembly. He likewise added that his people might very much
                        resent being handed over to the domination of the Poles, Czecho-Slovaks and
                        Roumanians without being consulted. To this Mr. Lansing replied that
                        self-determination would govern the transfer of any Ukrainian from one
                        country to another.</p>

                            on or about July 15. The Commissioners stated that they had understood
                            from Mr. Grew that Lt. Smith would replace Mr. Patchin, provided Mr.
                            Patchin’s release was approved, and they therefore felt that they <pb
                                n="257" xml:id="pg_257" facs="0293"/>would be unable to approve of
                            Lt. Smith’s release, unless Mr. Grew could report favorably thereon and
                            explain satisfactorily how the vacancy which would be created by Mr.
                            Patchin’s release could properly be filled. In this connection the
                            Commissioners stated that it was the duty of the chief of each bureau to
                            see that his bureau was not depleted in its personnel to such an extent
                            as to harm the work which still has to be done, and that it would be
                            necessary therefore in future to have every request from an applicant
                            for release approved by the chief of the bureau in which that applicant
                            was employed. <seg type="margin">Request of Lieut. Smith for

                            Colonel House’s office. The Commissioners felt that they could not
                            release the Naval personnel referred to in Mr. Auchincloss’ letter,
                            without the approval of Admiral Knapp, and therefore requested that this
                            matter be referred to him. <seg type="margin">Release of Personnel in

                        <item>In regard to Mr. Shepardson and Mr. Auchincloss, they noted the fact
                            that these gentlemen’s resignations had already been accepted. They
                            inquired, however, as to the status of Miss Frances B. Denton. They had
                            been under the impression that she was a personal employee of Col.
                            House’s and that therefore there would be no necessity of their
                            approving or disapproving her release from the Commission or having her
                            name removed from the rolls of the Commission. Mr. Frazier’s release was
                            approved of, but the Commissioners stated they could take no action in
                            the case of Miss Marcou and Mr. W. S. Byars without first receiving an
                            expression of opinion in the premises from Mr. Grew.</item>

                        <item>Memorandum No. 422 was read, quoting a letter from Messrs. Morgenthau,

                            the expenses of these gentlemen on their trip to Poland, together with
                            authorization to Purchase three Cadillac limousines and one Cadillac

                            personnel. The Commissioners approved of an initial appropriation of
                            $10,000 for the expenses of this Commission, as well as the purchase of
                            two Cadillac limousines and one Cadillac touring car, together with the

                        <item>A memorandum addressed by Lieut. R. C. Foster to Mr. Grew, dated June
                            30, 1919, was read to the Commissioners. In this memorandum Lt. Foster
                            stated that, owing to his experience in Poland he felt under certain
                            obligations to accept Mr. Morgenthau’s invitation to accompany him on
                            his visit of investigation of the Jewish question in Poland and that
                            therefore he requested the Commissioners to suspend action on the
                            question of his release and, at the same time, hold up his papers
                            applying for his discharge from the United States Army. The
                            Commissioners approved entirely of Lieut. Foster’s remaining with the
                            Commission for duty with the special commission for the investigation of
                            the Jewish question in Poland and likewise his retention in the Army.

                            Captain D. B. Gilchrist, Librarian of the Commission, in regard to the
                            disposition of the Commission Library. The Commissioners felt that it
                            would not be wise to plan to have the Library completely closed up and
                            therefore requested that Capt. Gilchrist leave the library <hi
                                rend="italic">in statu quo</hi> unless at a later date it should be
                            found advisable to close it down. At the same time, the Commissioners
                            requested that Captain Gilchrist submit a report as to the exact status
                            of the Library, with particular reference to the nature of the material
                            which he had in the library, the source from which this material came,
                            and the funds which provided it. They likewise desire a report from
                            Captain Gilchrist as to a statement made to one of the Commissioners
                            that some of the books in the library had recently been sent to G–2, at
                            Chaumont, when these books had been purchased by money belonging to the
                            Commission and were therefore the property of the Department of State.
                            They felt that if this report were exact, the individual responsible for
                            the transfer of this State Department property to the Army would have to
                            be directly responsible for them and for any loss which might have been
                            incurred. <seg type="margin">Library of the Commission</seg></item>

                        <item>Memorandum No. 425 was read, inquiring whether the Commissioners
                            desired to authorize the use of a portion of the funds allotted to the
                            American Section of the International Commission on Mandates in Turkey,
                            for the purchase of motor cars for their use in Constantinople and in
                            Turkey. The Commissioners stated that they had no objection to the
                            purchase of these cars in question by the members <pb n="259"
                                xml:id="pg_259" facs="0295"/>of the American Section of the

                            Constantinople as soon as they were no longer required by Messrs. King

                            Poole, formerly American Consul and Acting Consul General of the U. S.
                            at Archangel to report in Paris for the purpose of meeting the
                            Commissioners. The Commissioners felt that it would be extremely well
                            worth while to have Mr. Poole come to Paris and were extremely anxious
                            to receive from him a first-hand statement in regard to the affairs in
                            the north of Russia. They therefore requested that the State Department
                            be asked to order Mr. Poole to Paris to report to the Commission. <seg

                            Peace Treaty and to submit to them a list of suggested names in each

                            requested that they have presented to them a list of the individuals
                            whom Mr. Grew [considered?] to be properly qualified to serve on such a
                            committee. <seg type="margin">Appointment of Committee for Suggestion of

                    <p>In regard to the appointment of Mr. Grant Smith on the Commission to deal
                        with the Schleswig question, the Commissioners requested that a telegram be
                        drafted to the Department of State to the effect that they consider it
                        highly improper that a member of the American Legation in Denmark should be
                        appointed on such a commission. They likewise desire that the State
                        Department be informed that they were endeavoring to secure a competent army
                        officer with experience in other fields where plebiscites were taking place,
                        to fill this post. They also suggested that the State Department take up
                        with the War Department the question of the assignment of such an officer,
                        at the same time inquiring whether Colonel Solbert, at present American
                        Military attaché in London, could be made available for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>The meeting adjourned at 11:30 and reconvened at 12 noon. Mr. Hoover, Col.
                        Logan and Mr. Hudson entered the meeting. Mr. Hoover stated that he had come
                        to the Commissioners to discuss the whole Hungarian question in general and
                        the matter of opening up the Danube in particular. The normal functioning of
                        the river trade on the Danube was one of the chief clues to settling the
                        entire Central European problem. This, at the present time, was impossible
                        with Bela Kun in power at Budapest. The time had now come when the Allied
                        and Associated Powers would either have to negotiate with <pb n="260"
                            xml:id="pg_260" facs="0296"/>Bela Kun or else throw him out by force of
                        arms. All of the British and American economic and food relief experts were
                        strongly of the opinion that he should be thrown out. In any case, a
                        decision would have to be taken very urgently, and only the Supreme Council
                        could make such a decision.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hoover then read a memorandum prepared by Col. Logan, embodying many
                        facts which have been collected in regard to Bela Kun’s activities and the
                        necessity of supplanting his government by some better balanced
                        organization. Mr. Hoover was convinced that the two French divisions at
                        present in the Southeast of Europe were fully capable of accomplishing this
                        act. It would be inopportune to allow either the Czecho-Slovaks, Jugo-Slavs
                        or the Roumanians to invade Hungary, because of the fact that the present
                        Hungarian army contained a very large Nationalist element which had not
                        turned Red and which would resent any occupation which appeared to have an
                        ulterior motive.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners agreed that this was a very urgent question and they
                        therefore requested Mr. Hoover to send to them copies of a memorandum
                        embodying his ideas on this subject, which they stated they would then have
                        circulated to the members of the Council of Ten, with a view to having the
                        matter discussed at an early meeting of that Body.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hoover then inquired as to the present status of Upper Silesia. He
                        explained that the coal fields in this region constituted the most important
                        source of coal for Central Europe and that unless some stable arrangement
                        were made in that district for the proper allocation of coal to various
                        states interested, there would be constant dissatisfaction in that region.
                        He was convinced that by an informal arrangement between Germany,
                        Czecho-Slovakia and Poland, it would be possible for an American coal
                        dictator to be named who would have full control over the allocation of coal
                        from this whole district to the different sections where it was needed. The
                        Commissioners expressed their approval of such an arrangement being effected
                        if possible.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners discussed with Mr. Hoover the question of the appointment
                        of an American arbitrator or arbitrators provided for in the Treaty of
                        Peace, to determine the cession and distribution of canal boats, etc. on the
                        Danube, Oder, Elbe, etc. Mr. Hoover explained that this was a very vital
                        problem which required immediate attention and that he, in his capacity as
                        chairman of the Supreme Economic Council or as director of Relief in Europe
                        would be glad to make the appointment of the individual whom the
                        Commissioners might select for this purpose, in order that that individual
                        might familiarize himself with conditions before he could receive his final
                        appointment as arbitrator after the ratification of the treaty. Mr. Hudson
                            <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0297"/>suggested that Mr. Chamberlain,
                        of New York, would be an excellent man for this position owing to the fact
                        that he had made a special study of transportation problems in Europe with
                        particular reference to the Danube. Mr. Hoover suggested that, because of
                        the excellent organization in the navy it might be possible to obtain
                        cooperation between some naval expert and Mr. Chamberlain, but that in any
                        case he would be glad to consult with Admiral Knapp on this point.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners discussed the question of an American mandate over Armenia
                        and Constantinople. Mr. Hoover expressed himself as being very adverse to
                        the United States becoming the mandatory power in Armenia alone for the
                        following reasons:</p>
                    <p>Armenia was the poorhouse of Europe. It was at present overrun with Turks and
                        in order to repatriate the Armenians an equivalent number of Turks would
                        have to be replaced. This would require an army, and an army of at least
                        50,000 to 100,000 men. … Altogether such an undertaking would cost the
                        United States at least $100,000,000 a year for many years.</p>
                    <p>In Mesopotamia, however, the situation was very different. This was the
                        richest and most fertile country of Asia Minor and could easily be developed
                        to support an additional population of from 5,000,000 to 10,000,000 people.
                        It would therefore be only fair to the power which took a mandate over
                        Armenia to give it at the same time a mandate over Mesopotamia. The British
                        had, however, spent a great deal of money and shed much blood in order to
                        become the possessors of Mesopotamia, and it would therefore be very
                        difficult to oust them from this country. Accordingly, Mr. Hoover suggested
                        that the British be told that the United States would be glad to take a
                        mandate over Armenia provided they were able to have Mesopotamia at the same
                        time. Or that, vice versa, that if Great Britain wished to maintain a
                        mandate over Mesopotamia, they should at the same time assume the same
                        obligation for Armenia. He was convinced that the British would rather bear
                        the burden of Armenia than run the risk of losing Mesopotamia.</p>
                    <p>In regard to Constantinople, Mr. Hoover felt that it would be a terrific
                        burden and a public act of charity for the United States to take a mandate
                        over this city, or of the area in which the city would be located. At the
                        present time the city has a population of 2,000,000 people and is entirely
                        without any economic resources or any hinterland. As a port, it serves no
                        purpose except as the gateway to the Black Sea, as a coaling station, and as
                        a home for pilots. Modern conditions of traffic no longer made it necessary
                        for ships even to stop in the port, and that it was inevitable, therefore,
                        that the city should soon be reduced to about 200,000 inhabitants, or else
                        that the 2,000,000 inhabitants <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0298"
                        />should be supported as a matter of charity of some Great Power. Mr. Hoover
                        thought that France would be the logical power to receive a mandate over
                        this City because of her future associations which France would undoubtedly
                        have with Russia.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners inquired of Mr. Hoover his opinion in regard to the
                        appointment of Mr. John Gade as a civil commissioner to go to the Baltic
                        Provinces as suggested by Mr. Polk. Mr. Hoover thought that this would not
                        be a very advisable appointment and that Colonel Greene was much the best
                        person to act as the American representative in these provinces.</p>

                            Colonel Greene summed up, briefly, for the Commissioners the situation
                            in the Baltic States, and, at the same time, submitted a written report
                            as to conditions in that district as he had found them. He, likewise,
                            made certain recommendations as to the way in which the situation in
                            that district should be treated. After some discussion, it was decided
                            that General Bliss and Colonel Greene should see Mr. Bakmetieff,
                            formerly Russian Ambassador to Washington, as to the best course to
                            pursue in regard to the Baltic states. In this connection, Mr. Lansing
                            again outlined briefly the policy which he felt that the United States
                            should pursue in regard to Russia and the small states bordering on
                            Russia which now desire independence. This policy was substantially <pb
                                n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0300"/>the same as that which he
                            outlined to the Ukrainian Delegation two days previously. <seg

                    <p>The meeting adjourned at 11:30 and re-convened at 12 noon.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hoover entered the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hoover stated that he had come to again discuss with the Commissioners
                        the question of relief in Armenia. He stated that he understood that General
                        Harbord was to be sent to Armenia to investigate conditions in that country
                        and to report as to the total number of troops which would be required to
                        repatriate the Armenian population and keep the country in order. To send
                        General Harbord in this capacity, Mr. Hoover felt would be very unwise, and,
                        at the same time, to realize the difficulty of giving to General Harbord an
                        administrative position without supplying him with a great number of troops.
                        At the same time he felt that by sending General Harbord to Armenia, the
                        American Commission would be doing an involuntary piece of propaganda,
                        looking towards the acceptance by the United States of a mandate over that
                        country.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hoover then described the work which had been done in Russian Armenia by
                        the Commission of the Far [<hi rend="italic">Near?</hi>] East, to assist in
                        relieving hunger and want. … In Mr. Hoover’s opinion, a single competent
                        official should be sent to Armenia, to whom Mr. Hoover could turn over all
                        the foodstuffs now in that district for distribution and to whom the
                        Commission of the Far East should be required to turn over its funds for
                        relief purposes. Such a person, if invested with proper authority by the
                        Supreme Council in Paris, could become a virtual dictator in that country
                        and could develop a proper and competent administration.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hoover read a memorandum which he had prepared in regard to the whole
                        Armenian situation. The Commissioners agreed that the substance of this
                        memorandum should be embodied in any reply that was sent to the telegram
                        which had been received by the Commissioners from a committee, of which
                        Charles E. Hughes was the chairman, and which had asked certain specific
                        questions in regard to Armenia.<note n="99" xml:id="d100fn99">For this
                            telegram, see <ref target="frus1919v02#pg_824"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                                824</ref>.</note> Mr. Hoover felt, however, that if this were done,
                        there should be added to this memorandum a statement to the effect that no
                        action should be taken by the United States in Armenia without a complete
                        and very thorough investigation of the geographical boundaries which would
                        be given to this country because of the tremendous economic importance of
                        these boundaries.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners decided that Mr. Hoover, with Mr. Morgenthau and Mr.
                        Buckler, should draft an appropriate reply to Mr. Hughes.<note n="1"

                    <p>1. General Bliss stated that General Pershing had recommended that the
                        American to be designated on the Schleswig Commission, provided for by the
                        Treaty of Peace, should be General Sladen. The Commissioners agreed this
                        would be a better appointment than Col. Solbert, and requested, therefore,
                        that a telegram be drafted to the Department of State, asking it to take up
                        with the War Department the question as to whether General Sladen would
                        later be available for this post, and, at the same time, stating that the
                        Mission feels that, because of Col. Solbert’s association with the Legation
                        at Copenhagen, which the Commissioners had just discovered, he would not be
                        the most suitable person. <seg type="margin">General Sladen for Schleswig

                        with his proposed work for the International Secretariat of the League of

                        to authorize the payment by the Disbursing Officer of a sum of $225 per week
                        for the maintenance of the Committee on Public Information News Service from
                        the New York office. The Commissioners approved entirely of the

                    <p>6. Memorandum No. 437 was read, stating that Mr. Whitney Shepardson proposed
                        to assist Mr. Raymond Fosdick, whom Sir Eric Drummond had asked to assist
                        him on the International Secretariat of the League of Nations, subject to

                        was none of their business what Mr. Shepardson did after leaving the

                    <p>4. Memorandum No. 439, with regard to the request of Lieut. A. V. Ferreira,
                        on duty in the Reception Room, to be relieved from duty <pb n="270"
                            xml:id="pg_270" facs="0306"/>in order that he may be assigned to the

                            Ferreira’s Release</seg></p>
                    <p>Before taking action on this request, the Commissioners desired to be
                        informed by Mr. Patchin whether he has someone available to take Lieut.
                        Ferreira’s place in the Reception Room.</p>
                    <p>5. A memorandum prepared by Mr. Morgenthau, requesting that Mr. H. C.
                        Jacquith be added to the personnel of the Mission to Poland, was read and
                        approved by the Commissioners. <seg type="margin">Assignment Mr. H. C.

                    <p>6. Mr. Buckler entered the meeting and offered a memorandum regarding the
                        question of Armenian relief. The Commissioners approved the recommendation
                        contained in the memorandum, that the British authorities be requested to
                        consult General Milne as to the possibility of immediately repatriating a
                        certain number of Armenian refugees. Their protection, until Armenia
                        receives a mandatory, would devolve upon the British forces, while their
                        food would be supplied, as at present, by the American Relief organization.
                            <seg type="margin">Armenian Relief</seg></p>
                    <p>6 [<hi rend="italic">7</hi>]. By direction of Mr. Grew, Mr. Harrison inquired
                        as to the wishes of the Commissioners regarding the use of the Hotel Crillon
                        and 4 Place de la Concorde for the parade on July 14th, and whether they
                        would approve of Mr. Grew’s proposal to use the Versailles list as a basis
                        for the list of invitations. <seg type="margin">Space on Crillon Balconies
                            for Parade July 14th</seg></p>
                    <p>The Commissioners approved Mr. Grew’s proceeding in this manner and expressed
                        a desire that the first floor of the Crillon should be reserved for the use
                        of the Commissioners. The Commissioners also suggested that it would be
                        desirable for Mr. Grew to have an estimate made of the remainder of the
                        space available in the Crillon and No. 4 Place de La Concorde, and that this
                        space should not be overcrowded.</p>

                    <p>1. Memorandum No. 440, with regard to the reply to the Austrian notes, as
                        intimated by a member of the British Delegation, speaking informally, was
                        read and noted by the Commissioners. <seg type="margin">Reply to Austrian
                            Notes</seg></p>
                    <p>2. Memorandum No. 441 was read, recommending the solution of the Teschen
                        question at an early date. The Commissioners felt that if possible it would
                        be best to allow the Poles and the Czecho-Slovaks to settle this question
                        amicably by themselves, but that, at the same time, this should be done in
                        the very near future, and therefore requested that Professor Coolidge draw
                        up a resolution for the Council of Five to consider, to the effect that Mr.
                        Paderewski and Mr. Benes be requested to settle this problem within a given
                        time limit or else be prepared to accept a solution laid down for them by
                        the five Great Powers. <seg type="margin">Solution of the Teschen
                            Question</seg></p>
                    <p>3. Memorandum No. 442 was read, in which Colonel Sherman Miles requested that
                        he be relieved from duty with the Commission. <seg type="margin">Release of
                            Colonel Miles</seg></p>
                    <p>The Commissioners approved of the release of Colonel Miles.</p>
                    <p>4. Memorandum No. 443 was read, in which Captain Walter Peirce, in charge of
                        the translation bureau, requested that Captain Percy A. Chapman be assigned
                        to duty in his Office. <seg type="margin">Assignment of Captain Percy A.
                            Chapman</seg></p>
                    <p>The Commissioners approved of the assignment of Captain Chapman.</p>
                    <p>5. Mr. Herter read a memorandum prepared by Mr. Arthur Sweetser, in which he
                        requested that he be relieved from duty with the Commission on or about July
                        20th. <seg type="margin">Release of Mr. Sweetser</seg></p>
                    <p>The Commissioners accepted Mr. Sweetser’s resignation, as effective on or
                        about July 20th, provided Mr. Grew had no objections thereto.</p>
                    <p>6. Mr. Herter read a memorandum from Colonel Warwick Greene, regarding the
                        situation in the Baltic provinces.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners noted this memorandum, but felt that they were not in a
                        position to take any action upon the recommendations made by Colonel Greene,
                        and requested that Colonel Greene speak to General Bliss in regard to this
                        matter as soon as possible. <seg type="margin">Situation in the Baltic
                            Provinces</seg></p>
                    <p>7. Mr. Herter read a memorandum prepared by Mr. Buckler, in regard to the
                        situation in Asia Minor.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners felt that Mr. Buckler’s recommendations would be very
                        difficult to carry out and that it would be better to wait a few days before
                        taking any definite action in this matter, until the attitude of the <pb

                            Asia Minor</seg></p>
                    <p>8. A telegram, containing congratulatory messages to the Commissioners for
                        the Fourth of July, signed by the Executive Committee of the Unredeemed
                        Hellenes, was read and noted by the Commissioners. <seg type="margin"
                            >Telegram From Hellenes</seg></p>
                    <p>9. Professor Coolidge and Mr. Dulles entered the meeting. Professor Coolidge
                        inquired what attitude he should assume in regard to the Austrian
                        counter-proposals with respect to the Northern frontier. He explained his
                        own point of view in regard to this matter and inquired how far the
                        Commissioners were willing to back him in demanding that certain
                        rectifications be made in favor of Austria. <seg type="margin">Professor
                            Coolidge Mr. Dulles</seg></p>
                    <p>The Commissioners authorized Professor Coolidge to at least insist upon the
                        historical boundary between Bohemia and Austria, and, at the same time, to
                        ascertain whether the Czecho-Slovaks would make concessions beyond that
                        line, provided their claims to the area on the south bank of the Danube
                        opposite Presbourg were granted.</p>
                    <p>Professor Coolidge left the meeting and Mr. McNeir and Lieutenant Condon
                        entered the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Referring<note n="4" xml:id="d104fn4">The text of this and the three
                            following paragraphs is that of a correction issued later.</note> to his
                        application for release from the Commission, Mr. McNeir informed the
                        Commissioners that he had presented his request for permission to return to
                        the United States as it appeared that his presence was required in the
                        Department of State. He would, however, remain if the Commissioners desired
                        him to do so. The Commissioners agreed that it would be very desirable for
                        Mr. McNeir to remain and asked his views as to the arrangements which it
                        would be now necessary to make in regard to the personnel of the Commission
                        and the maintenance of quarters for the Commission.</p>
                    <p>Mr. McNeir recommended that the entire management of the Commission should be
                        placed as far as possible upon a civilian basis and proposed that the office
                        of the Administrative Officer might be done away with and that a number of
                        the military personnel attached to that office might be released. He
                        suggested that Mr. Harry Young should be placed in charge of the hotel under
                        his general supervision.</p>
                    <p>Mr. McNeir further recommended that if Mr. Patchin should leave as seemed to
                        be probable, Mr. Welsh should be appointed Executive Secretary of the
                        Commission to act under his supervision.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners approved of having the management of the Commission
                        civilianized as far as possible and desired that Mr. McNeir should consult
                        with Mr. Grew regarding the suggestion he had put forward. Any changes in
                        the organization of the Commission should, of course, be subject to Mr.
                        Grew’s approval.</p>

                            reported that there had been further serious incidents; that one of the

                    <p>The Commissioners called the meeting. Mr. Lansing explained their purpose in

                        he had a very important meeting at half-past ten at the Quai d’Orsay which
                        might prevent his being present at this meeting, and asked to have that fact
                        reported to you.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: I don’t know who was on that

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: I haven’t any information about
                        it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major Johnson</hi>: I didn’t know that any special

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major Johnson</hi>: I think that a commission had been
                        sent to Montenegro.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: If I remember correctly, Mr.
                        Secretary, I think somebody who was a military observer for those countries
                        was instructed through the embassy in Rome, to make an investigation and
                        report. I don’t remember his name.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: That was several months ago.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major Johnson</hi>: That was several months ago.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: Is the report in?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major Johnson</hi>: Yes, he is here in Paris at this
                        moment. Sherman Miles.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: We had better find out what his
                        views are.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: Did he ever report to you,
                        General?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: No. I think the matter that you
                        refer to was when they sent over two officers who were attached to the
                        embassy in Borne; they went over—I don’t know under whose instructions,—and
                        they made reports several months ago. Since then I have heard of no
                        commission there.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: What does that mean—the 28th?
                        Has there been a further discussion?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: No, this was not the 28th. This was
                        some time before.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Who is directly handling the

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major Johnson</hi>: I suppose it came up in connection
                        with the Rumanian and Jugo-Slav question.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: I should think so. Or the
                        Balkan.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major Johnson</hi>: The question came up in the
                        Jugo-Slav Territorial Commission; my impression is that it was referred to
                        the Albanian and Greek Commission.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: 3rd: Italian Claims in the Adriatic.
                        That is being handled.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Yes, that is still under

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Is there going to be one?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: If it takes place. The 5th is also on
                        the agenda for this afternoon: Frontiers of Jugo-Slavia with Hungary in:

                        22, 1919.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major Johnson</hi>: That has not been acted on by the
                        Council.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Is that a revision?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major Johnson</hi>: Yes, slight rectification of both
                        areas.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: That is all on the list of the
                        Council for the treaty with Austria, sir.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: The rest of it is settled, is
                        that correct?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Doctor Scott</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: I mean, is it drafted up to that
                        point?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Doctor Scott</hi>: Yes. You called attention yesterday
                        at the Quai d’Orsay to the fact that a certain portion of the Treaty with
                        Austria had been given, and a certain portion reserved. It took some time
                        for the reserved portions to be given, because the details of the German
                        Treaty were apparently handled by the Supreme Council, and the Austrian
                        matters were set aside for the time being. Those supplementary matters have
                        all been completed; they have all been referred to the Drafting Committee,
                        and all been put in form, and I brought over, as a matter of interest, the
                        draft of the Austrian Treaty, which is completed from the first number to
                        374.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: What I was trying to get at
                        yesterday was whether the articles in the Austrian Treaty that never had
                        been delivered to Austria should not be delivered without waiting until we
                        had considered all their objections to the other articles.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Doctor Scott</hi>: That is a question of policy.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: I think so.</p>
                    <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0312"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: When is it proposed to give the whole
                        thing?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Doctor Scott</hi>: You will have to ask your neighbor, I
                        should think.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: I think it will be ready
                        tomorrow or the next day.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Doctor Scott</hi>: As far as the Drafting Committee is
                        concerned, it would be ready this evening. The only outstanding matter, with
                        which we are acquainted, that is delaying it, is the proposed change of
                        boundary lines between Hungary and Austria.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: That is the trouble, and I don’t
                        see any reason for holding up the whole treaty for that.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Doctor Scott</hi>: If that Committee does not report, I
                        should think a method of settling it would be to transmit the entire treaty
                        as it can be printed, either tomorrow or the next day, and calling attention
                        to the Austro-Hungarian frontier, and stating that there may be a subsequent
                        communication on the boundary line there.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: But that can be said to arise
                        from the notes that Austria submitted.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Doctor Scott</hi>: Exactly.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: And therefore I don’t see why
                        those other articles that never have been delivered should not be
                        delivered.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Doctor Scott</hi>: They are ready.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: That is the way I feel about
                        it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: Shall we put the delivery on the
                        agenda for the next meeting, sir?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Yes, let us get that point
                        settled.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: The delivery of the remainder?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Yes. There is no sense of
                        holding them up on that. They might just as well be working on that as
                        cooling their heels waiting for it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major Johnson</hi>: Have they decided on the form in
                        which they will present the clauses respecting the southern frontiers of
                        Austria assuming that the Italian-Jugo-Slav controversy remains unsettled
                        until afterwards?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: I don’t think we ought to go on,
                        but I think that is settled, that is, Austria renounces, without specifying
                        to whom.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Doctor Scott</hi>: Is that regarding Italy?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Well, it covers all that
                        southern boundary: Jugo-Slavia and Italy.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Doctor Scott</hi>: I would like to say that there are
                        four provisions in the Treaty as drafted bearing directly on that very
                        point, and they can all be summed up in the single statement that where a
                        boundary has been left to subsequent agreement, or there has not been a
                        present agreement contained in the treaty, that an obligation is imposed
                        upon Austria to recognize any disposition in accordance with the terms of
                        the treaty that may be made of this territory by the Principal Allied <pb
                            n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0313"/>and Associated Powers and the
                        Powers in particular interested, and that includes Italy, because you cannot
                        trace the boundaries of Jugo-Slavia without outlining the Italian boundary,
                        and there is no doubt about that—that is clearly done, and acceptable to all
                        the parties.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: That completes the Austrian Treaty
                        and the whole of the Hungarian Treaty.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: The Hungarian Treaty is not
                        touched yet?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Doctor Scott</hi>: Not quite true, Mr. Chairman. The
                        Drafting Committee has, in printed form, all of that part of that treaty
                        which might be considered of a general nature.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Yes. And then we have got the

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: I suppose it is almost the same

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel Grant</hi>: I should think so.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: That concludes Hungary.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hudson</hi>: The Minorities Clauses are to go into

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Who is in charge of that?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hudson</hi>: The Committee on New States. The
                        clauses will correspond to those in the Polish Treaty, which were also put
                        into the Austrian Treaty, and it is merely a matter of adaptation, which can
                        be done in a very short time.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Has that Committee been

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hudson</hi>: Yes, the Supreme Council requested them
                        to prepare clauses for the Austrian and Hungarian and Bulgarian treaties, in
                        addition to those of the New States.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: Then the Treaty with Bulgaria. “Note:
                        The main outstanding point in the Treaty with Bulgaria is the Southern

                        And that was referred to that special committee the other day.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: What?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: The Southern Boundary.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: We had better ask them why they
                        did not have a meeting. And that cuts them off entirely from the Aegean Sea,
                        doesn’t it?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Johnson</hi>: Well, it does, as recommended in the
                        report. I think there is a reservation by the American representatives
                        making that question of cutting off Bulgaria from the Aegean Sea dependent
                        upon the nature of the Constantinople state—the extent of it, really.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Of course it affects very
                        materially their economic life to cut them off from the Aegean. For
                        stability I am not at all sure that it is a good thing.</p>
                    <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0316"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Doctor Scott</hi>: There is that other question of
                        Dobrudja, the extent of territory in which you would have to get a search
                        warrant out for Rumania.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: I notice it was reported—whether
                        true or not, I don’t know—that Rumania had suggested to Bulgaria that she
                        furnish two divisions to help her fight the Bolshevists, and as a
                        consideration they would give them the southern portion of Dobrudja.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Bulgaria declined.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Lansing</hi>: Bulgaria declined. [<hi rend="italic"

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: But that matter of Dobrudja
                        ought to be pretty carefully studied. I don’t know what the economic
                        problems are in the Dobrudja.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Johnson</hi>: They are very small.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: But the ethnological problems
                        are very apparent.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Johnson</hi>: The Territorial Commission agreed to
                        the principle of restoration by Rumania to Bulgaria of a portion of the
                        Dobrudja, with the dissension of one of the French representatives; one gave
                        a dissenting opinion. The others were in agreement.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Where is that report?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Johnson</hi>: That is the report of the Commission

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: I think that ought to go on the

                        it doesn’t make any difference.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Of course in Hungary and in

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hudson</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: It is not a boundary, I mean; it

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hudson</hi>: Well, it will be a boundary part of the

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Part of the way it is a

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Johnson</hi>: Not in the case of Bulgaria.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: How about the mouth? No, that
                        runs through Rumania,—that is true—the Dobrudja. Well, it would make a

                        especially if they ceded it up to the Danube. I don’t suppose they will do
                        that. But as to the use of the Danube, couldn’t that go into the Hungarian
                        Treaty so that Rumania will be bound by it?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Johnson</hi>: I should think so.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: As to the use of the Danube.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: There ought to be some Article

                        territory, and that can be just as well inserted in some general clauses as
                        to the use of the Danube. Are all three of the mouths of the Danube
                        navigable, or only two?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hudson</hi>: There will be a separate treaty with

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Yes, a separate section.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: Are you working on that?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hudson</hi>: Yes, that is about ready.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Palmer</hi>: Is it expected the United States will
                        sign the treaty with Bulgaria?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: The President’s point of view is
                        that we are more or less guaranteeing this peace, and if we do, why we have
                        got to take part in the Treaty. I don’t quite know what we are really to do;
                        we have never made war with Bulgaria, and never even broke diplomatic
                        relations with her.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Palmer</hi>: In regard to the Economic Clauses, I
                        attended one or two meetings of the Commission discussing those subjects,
                        and I understood from the instructions at that time that we were to
                        participate in the meetings, but we are not to participate in the
                        Treaty.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: I think that was the first
                        view.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Palmer</hi>: We discussed a good many subjects with
                        which we are totally unfamiliar. I know nothing about Bulgaria and its
                        relations with its neighbors. Now some of the very long discussions that
                        came up were respecting the rights to railways which the Greeks had
                        interests in. Now I should not care to be bound by those discussions,
                        because it is a subject I don’t know anything about whatever. The only
                        remarks that the American delegates made were of a very general character,
                        such as that the rights of everybody should be protected, and things of that
                        kind, and I should hesitate to think that the United States delegates had
                        passed upon those topics with a view to signing the treaty. The treaty was
                        to be signed by the others who were to have the responsibility for the
                        adjustments, etc. It sounds all right on the surface, but I don’t feel like
                        saying that we <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0319"/>are bound by them
                        when we go to sign the Treaty. If we are going to sign the Treaty I think we
                        ought to study it from a different angle.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Well, I think we ought to study
                        it then from a different angle, because I think that is the President’s
                        disposition—to sign.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: What Mr. Palmer says could be said in
                        behalf of all of those who sat on the several commissions, some of whom are
                        not here now, because under the instructions we announced the general rule
                        that we took no part in the decisions.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Yes, that is right.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Palmer</hi>: It appears on the records.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: But I think it ought to be
                        carefully studied and a memorandum prepared, at least for our own use, in
                        the event that it comes up before the Council, as to the determination of
                        the question.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: Treaty with Turkey. As far as the
                        Supreme Council is concerned, the consideration has been postponed until it

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Yes, and of course that comes
                        after the Treaty with Germany.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: The Economic Commission is

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major Johnson</hi>: The Commission has taken up that

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major Johnson</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Well, how is it, Mr.

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Buckler</hi>: Nothing decided yet.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Has there been a commission on

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Buckler</hi>: No, I think Mr. Venizelos has rather
                        avoided any commissions. Nothing been decided.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: I think that can rest.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: The economic clauses have been
                        drafted, Mr. Secretary, along the lines of the other treaties, except the
                        disagreeable question of capitulation.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: But that all depends, doesn’t
                        it, or depends in very large measure, on whether it goes under mandates or
                        whether there is to be an independent Turkish state?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: Well, they proceeded on the
                        supposition that there was to be a certain Turkey which has been called
                        Turkey proper, but the really disagreeable question is as to capitulations,
                        as to whether it can be maintained, or extended even, as some have
                        proposed.</p>
                    <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0320"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: I think we will have to drop
                        that, except I think we ought to continue the study of it, and I think we
                        ought to study the boundaries. We don’t want a perfectly impoverished
                        Armenia, for example. That is a perfectly useless proposition. You might
                        just as well make the Sahara a state as to do that.</p>
                    <p>Well, has anybody any suggestions? Of course there is this that we want to
                        bear in mind, and that is the necessity, so far as possible, of cutting down
                        our personnel, but we don’t want to cut it down to where it is going to
                        materially impair our work at all, but it is quite essential on account of
                        the state of funds, that the personnel be cut down as much as possible.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: I want to ask one thing. What
                        treaties have we, the United States, got to negotiate directly with Germany?
                        Treaties of commerce?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: That will depend on the status of the
                        treaty that we want to maintain. Under certain of the Economic Clauses all
                        bilateral treaties are abrogated, with the right of any country to revive
                        such treaty as they want to revive. It has always been my supposition that
                        we would get rid of these separate German state treaties, and probably
                        revive those which we concluded with the Empire, avoiding all these
                        disagreeable questions.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: I think we have a consular
                        treaty with the Empire.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: But there are some of the
                        earlier commercial treaties that we have lived under, and I think our
                        extradition treaty is an early one too.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: Yes, the naturalization, commerce,
                        navigation and extradition are all with separate states.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>. Ought we not to negotiate new
                        treaties?</p>
                    <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0322"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: I don’t think there is any great hurry
                        about those things, because the economic clauses so perfectly protect our
                        commerce, leaving, of course, the matter of extradition, which is serious.
                        But, if I [may] make a suggestion, I think it would be advisable not to
                        revive any of the separate extradition treaties, because they are very
                        nasty, and they have given rise to disagreeable questions. I think our
                        naturalization and commerce are perfectly covered by the economic clauses. I
                        think an extradition treaty could be negotiated in a few months, and I think
                        that will be better than reviving.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: What form will the revival take?
                        A notification?</p>

                        effective on a certain date, and then give them a date.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: I suppose we had better have a
                        draft of the form as to the revival. Of course we have got to revive our

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Then let us build a new treaty
                        and get one signed. I think we ought to have a consular treaty. My belief is
                        to have, as far as possible, separate treaties on separate subjects, and not
                        include them in one big treaty.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: Mr. Secretary, there are a few
                        territorial questions still unsettled which I think were not mentioned. One
                        of the worst is Teschen. There is a divided Commission report on that
                        subject presented some months ago, and various things have happened since
                        that time which may perhaps render a new consideration in the Commission
                        desirable, if the Supreme Council should approve of that.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Well, will you be good enough to
                        prepare a memorandum on the status of that question, and what the needs are
                        in regard to the subject.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: I believe Mr. Dulles prepared a

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: I think you will remember, Mr. Secretary,
                        that the Council of Foreign Ministers referred it back to the Commission to
                        draft a project of autonomy. The project is being worked upon, but it is not
                        quite completed yet.</p>
                    <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0323"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: It was not a project of autonomy
                        in Eastern Galicia?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: With Poland?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: A project whereby Eastern Galicia should
                        be connected with Poland, while given a measure of autonomy, pending the
                        time when a consultation could be held.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Well, there was a very little
                        autonomy considered by the Council. I don’t know who put that in.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: Yes, it was to be a civil
                        government, with full guarantee of religious liberty; it was to be more or
                        less a form of government approved by the Council of the Allied and
                        Associated Powers.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Yes, it was to be a conditional
                        authority, to be conditioned on their protecting certain rights, but my
                        understanding was that Polish law should extend over Eastern Galicia. There
                        was to be no legislative body to make laws in Eastern Galicia.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: I believe the word “autonomy” was used in
                        the resolution of the Council of Foreign Ministers.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: The establishment of civil
                        government was specifically provided for in the resolution, Authorized to
                        establish a civil government.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: Yes that was quite right, and to
                        employ as many Galicians as possible in that government. The point was that
                        you would have to have an entirely separate legislature, with an interallied
                        commissioner at the head, in the event that they were separated in any way
                        from Poland, but that the Polish law would extend over the territory in
                        order that the courts and the government might be, just as the military
                        were, under the Polish authority, and that ultimately they would have the
                        opportunity to determine their own allegiance.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: And then one other question connected
                        with Poland is the eastern frontier with Russia. Some months ago the British
                        were very eager to get that question settled as quickly as possible, and had
                        it presented to a Polish Commission, who presented a report on it, which has
                        never been acted upon.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: That was in the neighborhood of
                        the Lithuanian corner?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary Lansing</hi>: As I remember it the French were
                        the people that wanted something to do with that. It is so long ago that I

                    <p>Mr. Lansing suggested that General Summerall should obtain the information
                        which Admiral Knapp received from Admiral Andrews and directed Mr. Harrison
                        to see that the General received all the papers in the case.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners requested General Summerall to keep them advised by
                        telegraph of the results of his investigation which it was thought he would
                        have no difficulty in doing through the Navy wireless, as there was already
                        an American destroyer at Fiume and it would not be long before the cruiser
                        already ordered there would arrive.</p>

                        Noyes, American Rhineland Commissioner, in which Mr. Noyes recommended that

                    <p>Before approving this expenditure, the Commissioners desired that it be
                        ascertained whether it would not be possible to secure some of the necessary
                        decorations, flags, etc. from the French Government. The Commissioners

                        Commissioners felt that it would be unwise to endeavor to retain any such
                        persons who might be found available from the army forces of the United
                        States in Europe, and that it would be impossible to attach any such persons
                        to the Commission, as there were no funds available for this purpose. <seg

                        the availability of any army officers for commissions provided for in the

                    <p>I. Memorandum No. 466 containing a list of the various missions and
                        commissions now in existence was read.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners desired to be furnished with copies of this memorandum so
                        that they might have an opportunity of studying this data with a view to
                        cutting down unnecessary expense. <seg type="margin">Field Missions and

                    <p>Generally speaking the Commissioners were inclined to believe that it would
                        be necessary to continue the Rhineland Commission, Mission to Turkey, the
                        Teschen Commission, Klagenfurt Mission, Halstead Mission, Dyar Mission,
                        Summerall Mission and the Polish Mission. General Bliss has now under
                        consideration the revision of the Mission to the Baltic Provinces. The
                        Commissioners felt that the Mission to Southern Russia might be dispensed
                        with and that the Mission [<hi rend="italic">Commission?</hi>] rely on the
                        information from the American Consul in that region, as this would be
                        sufficient for all practical purposes.</p>
                    <p>II. Memorandum No. 467 was read. The Commissioners disapproved making the
                        advance in question pending a decision regarding the necessity for
                        continuing the Field Mission to Southern Russia. (See Item I above.) <seg

                        Mission to Poland was read. The Commissioners hesitated to approve Mr.
                        Morgenthau’s request in view of the large expense that would be entailed
                        thereby, and desired to discuss the matter to-morrow, Sunday, afternoon at
                        6:30 P.M. with General Jadwin in Mr. White’s office. <seg type="margin"

                    <p>The Commissioners desired to be furnished with a brief memorandum regarding
                        each of the officers already assigned to the Polish Mission and those whose
                        names were now proposed, showing the <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0332"
                        />duties to which each man will be assigned and his qualifications
                        therefor.</p>
                    <p>V. Mr. Harrison stated that he had received inquiry by telephone of Mr.
                        Sterling of the American Embassy asking for the opinion of the Mission as to
                        whether the Embassy should deliver to the Azerbadjian Peace Delegation in
                        Paris the sum of 1,000 pounds sterling which the Embassy had received from
                        the American Consul at Tiflis. <seg type="margin">Delivery of 1000 Pounds
                            Sterling to the Azerbadjian Delegation</seg></p>
                    <p>The Commissioners felt that the American Consul at Tiflis had been remiss for
                        accepting this money for transmission and believed that it would be
                        undesirable for the Embassy to deliver the money to the Azerbadjian Peace
                        Delegation. If the money had been received by draft this might be returned
                        to the Consul or the Embassy might send the money to the Secretary General
                        of the Peace Conference with a statement to the effect that the disposition
                        of this money seemed to be a matter for the decision of the Allied and
                        Associated Governments.</p>
                    <p>VI. Memorandum No. 470 regarding the proposed withdrawal of the detachment of
                        the American soldiers now in Vienna to help in the enforcement of the
                        Blockade against Hungary was read. <seg type="margin">Withdrawal of

                    <p>The Commissioners believed that the detachment should be withdrawn and
                        approved the recommendations set forth in the memorandum.</p>
                    <p>VII. Two memoranda addressed to the Commissioners by Captain Hornbeck
                        requesting that they permit Mr. Beer to leave for the United States on or
                        about August 1 and Captain Hornbeck on or about July 25 were read. <seg
                            type="margin">Release of Mr. George Louis Beer and Captain Stanley K.
                            Hornbeck From the Commission</seg></p>
                    <p>The Commissioners regretted that for the time being they were not in a
                        position to grant the request for release of these two gentlemen.</p>
                    <p>VIII. The attention of the Commissioners was invited to the fact that there
                        was no record of the President having approved the recommendation contained
                        in Mr. Lansing’s letter of June 13 for the appointment of Brigadier General
                        John H. Rice on the Commission to examine the Draft Convention on the Arms
                        Traffic submitted by the British and French Governments. <seg type="margin"

                    <p>I. Memorandum No. 471 recommending the designation of Mr. Herbert Putnam,
                        Librarian of Congress, as special librarian to the American Commission to
                        Negotiate Peace, was read. <seg type="margin">Mr. Putnam Designated Special

                        General so to inform Mr. Putnam.</p>
                    <p>II. Memorandum No. 472 regarding an inquiry addressed to the Secretary
                        General by Mr. J. B. Brown, inquiring whether or not the United States is to
                        be a party to and bound by the Treaties to be signed with Bulgaria and
                        Turkey, was read. <seg type="margin">Signature by the United States of Peace
                            Treaties With Bulgaria and Turkey</seg></p>
                    <p>The Commissioners desired that a telegram be sent to the President stating
                        that this question had been put to them by one of the technical advisers,
                        and that they had referred to the President’s statement made to the Press
                        before his departure, to the effect that the United States would sign the
                        Treaties with Bulgaria and Turkey, and that, consequently, the United States
                        would be bound by these Treaties. The Commissioners thought it well that the
                        President should also be informed that our experts had stated that if the
                        United States were not to guarantee these Treaties, the position which they
                        would take in drawing up the terms of the Treaty might perhaps be different.
                        The President should be asked whether the Commissioners’ action in the
                        matter had his approval.</p>
                    <p>III. Memorandum submitted by Mr. Tyler, dated July 12th, containing certain
                        information regarding the Austrian Delegation, was read, and the contents

                                advise the Liquidation Commission on such matters. The sale of
                                public of the United States left in France by the Army is prescribed
                                in a law of Congress. If the sales in question can properly be made

                                    xml:id="d111fn10">Of Colonel Greene’s memorandum.</note> there
                                is noted a reference to the ‘British Military Mission’. It is
                                believed association with this British Military Mission has given a
                                natural, but wrong impression as to the character of the American
                                Commission in the Baltic Provinces. The British Military Mission was
                                sent out by the British <hi rend="underline">Government</hi> and not
                                by the British Peace Delegation in Paris. It is a governmental
                                agency and may exercise such powers and perform, such functions as
                                    <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0335"/>its government may
                                assign to it. The case is entirely different with the American
                                Commission. The natural misunderstanding as to the powers and duties
                                of the members of the American Commission must be the explanation of
                                the statement in the footnote at the bottom of Colonel Greene’s
                                memorandum, and which is to the effect that Colonel Dawley is now,
                                as Colonel Greene understands, acting as Military Governor of Riga.
                                I am obliged to invite the attention of the American Delegation to
                                this extraordinary fact, because I very much fear that it may lead
                                to the War Department directing the withdrawal of all army officers
                                of this Commission. The American Peace Delegation is now in the
                                embarrassing position of having an officer, who was sent at its
                                request to collect certain information, acting as Military Governor
                                of a foreign city belonging to a country with which we have never
                                been at war and acting under the orders of a foreign general. In his
                                capacity as Military Governor he may at any moment be obliged to
                                resort to measures resulting in the loss of many lives. I think that
                                the American Peace Delegation would be in an indefensible position
                                were it to become known that an officer attached to it may be
                                occupying the position which Colonel Greene thinks it possible that
                                Colonel Dawley is now occupying. I urgently recommend that this
                                Delegation immediately, in writing, direct Colonel Greene to
                                immediately communicate with Colonel Dawley and should he actually
                                be performing the functions of Military Governor of Riga, that he be
                                ordered to immediately surrender this position and return to his
                                proper functions.”</p>

                    <p>VI. The Commissioners heard Mr. Homer Johnson regarding Mr. Morgenthau’s
                        request for additional personnel to be assigned to his mission, as stated in
                        Memorandum No. 469 of July 11th. <seg type="margin">Additional Personnel for
                            Mr. Morgenthau’s mission to Poland</seg></p>
                    <p>Mr. Johnson pointed out that the list given in Memorandum No. 469 was not
                        up-to-date. The correct list was that given in Major Otto’s letter of July
                        11th. He would point out, however, that Mr. H. C. Jacquith was coming back
                        to Paris, that 1st Sergeant John P. Lawton might be stricken off the list as
                        he had not gone with the automobiles to Warsaw, and that three of the six
                        remaining chauffeurs would return to Paris as soon as the cars had been
                        delivered in Warsaw. Mr. Booth was also coming back to Paris.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Johnson felt that all the remaining personnel mentioned in Major Otto’s
                        letter of July 11th were necessary, with the possible exception of Captain
                        G. C. Stefaniak and Second Lieutenant W. S. Gunbeck. These men, however,
                        were both fine types of Americans, and both came from a part of the country
                        where the population was very mixed, realized the difficulties to be faced,
                        and knew how the problem had been solved in the United States. Mr. Johnson
                        felt that the Mission needed just such a steady American flavor.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Johnson also stated that if he were unable to obtain the services of
                        Captain George Gordon, he would like to employ Mr. Tyng.</p>
                    <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0336"/>
                    <p>After talking the matter over somewhat further with Mr. Johnson, the
                        Commissioners approved the list as given in Major Otto’s letter of July
                        11th, with the exception of 1st Sergeant John P. Lawton, whose services were
                        not desired. The Commissioners also approved of the confirmation of the
                        assignment of Lieutenant Colonel M. C. Bryant, who had already left for
                        Poland, and whose name did not appear in Major Otto’s letter.</p>
                    <p>VII. General Bliss introduced Brigadier General Sladen, whom the
                        Commissioners had appointed as American representative on the Inter-allied
                        Mission to Schleswig. <seg type="margin">Brig. Gen Sladen, American
                            Representative on the Inter-allied Mission to Schleswig</seg></p>
                    <p>The Commissioners suggested that General Sladen should see the Secretary
                        General, from whom he should obtain his letter of appointment, instructions,
                        and any information which he might desire. The Commissioners stated that
                        they would be glad to receive General Sladen tomorrow morning if he were
                        ready, but certainly sometime before his departure.</p>
                    <p>VIII. M. Hymans and the Comte de Gruin (?) were received by the
                        Commissioners. M. Hymans explained that he had come before his departure to
                        ask that the American Delegation give its approval to the proposed
                        convention between Belgium and Great Britain relating to German East Africa,
                        which was to be considered at the meeting of the Commission on Mandates on
                        the 17th instant. This convention had been negotiated between Lord Milner
                        and M. Orts. The part of German East Africa to be assigned under the
                        convention to Belgium was less large than the part that Belgian troops had
                        occupied and administered for the last three years. M. Hymans was pleased to
                        state that the way in which Belgium had administered this territory had
                        given the greatest satisfaction to the natives, as he was prepared to prove
                        by the submission of various documents. He hoped that the American
                        Commissioners would examine this question favorably, as he considered it to
                        be of the greatest importance to his country. He explained further that this
                        convention was known to Colonel House, the American member of the Commission
                        on Mandates, who had sat in when the agreement between France and Great
                        Britain on the Togo and the Cameroons had been approved. M. Hymans was
                        leaving this evening for Brussels, and during his absence the Comte de Gruin
                        would have charge of the matter on his behalf. <seg type="margin">Proposal
                            Convention Betweeen Belgium and Great Britain Relating to German East
                            Africa</seg></p>
                    <p>Mr. White informed M. Hymans that the American Commissioners had no feeling
                        of antagonism to any arrangement between Belgium and Great Britain.
                        Nevertheless, there was the question of American participation in such
                        matters before the treaty had been ratified on the part of the United
                        States.</p>
                    <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0337"/>
                    <p>M. Hymans stated that the Council of the Principal Allied and Associated
                        Powers had referred the general question of mandates and this matter to a
                        special commission set up for the purpose before the Treaty with Germany was
                        signed. He again expressed the hope that the American Delegates would see
                        their way to give the matter favorable consideration, as it was of great
                        importance to Belgium.</p>

                        resignation, but in view of the strong recommendations Mr. Burden had

                        thought it desirable that a successor be appointed to General Patrick on the

                        of the approval of the draft convention submitted by the Aeronautical
                        Commission was now in the hands of Mr. Lansing who had undertaken to let the

                        was last week; it has everything completed as far as material has been
                        handed to it. There are three outstanding things—two of them are on your
                        agenda for this afternoon: one is the question of the railroad—</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Is that the Sudbahn?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Yes. And that is on the agenda for this
                        afternoon. The other is in regard to the slight rectification of the
                        boundary, which was settled, but the text of which will come to the Drafting
                        Committee this afternoon. And there is one thing that may affect the Treaty
                        one way or the other in the matter of protection of minorities: There will
                        be a slight change made in the original Austrian Draft.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: I made three efforts yesterday to get
                        the Reparation, Financial and Air Clauses sent at once to the Austrians, and
                        they kept saying: “Well, we will have the whole thing ready by tomorrow.”
                        That was the answer.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: If, sir, you can get your decisions on
                        those matters into the hands of the Drafting Committee this afternoon, those
                        three outstanding matters, that can go to press tonight, and the Treaty
                        itself—it is all in type—can be delivered before the end of the week.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: I understood there was a new Italian
                        proposition.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: There has been an Italian proposition
                        looking to the conveyance from Austria-Hungary of certain rights and
                        concessions that Austria-Hungary had in Tien-Tsin, but I understand that has
                        been positively negatived.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: I turned that down.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: I understand, Mr. Commissioner, that
                        there is a communication on Ports and Waterways. Mr. Hudson would know about
                        that.</p>
                    <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0339"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hudson</hi>: None from the Ports and Waterways
                        Commission.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: That may be advance information that
                        some of the members have such a thing in contemplation.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Capt. Hornbeck</hi>: That is in regard to the railroad
                        running from Trieste to Vienna.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: I could not say what it is. I have not
                        seen the text.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: You had your meeting this morning?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Captain Hornbeck</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: What happened?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Capt. Hornbeck</hi>: That matter was entirely disposed
                        of. That is the Tien-Tsin concession mentioned a moment ago. The committee
                        recommended that it make certain suggestions, but as far as the Austrian
                        Treaty is concerned, that is entirely disposed of.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: That is one thing. The Sudbahn is
                        another. And the other is what?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Protection of minorities.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: And both of them are coming up this
                        afternoon.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: And if those can be gotten out of the
                        way, there is no clause, as far as I understand, that needs to be added to
                        the Treaty to make it complete, inasmuch as the text of the boundary matter
                        is complete.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major Johnson</hi>: The proposition in regard to the
                        railroad involves territorial matters indirectly, and that ought to be
                        looked into carefully, because there was a proposition from the Italians in
                        connection with the railroad to assure them transit from Austrian to Italian
                        territory without any interference; “unhampered communication” are the
                        words; the meaning intended to be conveyed was: without having to cross the
                        territory of another country. And that matter was brought up in connection
                        with the territorial matters. It was acknowledged in principle in the
                        meeting of the Supreme Council, but with the definite statement on the part
                        of Mr. Balfour when he said “unhampered” that he wanted it clearly
                        understood that it involved nothing in regard to territorial matters.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: I wish to call your attention to the
                        fact that this is the skeleton copy of the Treaty with Bulgaria, and I was
                        thinking, if you did not have anything that you consider more worthy of
                        attention, it would be desirable if each one of those items should be
                        submitted to the meeting with a request for a statement as to the progress
                        of the work in each one of those sections, so that we could facilitate the
                        progress in that way.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Do you mean to ask now, in this
                        meeting?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Yes. Or would you like me to read
                        it?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: The outline of the Treaty with Bulgaria
                        is fashioned upon the Treaties with Germany and with Austria-Hungary,
                        consisting <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0340"/>of the Preamble, the
                        names of the plenipotentiaries—and, in that connection, who are to be the
                        American plenipotentiaries to sign the Treaty? In the case of the Austrian
                        Treaty, sir, whom do you wish?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: I don’t know whether Colonel House is
                        going to sign it or not. Do you mean to put that in?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: I had that in mind. Mr. Lansing’s name
                        will not be there nor the President’s.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: No.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Is it your pleasure that Colonel House
                        remain?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: We will telegraph him. Before it is
                        printed we will know.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: And then the first part of the Treaty
                        with Bulgaria is to be the Pact.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: There was considerable opposition on the
                        part of Great Britain and France as to including the Pact in the Treaty with
                        Bulgaria. The President informed the American members that it was to appear,
                        and so it does. The second is: Frontiers of Bulgaria. Perhaps Mr. Johnson
                        can state the exact situation of the frontiers.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major Johnson</hi>: The matter has been referred to the
                        Commission which is working on it now. The Commission found itself
                        confronted with diversity of opinion, the Italian and American delegations
                        maintaining that the territory ceded to Bulgaria in 1913 giving her access
                        to the sea should not be taken from her. The French, British and Japanese
                        agree in taking this territory from Bulgaria and annexing it to Greece. The
                        result was that it was deemed desirable for this Territorial Commission to
                        refer to the Supreme Council the general question involved in order that the
                        principle may be decided before we proceed to the discussion of the details
                        of the frontiers. The Greeks have asked for a certain rectification of the
                        frontiers decided upon by the Committee on Greek Affairs, but it was found
                        impossible to deal with those minor rectifications so long as we were
                        unaware what action would be taken by the Supreme Council. The thing comes
                        up tomorrow at 11 o’clock again for the final preparation of the report to
                        the Supreme Council, and immediately thereafter it goes to the Supreme
                        Council for their decision as to whether or not Bulgaria is to have access
                        to the sea. When that is disposed of, then the matter will be very quickly
                        arranged.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Bulgaria is in actual possession?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major Johnson</hi>: Bulgaria is in actual possession,
                        and has been since 1913.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Mr. Chairman, the next part of the
                        Treaty consists of the political clauses. Those are of very general nature,
                        and are based upon those of the German Treaty and the Austrian Treaty. Of
                            <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0341"/>course the protection of
                        minorities will be handled by the Committee with that.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hudson</hi>: I have discovered that the Council of
                        Four has not given the Committee on New States direction to draw clauses
                        dealing with the Bulgarian Treaty, and it will take action, if those clauses
                        are thought desirable.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: The next part, following in order,
                        consists of the military, naval and air clauses.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel Grant</hi>: They have never been taken up.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: They were prepared and submitted to the
                        Council for consideration.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel Grant</hi>: They were submitted before the
                        Council of Four broke up.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: A new proposition for military
                        clauses was suggested; it was referred to the military representatives, but
                        no final action has been taken.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: The next one, Mr. Chairman, is Prisoners
                        of War. The next is the question of sanctions or penalties. The Greeks, the
                        Serbs, the Croats, the Slovenes and the Rumanians presented a draft
                        modifying in principle and in practice the section in the German Treaty and
                        the one in the Austrian Treaty. Instead of the military commissions they
                        proposed an international tribunal. A proposition was laid before the
                        Commission, debated for a period of six weeks, and rejected by the Supreme
                        Council. Its fate probably will be the same either in the Commission or when
                        it reaches the Supreme Council.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: They brought it up in another form.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Originally. The proposition which they
                        are renewing was rejected.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: They brought it up in another form.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Yes, sir. That commission will report
                        very rapidly. Part 7 is Reparations.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. J. F. Dulles</hi>: The Separation Clauses have [<hi
                            rend="italic">had?</hi>] been practically agreed to three weeks ago by
                        the British, French and the Italians. Just before he left, Mr. Lansing (?)
                        instructed me to take an active part in the deliberations about reparations
                        and that resulted in discarding all the work that had been done. We have not
                        yet started a redraft of the clauses for the reason that the new British
                        delegate, who is Colonel Peel, while in personal sympathy with the views
                        which the American delegation proposed, does not feel himself in position to
                        discuss the matter yet because he has written Mr. Lloyd George asking
                        authority to modify the position taken previously by the British delegates.
                        He has not since heard from Mr. Lloyd George, and we are holding up the
                        meeting until he gets those instructions. We have discussed the matter
                        informally with the British and French, and if Colonel Peel gets Mr. Lloyd
                        George’s <pb n="306" xml:id="pg_306" facs="0342"/>approval it can probably
                        be concluded in a short time. In case he does not, we can get together on a
                        majority-minority report.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: The next part consists of Financial
                        Clauses.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Dulles</hi>: The Financial Clauses have been drawn
                        up and are in print, subject to modification, which will have to be made as

                        of the German and Austrian Treaties. I think you can see, Mr. Chairman, that
                        with a little acceleration of the pace, it will be only a few days until

                        work up to date, with the list of the conventions completed and handed in to
                        the Council.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: I would like to ask Major Scott if
                        he knows officially just where it is, and approximately how long we will be
                        waiting to take up the Turkish Treaty. I have understood that it was held up
                        until the President could find what the position of the United States would
                        be in the matter of taking of mandates. I don’t know.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: I haven’t any official information, only
                        there is a general understanding to that effect.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Buckler</hi>: There was circulated a little while
                        ago a resolution of the Big Four distinctly postponing it until the United
                        States will say what it will do about mandates.</p>
                    <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0343"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel Grant</hi>: It seems to me there is a hole in
                        that air proposition. As far as I know we have no one left who is on that
                        Commission. I don’t know whether Colonel Lippincott is looking after that or
                        not.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: Our representative on the former air
                        commission has gone home, but as far as the military importance of the air
                        terms is concerned, I don’t see why we need bother ourselves about it at
                        all. We will accept whatever is satisfactory to the Allies, because we have
                        no concern with it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel Grant</hi>: This particular section was not so
                        much the military air terms as the commercial aerial navigation.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: Doesn’t that all come in the air
                        convention that Mr. Lansing has taken home and refuses to take any action on
                        until that is passed upon?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: That is a separate and distinct
                        convention. This is a series of clauses of general nature, distinct from the
                        military on the one hand and international on the other.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Buckler</hi>: I ought to modify what I said just now
                        by saying that I know that Mr. Nielsen knows that certain sections of the
                        Turkish Treaty are being discussed just now.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: What action is going to be taken to
                        appoint men for the various commissions that are being formed? There are
                        commissions being formed all around the place by the other people, and I
                        want to know whether it is not best for our government to designate certain
                        men for places on those commissions who would be subsequently confirmed in
                        those commissions. It would seem necessary to have men so appointed, who can
                        familiarize themselves with the situation, and be ready to act later on.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: It was decided that we would not
                        appoint anybody until the Senate acted.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: Because of the present situation our
                        arrangement, in Silesia, for example, is breaking down. We have had a
                        convention with the Germans, Poles and Czechs, with an American at the head,
                        whom I selected, and with this new situation created by the Treaty, that
                        arrangement is breaking down.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Can we not get around it?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: My suggestion was that if we were going
                        to participate in Commissions that had to do with the plebiscite in Silesia,
                        that if Colonel Goodyear, who is there, can be appointed temporarily on that
                        Commission, it would give him a sufficient status to carry on.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: I can see that in respect to a good
                        many of these things it makes no difference if the United States is
                        represented on them or not. Take these Commissions of control in Germany.
                        The English and the French and the Italians can perfectly well accomplish
                        the whole matter of the determination of the surplus military material <pb
                            n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0344"/>over and above what is to be
                        allotted to them by the Treaty, and call for the delivery of the remainder
                        and dispose of it in the way in which the treaty requires.</p>
                    <p>Now with respect to that commission on plebiscite in Silesia, the President
                        told me that while we would participate in the study of the general
                        question, the authority of the commission and the approximate number of
                        people that ought to be on it, and their general functions, that we were not
                        to take any part whatever in the assignment of the number of American
                        delegates, and still less to attempt to make any designation.</p>
                    <p>But, in regard to commercial questions and trade questions, whereever they
                        are involved it seems to me that the President might take a different view
                        in regard to Commissions like that where our interests might be prejudiced
                        if we were not represented in the very beginning, even before the Treaty
                        went into effect, and if a telegram to the President could be prepared that
                        would make a distinction between these classes of commissions, I think he
                        might take a different view.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: I think we ought to send him one.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: That also applies to the Waterways
                        question, does it not?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hudson</hi>: Yes. May I ask whether the
                        Commissioners shall distinguish between the United States participating in
                        these questions as a signatory to the Treaty and as a power that is not yet
                        bound by the Treaty, but is asked by powers that are bound to come in?
                        Suppose a treaty goes into effect between Italy, England and France and
                        Germany, for instance, which calls for the appointment of an arbitrator by
                        the United States to do a certain thing. The United States might consent to
                        appoint that arbitrator, who can function without we ourselves being bound
                        by the treaty, and the United States would occupy the position that we would
                        occupy if Panama and Guatemala should make a treaty calling for an
                        arbitrator appointed by the United States. I wonder if on some such theory
                        as that we might be getting ready for some of this work?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: I should suggest we might.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: The meaning is to require the
                        designation of the individual.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hudson</hi>: I think it requires, as Mr. Hoover
                        said, that some man should be on the spot, ready, so that the moment the
                        situation justifies it he can begin to act.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: Yes, and he ought to be selected with
                        the assurance, both to him and to everybody else that he will be the man who
                        will eventually be selected permanently. Otherwise he will not take the
                        interest in the questions to be studied, which is quite natural, if he is
                        not sure he will be confirmed.</p>
                    <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0345"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: We ought to send a telegram today.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: Yes, and we ought to discuss its
                        contents with the gentlemen who are familiar with the situation.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Dulles</hi>: I am sitting on the Commission for the
                        execution of the treaty, and I have been considerably embarrassed as to what
                        position to take. If we do not take the necessary preliminary steps in
                        appointing these men, we will soon not have any left. The only way this can
                        be taken care of is to hold these men here, telling them that when the
                        treaty goes into force they will be appointed. Now, the treaty provides for
                        a number of Commissions, Boundary and Plebiscite, for example, which call
                        for an American, and further provide that the commissioners shall undertake
                        their duties either immediately upon the going into force of the treaty or
                        within fifteen days. In view of the unsettled conditions in Europe,
                        particularly in Poland and places of that sort, the Allies are very
                        insistent that there shall be no delay in getting the commissioners of
                        certain of these commissions on the spot. The presence of those
                        commissioners is essential to the maintenance of order; their presence is
                        necessary for the effect it will have.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, Germany has the right to ask that those commissioners
                        should not start to work without the presence of an American. The presence
                        of an American is, in a sense, an assurance to Germany (that is the way
                        Germany feels about it), that they will get fair treatment, and they are
                        entitled to that.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: Why should the Germans insist that
                        the Americans be there? The treaty might go into effect and we not take part
                        at all.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Dulles</hi>: It says: “The Allied and Associated
                        Powers” should draw a boundary, for instance.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Which it does in a number of cases. I
                        don’t think there is any danger of the Senate rescinding anything of that
                        sort, except as concerns the League of Nations. I think it might be
                        recommended that that distinction be made.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Dulles</hi>: I prepared this morning, General Bliss,
                        a memorandum covering this very point.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Will you and Mr. Hudson and Mr. Hoover
                        draw a telegram, however long, and we will send it at once.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hudson</hi>: Do you approve that distinction, Dr.
                        Scott?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: I think that is very just.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: There is no question that the Senate
                        will approve the treaty, except the League of Nations.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: I should like to ask Dr. Scott this
                        thing, as an expert on treaties: Suppose the treaty says that the Allied and
                        Associated Powers will do so and so, will appoint a plebiscite commission,
                        and so on,—as I understand it that is not at all the same as <pb n="310"
                            xml:id="pg_310" facs="0346"/>if it were to say: “The Five Principal
                        Powers” or the “Five Principal Allied and Associated Powers”, because in the
                        military clauses, where it says that the Allies shall furnish a force for
                        Upper Silesia—I think that is the wording of the Treaty—it does not say “An
                        Allied Force”—or possibly it does say “An Allied Force”, anyone of them
                        assigned to that duty will undertake it; we can send a British force or we
                        can send an American force, and nobody else can intervene. Consequently,
                        referring to what Mr. Dulles just said, that Germany could refuse to act if
                        Americans were not represented, I don’t see how they could take that
                        position. If it said “The Five Powers”, that would be one thing, but if it
                        said “The Allied and Associated Powers”, why if one member of the Allied and
                        Associated Powers whose signatures are necessary to put the Treaty into
                        effect, should act, that would be sufficient.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: I should say so, General, where the
                        obligation is general in its terms—“Allied and Associated Powers”. Where,
                        however, the Treaty is specific—“The Principal Allied and Associated
                        Powers”—naturally those who are to act are designated, and in the cases of
                        plebiscites, the Principal Allied and Associated Powers are those designated
                        to perform the obligation.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: And in certain cases of arbitration,
                        such as Mr. Hudson referred to.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hudson</hi>: We could act, although the United
                        States refuses to ratify the treaty.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Exactly as he has illustrated in the
                        case of a treaty between Panama and Guatemala. If they should agree that the
                        President of the United States should appoint an arbitrator, the President
                        of the United States would take advantage of such a provision of the treaty,
                        although there were no treaty obligation to do so.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Or he might decline it.</p>

                        what the other nations do with the old capitulations. I should say, perhaps,
                        that if we revise the old treaties, our League of Nations would derive a
                        benefit from it, but if they only carry rights, then a very disagreeable
                        situation might arise with Turkey. But if we sign we are in the same
                        position as the others.</p>
                    <p>The hitch seems to be now that the French want to proceed with rather an
                        elaborate scheme of reorganizing the judiciary. They will maintain the old
                        consular jurisdiction, but they will want to establish mixed courts. And I
                        should think that that matter will perhaps be taken away from the
                        Commission, and brought by the British up to the plenipotentiaries to be
                        decided, and that it will involve, perhaps, a considerable controversy, and
                        it seems to me that we are interested, whether we sign or not, in a
                        considerable degree, since we must protect our commercial interests there.
                        We must maintain our judicial functions, because we cannot let the rights of
                        our nationals be determined by Turkish courts.</p>

                        over Europe, and you are very largely dependent on it. These systems are
                        operated by American operators, and the lines have been leased to us by
                        various governments. Two-thirds of your telegrams come over the lines in
                        question, and if they are not continued you will find yourselves absolutely
                        cut off. I have got 250 telegraph operators, and my appropriation has run

                        to educate them in the work they will have to do. It will take sixty

                            Mr. James presented the following memorandum:</item>
                    </list>
                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Memorandum Concerning Possible Action at
                            Budapest</hi></p>
                    <p>There would seem to be two ways of loosening the knot at Budapest which now
                        ties up all normal communication in southeastern Europe. Both proceed on the
                        basis that Bela Kun’s Government cannot be taken at its word—that mere
                        promises by that Government cannot be accepted.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item><hi rend="italic">First</hi>. The Bela Kun Government can be upset by
                            force and another government may be set up under the auspices of an
                            Allied army of occupation with which treaties and engagements can be
                            made. This is military interference in the internal affairs of
                            Hungary.</item>
                        <item><hi rend="italic">Second</hi>. Another alternative is to proceed to
                            police the Danube River and the vital railway lines which pass through
                            Hungarian territory and which are essential to the normal economic life
                            of the surrounding countries which the Allies have already made immense
                            sacrifices to liberate. This need not involve the dictation of a form of
                            government to the people of Hungary and is susceptible of being handled
                            in such a manner that it will be rightly recognized by the public
                            opinion of the world as a police measure. It should be handled as just
                            such a police measure as the League of Nations is devised to countenance
                                <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0349"/>and encourage as an
                            alternative to warfare. To elaborate this alternative:</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The first step should be taken in the name of peaceful commerce. The
                        Interallied Danube River Commission, on which America, Great Britain, France
                        and Italy are the only countries now represented, has already been requested
                        by agents of the Bela Kun Government to arrange for the resumption of
                        traffic on the Danube. This Commission could open negotiations for the
                        resumption of traffic and could insist that in return for permitting the
                        Hungarian interest to trade by river and railway the following conditions
                        shall be accepted: <list>
                            <item><hi rend="italic">First</hi>. Assurances shall be [given?] that
                                railway traffic and navigation will be guaranteed uninterrupted
                                passage, such assurance to take the form of the admission of an
                                Allied police force to such parts of Budapest and such points on the
                                Hungarian railway and river systems as may seem necessary to
                                preserve order.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="italic">Second</hi>. Bela Kun shall immediately arrange
                                for the inclusion of a moderate element in his Government.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">If this is done it should be announced immediately that the
                        action does not imply political recognition to the Bela Kun Government, nor
                        even an attempt to interfere with the internal politics of Hungary.
                        Consistent with this action the people within the territory held by Bela
                        Kun’s Government will still be able to determine whether they will continue
                        to support his Government or to change it. In this manner, the way will be
                        opened for a moderate and peaceful change of government, if the people so
                        desire. This kind of change is greatly to be preferred to that change which
                        will ultimately occur by counter-revolution unless a police force is
                        introduced into Hungary soon. Should Bela Kun refuse compliance with this
                        program, the Allied High Command acting on the advice of Admiral Troubridge,
                        the Chairman of the Interallied Danube River Commission, and without further
                        reference to Paris should issue the necessary orders to such Allied or
                        Associated military forces as may now be in this territory to establish the
                        above outlined police protection of traffic and thus guarantee to
                        Czecho-Slovakia, Austria, Yugo-Slavia and Roumania direct communication and
                        through traffic which they need for their economic life, and of which they
                        are now deprived.</p>
                    <p>If it were decided to deal with the Budapest situation in this manner
                        something like the following procedure would have to be adopted. The Council
                        of Ten would announce that it was acting in view of the serious
                        embarrassment which the Hungarian situation causes to the neighboring
                        countries and to the efforts of the Allied and Associated Powers to assist
                        these countries to resume their normal economic life.</p>
                    <p>It would empower the Interallied Danube River Commission, acting through its
                        Chairman, Admiral Sir Ernest C. T. Troubridge, to offer to lift the blockade
                        of Hungary upon the condition above mentioned.</p>
                    <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0350"/>
                    <p>It would instruct the Commander of the <hi rend="italic">Armée de
                            l’Orient</hi> to supply such troops as may be required to guarantee safe
                        and uninterrupted passage to railway and river transport through Hungarian
                        territory including Budapest.</p>
                    <p>Such troops would be ordered to act under the command of a British or French
                        officer of general rank to be designated by the Allied High Command. So far
                        as the Danube River is concerned, such officer, if not Admiral Troubridge
                        shall act in close co-operation with Admiral Troubridge who shall be charged
                        with the special mission of securing traffic conditions on the Danube.</p>
                    <p>The forces detailed to this police work should be adequate to deal with local
                        disorders but should strictly limit their activity to securing transport and
                        communication for relief supplies and bona fide commercial traffic of any
                        nation or of the nationals of any nation, including Hungary. Except so far
                        as may be necessary to the performance of this police service, they shall
                        avoid interfering in any manner with local institutions or officials.</p>
                    <p>So long as this police service is not interrupted by armed Hungarian force,
                        no Roumanian, Czecho-Slovakian or Jugo-Slavian troops shall be employed in
                        this service.</p>
                    <p>In the event that this peaceful solution of the present reciprocal blockade
                        is opposed by armed Hungarian forces, the <hi rend="italic">Armée de
                            l’Orient</hi> should be instructed to take such measures as may be
                        necessary to occupy and police the river and railway communications passing
                        through Hungary, and in that event to impose all restrictions upon Hungarian
                        traffic as it may deem necessary to the reduction of resistance.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant Emory Pottle and Dr. E. Dana Durand were heard of [<hi

                        Mr. A. W. Dulles was also present.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant Pottle and Dr. Durand submitted the following memorandum:</p>
                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Memorandum Regarding Conditions in
                            Hungary</hi></p>
                    <p rend="center">Prepared by Lieut. Emory Pottle and E. Dana Durand of the
                        American Relief Administration</p>
                    <p>We visited Budapest during the three days July 6th to the 9th, and as the
                        first Americans holding official status, other than Captain Weiss, to visit
                        that city for more than a month, we consider it our duty to report the
                        conditions as we found them and to submit our views regarding the possible
                        methods of improving the situation.</p>
                    <p>Capt. Weiss is an American citizen and member of our army who was born in
                        Hungary and has spent a considerable part of his life <pb n="315"
                            xml:id="pg_315" facs="0351"/>there. He was interpreter and assistant to
                        the Coolidge Commission and since its departure from Budapest he has
                        continued to go there from time to time by automobile from Vienna and to
                        report to Capt. Gregory of the American Relief Administration and to Mr.
                        Halstead at Vienna. He was of the greatest assistance to us in our visit,
                        and the information which he furnished us supplemented that which we
                        obtained directly and confirmed it in every particular.</p>
                    <p>We interviewed during our stay at least twenty persons representing all
                        classes of society and all shades of opinion. Some of them came at our
                        invitation, but more of their own initiative, having learned in various ways
                        that we were in the city. They included labor leaders, members of the former
                        aristocracy and land owning classes, one of the leading former bankers,
                        Jewish merchants, professors of economics and other subjects in universities
                        and various others. Several representatives of the foreign press and of the
                        local press also contributed much information. For obvious reasons we
                        consider it preferable not to mention names in this memorandum.</p>
                    <p>We made it clear to those with whom we talked that we had no authority to
                        represent our government politically and did not know at all what plans were
                        contemplated by our Government or by the Allies. However, as it at once
                        became evident that the universal sentiment was in favor of some allied
                        intervention, we formulated various hypothetical methods of intervention
                        which we discussed with our visitors. As a result we found a large measure
                        of uniformity in their views as to the precise method which could be most
                        efficient and involve the least danger of bloodshed.</p>
                    <p>The leaders of certain of the labor unions desired to confer with us, but
                        decided that it was scarcely safe for them to do so. We were informed,
                        however, regarding their attitude by others who had talked with them.</p>
                    <p>We also had a long interview with Bela Kuhn. We naturally did not discuss
                        with him at all the subject of allied intervention, but sought rather to
                        ascertain his views as to what would happen in the absence of such
                        intervention.</p>
                    <p>Our conclusion as to the facts of the present situation were strengthened by
                        various items and editorials appearing in the Budapest papers, notably the
                            <hi rend="italic">Pester Lloyd</hi>. There is absolutely no freedom of
                        the press and the only newspapers are government organs which do not, of
                        course, represent public opinion of the majority or of the different
                        classes. Nevertheless they themselves reveal a great deal regarding the
                        desperateness of the situation and the conflict between different factions.
                        Walks and drives through the city also directly reveal a great deal.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Food and Economic Situation.</hi></p>
                    <p>The weakness of the present government, while it arises largely from
                        recognition of its unsound principles, and from resentment at the criminal
                        acts of many of its representatives, rest chiefly in the desperate economic
                        situation and the hardships due to lack of supplies of all sorts. This
                        economic situation, while partly attributable to the blockade and the
                        inability to obtain necessary products from outside, is just as much due to
                        internal disorganization of industry. The people have lost the desire to
                        work. The production even of those industries which have necessary materials
                        has fallen off greatly. Bela Kuhn is forced constantly to appeal for greater
                        production and for greater patience in enduring the openly-admitted
                        hardships. The coal production, partly by reason of the occupation of
                        important mining regions by the other national states, and partly because of
                        internal conditions, is exceedingly small and suffices barely to operate a
                        limited number of trains and to operate those factories which are engaged in
                        manufacturing munitions; the production even of munitions, we are informed,
                        is very small.</p>
                    <p>There is probably sufficient food in the country as a whole, but the peasants
                        are unwilling to give it up, both because of their opposition to the system
                        of government and because the Bolshevists’ money, with which they are paid,
                        is virtually worthless and there are no goods which the peasant desires on
                        which to spend it. A large part of the food supply of Budapest at present is
                        extorted from the peasants by sheer violence.</p>
                    <p>The result is that even for the favored adherents of the government life in
                        Budapest is one of very great hardship. Everyone gets a fair quantity of
                        poor bread. As regards other foods, so far as they exist at all, the cards
                        of the soldiers and munition workers and similar protégés of the government
                        are honored before those of other people and the latter get practically
                        nothing in the recognized distribution, though a few are fortunate enough to
                        get food by illicit trading, in which exchange of goods for goods has almost
                        superseded the use of money. There is a great shortage of fats even for the
                        most favored classes. Clothing, boots and shoes, and fuel, are scarcely
                        obtainable at all by anyone.</p>
                    <p>It is obvious that the conditions in these respects will become far worse
                        during the winter and everyone looks forward to a period of frightful
                        destitution. This foresight of the situation to come is one of the chief
                        reasons why the people want to change the government.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Unrepresentative Character of
                            Government.</hi></p>
                    <p>It must be perfectly clear that the present government is in no sense
                        democratic. It does not rest on the consent of a majority of the people, nor
                        even of a very considerable minority. It rests on armed force <pb n="317"
                            xml:id="pg_317" facs="0353"/>exclusively. While some of the leaders may
                        be actuated by idealistic motives the control has fallen into the hands of a
                        compact group of adventurers who seek only their own power and gain, but
                        who, because they are compact, have been so far able to hold down the
                        opposite element. It is useless for the entente to address itself to Bela
                        Kuhn’s government and tell it that it must reform itself. The opponents of
                        the government are in a state of moral lassitude and of abject fear. It is
                        useless for the entente to appeal to them to overthrow the government either
                        by peaceful or by violent methods unless it offers them the promise of
                        effective support.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Attitude of Bela Kuhn.</hi></p>
                    <p>We are unable to form a definite judgment as to the mental and moral
                        character of Bela Kuhn. If it be conceded that he has ideal motives and
                        believes that he is working for the benefit of the people, it is
                        nevertheless certain that he is powerless to control the violent and
                        self-seeking elements among his associates.</p>
                    <p>Bela Kuhn himself says that communism is an ideal which can be realized only
                        after a long period of education. To a large extent the present economic
                        system in Budapest is communistic, but Kuhn wishes to go back to a
                        socialistic system, a fact which is well worth bearing in mind considering
                        any reconstruction of the government, since a new government must inevitably
                        partake of a socialistic character. He has already caused arguments in favor
                        of socialism as against communism to be published, and is trying to initiate
                        some specific measures, such as trying to introduce virtually a wage system
                        according to what the worker produces instead of paying every one alike. The
                        trouble is that Bela Kuhn, even if sincere, is not going to be able to
                        effect these changes in the face of the armed power of the little clique of
                        adventurers. The only way in which any material change in present methods
                        can be effected, unless by Allied intervention, is by violent counter
                        revolution, and the prospects of the prompt success of such a counter
                        revolution are none too good. In fact, counter revolution is likely to mean
                        prolonged anarchy, continuous armed conflict between the different groups of
                        Reds and Whites.</p>

                        Classes.</hi></p>
                    <p>The majority of the working classes, especially of the more skilled, have
                        never favored such radical economic measures as are now in force, and have
                        become bitterly opposed to them in recent weeks because of the hardships
                        they have suffered. On the other hand, the great majority of these classes
                        are socialistic and it would be quite impossible to get their support for a
                        return to the old form of government and the old inequality in income. They
                        will insist on universal equal suffrage, the freest of political
                        institutions and a large measure of socialization of industry. Only fear
                        keeps them <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0354"/>from taking immediate
                        steps to overthrow the present government, and they will welcome any
                        intervention that will help them do so and support it with arms if
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>It is needless to mention the attitude of the former <hi rend="italic"
                            >bourgeoisie</hi> which constituted a very large factor in the
                        population and whose opposition to the present government is inconceivably
                        bitter. On the other hand we are convinced that most of them will take
                        fairly kindly to a regime acceptable to the working classes, and will not
                        attempt to intrigue in favor of a royalist regime.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Attitude of the Peasants.</hi></p>
                    <p>Before the war about two-thirds of the land of Hungary was owned and operated
                        by small peasants, the remainder being in large estates worked by hired
                        labor, the laborers, however, having small tracts assigned to them for their
                        family use, keeping a cow, pig, etc. The government has seized these large
                        estates and the already planted crops are being harvested by them
                        collectively. The land owning peasants are violently opposed to the present
                        government, partly because they fear that their land itself may ultimately
                        be taken away from them, but chiefly on immediately practical grounds. The
                        peasants think very little about systems of government at all, but they
                        object to having to sell their crops for worthless paper money or to being
                        absolutely robbed of them. Within the few days before we were in Budapest
                        there had been several massacres of peasants who had attempted to resist the
                        requisitioning of their supplies. Where such resistance arose the Terrorist
                        troops shot down many of the peasants, made prisoners of the people of
                        entire villages, condemned selected persons to be hung, levied huge money
                        fines on the people and carried off all of their grain and livestock. With
                        the slightest opportunity this class of peasants would rise as a mass. The
                        peasants on the large estates are said by most of our informants to feel
                        almost as hostile to the government, but Bela Kuhn himself claims to the
                        contrary, and says that he expects to be able to feed Budapest chiefly by
                        the products of the cooperative large estates, amounting to about six and
                        one half million joch (about ten million acres). There is no reason whatever
                        to anticipate that this class of peasants would lend any effective military
                        or political support to the present government in the event of a counter
                        revolution or of intervention by the Allies.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Army.</hi></p>
                    <p>The army consists of soldiers of three classes: first, a small minority who
                        are thoroughly Red, mostly mere adventurers and cutthroats; second, those
                        who have joined the army because of the pay and the food, since they find it
                        difficult to support themselves as well in any way; third, those who are
                        actuated by strictly nationalist motives and <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319"
                            facs="0355"/>who are willing to fight to preserve the sacred soil of
                        Hungary, and for no other motive.</p>
                    <p>The soldiers of the second and third classes, who are in the great majority,
                        would, if they dared, immediately either throw down their arms, or actually
                        attack the present government, provided they were assured that the territory
                        of Hungary was safe from further aggression. Boehm, the commander-in-chief
                        of the army, is himself, according to our best information, a moderate
                        socialist and opposed to the more violent element. He has recently issued a
                        proclamation against the Terrorist troops, who appear to be largely under
                        the control of one of the other peoples’ commissaries, a desperado by the
                        name of Samueli.</p>
                    <p>The general mobilization, which as indicated by dispatches was ordered by the
                        government a few weeks ago, was the result of discontent on the part of many
                        of the troops in the field. They asked why they should fight when others
                        stayed at home. The actual effect of the order in increasing the strength of
                        the army is almost nil; the mobilization is, for all practical purposes, on
                        paper only.</p>
                    <p>We are informed from credible sources that the munition works are producing
                        only two or three hundred rifles per week and one battery of field artillery
                        per week, and very little ammunition.</p>

                    <p>All elements in Budapest are united in disowning and despising the Szegedin
                        government, and insist that any participation of that government in an
                        attempt to overthrow the Bela Kuhn government would be a great mistake. It
                        is considered to represent essentially the old aristocratic and landlord
                        class, and can get no support from the working or middle classes.</p>

                            Intervention.</hi></p>
                    <p>The problem of Hungary is twofold; and on its solution depends not only the
                        welfare of the country itself, and all that that implies, but also the
                        welfare of the surrounding countries. An adjustment of this desperate
                        situation would have an immediate and salutary effect upon the vicious
                        Bolshevistic tendencies only too apparent in German-Austria, Bohemia, Italy
                        and various other localities. In this connection it is only necessary to
                        recall to your minds the unflagging efforts which the Hungarian Bolshevists
                        are making to propagate their cause throughout Europe. In fact, in
                        newspapers throughout Europe, even those not of socialist or Bolshevik
                        tendencies, much of the news that appears in regard to the present Hungarian
                        government is paid for out of that government’s pocket.</p>
                    <p>Entente intervention in Hungary must keep vividly in mind the fact that it
                        must proceed with the extremest tact and caution lest in attacking
                        Bolshevism it affront the national spirit, or in combating <pb n="320"
                            xml:id="pg_320" facs="0356"/>the national spirit it unite with it the
                        Bolshevist forces. From what has been said above it is clear that the great
                        majority of the people of Hungary are eager to overthrow the present
                        government and to do away with Bolshevism, but they are not willing to go
                        back to the old regime of government, or to the gravely unjust distribution
                        of wealth and income which formerly existed.</p>
                    <p>However, as we have indicated, the people are neither morally, nor from the
                        military standpoint, able to overthrow the present government if left to
                        themselves. They need the moral and, in a small measure, the military
                        support of the Entente. The army is ready for defection and the working
                        classes are eager for a change. The farmers will not feed the Bolshevists
                        except under compulsion by armed force. So strong and universal is the
                        desire for allied intervention that there is not the slightest possibility,
                        in our opinion, of any armed opposition to a properly constituted allied
                        movement. Bela Kuhn himself would not dare to give orders to shoot at allied
                        forces who entered the country under proper declaration of purpose. If he
                        gave such orders it is extremely doubtful if they would be executed,
                        especially in view of the attitude of Boehm.</p>
                    <p>It is impossible to overstate the undesirability of intervention which takes
                        the form of an advance by the troops of the countries surrounding Hungary.
                        Whatever might be proclaimed as to the purpose of such an advance, it would
                        immediately be construed by the masses of the Hungarian people as an
                        aggression designed to acquire and permanently hold more territory, and they
                        would regard it as the gravest offense to their national rights. Such a
                        movement would at once consolidate the army into a brave and effective
                        fighting force, and would rally all classes of people to the government, the
                        question of Bolshevism being at once sunk from mind.</p>
                    <p>We should like to call sharply to your attention the fact that the French are
                        hated, root and branch, in Hungary, this being in large measure due to the

                        affair and its echoes. The Italians are viewed with a hostility not equal to
                        that given to the French, but of a very definite character. On the other
                        hand, the popular nation in Hungary today is the American nation, followed
                        closely by the British. Therefore any display of entente force should be
                        composed, if possible, entirely of troops of these two nations. The British
                        and American flags, we are convinced, would be an open sesame to every
                        difficult door in Hungary.</p>

                    <p>The distribution of the manifest is absolutely imperative as a means of
                        securing the popular support for this intervention and preventing
                        misconstruction on the part of Bela Kuhn as to the Allied aims. More
                        important still, it will disarm the opposition to such intervention on the
                        part of the proletariat of the Allied nations.</p>
                    <p>The proposal that the troops shall come on monitors is partly based on the
                        greater speed with which they could thus be brought up, and partly on the
                        impressive effect of the monitors themselves and their ability for defense.
                        The monitors which came down the Danube at the time of the recent counter
                        revolution, being controlled by officers familiar with the river, were able
                        to avoid the mines. These same officers, who were Whites, will serve as
                        pilots for monitors bearing the Allied forces. It is practically certain
                        that no further mines have been laid as the one mine layer which the
                        Communists possessed has been destroyed.</p>
                    <p>If the sending of such a small body of troops is considered to involve too
                        great a military risk, a larger force could enter at the same time or as
                        soon thereafter as possible. It would be well, of course, to have Allied
                        troops massed at the border and to let it be clearly understood by the
                        Hungarian Government and the people that they were massed there ready to
                        march in and avenge any attack on the intervening forces.</p>
                    <p>We are able to suggest the names of leaders of different factions in Hungary
                        who could be called upon to join with Mr. Garami as a temporary
                        directorate.</p>

                    <p>I. The Commissioners desired to know what, if any, action had been taken with
                        a view to the delivery of the President’s message to the Emir Faisal.<note

                    <p>II. The Commissioners took note of a telegram from Mr. Halstead dated July
                        19, 1919, regarding the coal situation in Central Europe.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners thought it desirable that Mr. Hoover should be consulted in
                        the matter and that it might be well to send a recommendation to the
                        Department. <seg type="margin">Coal for Central Europe</seg></p>
                    <p>III. The Commissioners took note of a telegram from Mr. Halstead requesting
                        to be informed of their wishes as regards the new form of government to be
                        set up in Hungary.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners felt that Mr. Halstead should be instructed in a general
                        way that the United States was not considering changes in the Hungarian
                        Government. <seg type="margin">Changes in the Hungarian Government</seg></p>
                    <p>IV. Memorandum No. 489 regarding the continuation of the New York and Paris
                        Offices of the Committee on Public Information was read.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners did not feel that they were empowered to authorize the
                        Disbursing Officers in the State Department and here to continue the payment
                        of the sums necessary for the maintenance of the New York and Paris offices.
                        Consequently it would be desirable to refer the matter to the Department of
                        State by telegraph. For their part, <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0362"
                        />the Commissioners would be glad if the news service from the United States
                        could be continued as they found it very valuable. On the other hand, they
                        were uncertain as to the present necessity for maintaining the office in
                        Paris in view of the departure of Mr. Sweetser and so many of the American
                        Press Representatives, and the closing of the Press Room of the Commission.

                        submitted by the Secretary General to them for their consideration.</p>
                    <p>V. The Commissioners approved the recommendation contained in Memorandum No.
                        490, regarding the appointment of Dr. Manley O. Hudson on the Commission on
                        Ports, Waterways and Railways. <seg type="margin">Appointment of Dr. Manley

                        George Howe on the conditions as set forth by him in memorandum No. 491. In
                        view of the fact that Mr. Howe would not return to Teschen, the
                        Commissioners desired to learn from the Secretary General if it was
                        necessary to send someone to take his place and whom the Secretary General
                        would recommend for that purpose. <seg type="margin">Resignation of Mr.
                            George Howe</seg></p>
                    <p>VII. Memorandum No. 492 regarding the appointment of a successor to General
                        Patrick was read. The Commissioners desired that the matter be purused, and
                        in case General Patrick should have been appointed from Washington, that is
                        to say, by the Secretary of War, they recommended that a telegram should be
                        sent to the State Department advising them of the departure of General
                        Patrick and suggesting that the Secretary of War appoint a suitable officer,
                        not lower in rank than Colonel, to fill his place. The attention of the
                        Secretary of War might also be called to the fact that Colonel Gorrell, U.
                        S. A. seemed to be especially qualified for this duty as he had acted as
                        assistant to General Patrick in connection with his duties on the
                        Aeronautical Commission. <seg type="margin">Successor to General Patrick on

                    <p>III. The Commissioners approved the dispatch of a telegram to the State
                        Department regarding the acceptance by the Finnish Government of the
                        decision by the Peace Conference in regard to the Frontiers of Finland,

                        Colonel Warwick Greene recommending that Colonel Dawley and 2nd Lieutenant

                        regarding the continuance of Field Missions.</p>
                    <p>V. The Commissioners approved the draft telegram submitted with memorandum
                        No. 496 in reply to an inquiry from the State Department proposing a change
                        in the regulations so as to allow Germans in the United States to return to

                            provided that the status of the work on which he is now engaged

                            with Bulgaria) shall have been completed. As Mr. Polk was on a fast ship
                            and would probably reach Paris next Monday or Tuesday, Mr. Hudson might
                            find it possible in any case to delay his departure until Mr. Polk’s

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi> called the meeting to order. Mr. White
                        asked what the status of the Bulgarian Treaty was.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: There remain several clauses to be
                        passed upon by the Commission.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: But they are not to be drafted?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: No, sir.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. J. F. Dulles</hi>: There is one point I might bring
                        up, which is of possible interest to Mr. Hoover. The Supreme Economic
                        Council is still functioning. The Financial Section and the Section on
                        Germany are meeting, and they are putting all sorts of things on the agenda.
                        I don’t know whether they are necessary or not. It is not <pb n="330"
                            xml:id="pg_330" facs="0366"/>necessary that we attend, and I am not sure
                        but that we should definitely withdraw from all those bodies.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: I have tried on several occasions to
                        wind that up. The British are particularly obsessed with the idea of
                        continuing that body with all its ramifications, and any assault we make on
                        any minor part of it they take as an assault on the whole.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: What have you done?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: Various proposals have been taken up,
                        which we have not agreed upon. As far as the Economic body is concerned, we
                        have tried to transfer the questions on Germany over to the Reparations
                        Commission, because if it has any function it is a purely international
                        function, and we need to get rid of all those German relations. But they
                        hope to build out of that thing an elaborate piece of international
                        machinery for economic control, and I don’t think any American who has given
                        it any study is at all prepared to launch into it; but they are very anxious
                        to retain the machinery in its present form in order that it may mold the
                        character of it. I have felt that we will all go away one of these days, and
                        we would bid this thing good-bye.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Is there anything to prevent our doing
                        it?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: No.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. J. F. Dulles</hi>: When Mr. Davis went away he said
                        there would be nothing more to come up; that these financial matters would
                        all be closed, and we would not need a financial representative to attend
                        the meetings. But things are constantly being placed on the agenda whose
                        importance I do not know, and I have no time to go to these meetings, nor
                        have I anyone to send. But they are doing things the importance of which I
                        cannot judge.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: To which we are a party.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. J. F. Dulles</hi>: To which we are a party,
                        nominally. And not taking an active part, I cannot protect our interests, in
                        case they need protection. I don’t know just what to do about it, whether to
                        formally notify them that we are off the financial section and do not
                        consider ourselves bound by anything that occurs, or not. But that would do
                        what Mr. Hoover hoped we could avoid—having an open break.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: There is no middle course. You have to
                        go on.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: I don’t know. I think they ought to
                        send me the agenda, and if there is anything on it that is damaging to our
                        interests, we ought to go over. In the meantime we have called a meeting of
                        the Supreme Economic Council for next Friday, and I hope we can then finally
                        wind up a lot of things.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: You think we had better not break off
                        then?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: Well, I will send to the sections and
                        have them send around the agenda, and if there is anything damaging on it we
                        will <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0367"/>go. I haven’t time to run
                        around to many more sections than I am going to now. But it is foolishness—a
                        phantom in the air; it is the result of a situation where an official has an
                        occupation and hates to let go of it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: Do you see any reason for letting go
                        of it? It is better to wait for a while.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: I thought we ought to pull out if we
                        could. You would be in favor of waiting? (Addressing Mr. Hoover).</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: I think so. Well, we are all going to
                        go away some one of these days.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Major Johnson?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major Johnson</hi>: I think there is nothing of
                        particular importance. There are several minor frontier rectifications that
                        are being considered by the Rumanian and Yugo-Slav Committee, which will be
                        reported to the Supreme Council in a few days—none of them of considerable
                        importance. The matter in reference to the Bulgarian frontier you are
                        already acquainted with.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Yes. I understand that Mr. Venizelos
                        sent a telegram direct to the President.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: Have you seen a copy?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: No, I have not. Have you?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: Yes. I have one here.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: He feels very strongly on the matter.
                        Captain Hornbeck?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Captain Hornbeck</hi>: I have nothing, sir.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lt. Burden</hi>: I have nothing.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel Grant</hi>: There is one little point that is up
                        before the Council of Foreign Ministers. We were asked by the military
                        advisers at Versailles to assist them with a report they were working on for
                        the repatriation of the Czecho-Slovak troops, the question was whether it
                        was to be decided as policy that the allied troops should be taken out of
                        the north Russian ports before winter. The council has never paid any
                        attention to that inquiry, as far as I know. It has never been put on the
                        agenda. I don’t know whether that is really going to be necessary to answer
                        or not.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: I doubt it. Was that communication
                        sent to London? We returned the paper to the Supreme Council asking them to
                        find out from the British government officially whether that expedition
                        would remain or leave.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel Grant</hi>: Yes, sir. That was sent to the
                        Secretary-General of the Conference, and it was also sent by General
                        Sackville-West to England. I have never heard any reply from either.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: Well, all that makes it impossible
                        to carry out the plan, because we said at the time that if we began at once
                        it would be almost impossible then to execute it.</p>
                    <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0368"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Nothing can be done about that then.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: Besides that, we have official word
                        from Omsk that the Czecho-Slovaks would not attempt that movement via
                        Archangel.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Colonel</hi>] <hi
                            rend="smallcaps">Grant</hi>: That was, of course, a more or less
                        roundabout report. I think that came from the Czecho-Slovak government.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: It came from their diplomatic
                        representative.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: There is one incidental piece of news:
                        in the preliminary round between the Rumanians and Bela Kun, Bela Kun got
                        the best of it. That the Rumanians are in retreat.</p>
                    <p>We have a whole lot of ragged edges hanging around here. One is that same
                        question of Archangel. When the proposition was first taken up by the War
                        Trade Board, our Board participated in the feeding of the civilian
                        population at Archangel; when the troops were withdrawn, our interest in
                        that subject ceased. The British have put a little food in there, but they
                        say now that they will not put any more in there, and if they withdraw their
                        troops, that population will starve during the coming winter, and I
                        understand the British intend to withdraw before the winter, and they are
                        asking us, I understand, to stock up that place with food and do it at once.
                        It is going to cost ten to fifteen millions to do it, and we have no
                        available funds for anything of that kind.</p>
                    <p>And another ragged edge is this question of German and Austrian prisoners in
                        Siberia. The Austrians and the Hungarians both have been asked to contribute
                        something towards their repatriation. The Germans have refused to put up
                        anything for some reason or another, and in any event nobody is looking
                        after it. And it is a question in my mind as to whether or not it would not
                        be well for the Council to appoint a Commission, comprised of military
                        people probably, and this commission to say to Germany, Austria and Hungary
                        that we will undertake the repatriation of those prisoners for them provided
                        they find the money, and that the various governments should co-operate to
                        get them some shipment. But I don’t see that it ought necessarily to fall on
                        us to provide this, because to move 200,000 men from Vladivostok to Germany
                        would be a very large undertaking.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Are there many Germans?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: Half Germans and half Austrians. And
                        they are dying like flies because the people of Siberia won’t feed them.
                        They joined the Bolshevists up there one time, and of course Koltchak hasn’t
                        any use for them.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Dresel</hi>: I thought there was one German to five

                        200,000 Germans and Austrians. But I thought that if we put up a commission
                        and said to the governments: “Here is the commission that will carry out the
                        repatriation of these prisoners”, and have the governments <pb n="333"
                            xml:id="pg_333" facs="0369"/>co-operate in finding means of
                        transportation, this matter could be taken care of properly.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: I think that would be good.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Beer</hi>: The question was brought up a month or so
                        ago about drawing up a convention concerning the arms traffic and the liquor
                        traffic, but no one seems to know what the procedure is to be after the
                        conventions are drawn up. That the conventions should be signed here the
                        same time as the Austrian Treaty; but no decision has been taken. All we
                        know is that we have been instructed to draw up these conventions and report
                        to the Council of Five. But I think the matter of what ought to be done
                        after they are drawn up should be considered.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: The Council of Five should say.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Beer</hi>: Yes. The final articles about

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: They could not take it up until they get
                        the report.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Beer</hi>: Until they get the conventions
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Beer</hi>: No, I think they could discuss it in
                        advance, whether it should be signed later.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Would you like that brought up?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Beer</hi>: Yes, I think it would be of great
                        advantage to have it brought up and settled; otherwise it would take years
                        and years to get the parties to agree to these things.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: I think Mr. Lansing’s desire was that
                        as soon as Mr. Beer completed that work, to send it to the State Department,
                        and he will advise you.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Beer</hi>: I did not know what the plans were.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: Then it means that that is not to be
                        ratified at the time of the signing of the Austrian Treaty.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Beer</hi>: Of course there is a big disadvantage in
                        waiting.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: Why could not a clause be inserted
                        like the one in the aeronautical convention, namely that certain people
                        should sign, and there should be provision for others to sign later.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Beer</hi>: I presume that could be done.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: I presume that could be done. Do you see
                        any immediate objection?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Beer</hi>: No, I see no immediate objection. Of
                        course if every party acts that way it will cause very great delay, because
                        as soon as a conference like this stops—</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Can we Americans take action without our
                        government’s approval? Can we agree to a ratification of the same kind?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Beer</hi>: Of course those conventions would all be
                        subject to ratification. It is merely to what extent the signature would
                        bind them. It would have to be ratified now.</p>
                    <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0370"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: What is your recommendation?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Beer</hi>: I should like to talk that over with Mr.
                        Harrison, and find what Mr. Lansing’s desires are in the matter.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: In the first place you would have to
                        have special full powers.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: What?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: You would have to have special full
                        powers; the Department would have to give you special full powers to sign—or
                        to Mr. White to sign, because his full powers, as in the case of the
                        aeronautic convention, would not give him full powers to sign.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Perhaps it would be well for you and Mr.
                        Beer to talk it over.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: There are one or two things out of the
                        ordinary, one of which I presume I should have some instructions about, and
                        that is an agreement with regard to the disposition of Spitzbergen to
                        Norway. At Mr. Lansing’s request, we have a representative on the
                        Commission, which consists of representatives from Great Britain, France,
                        Italy and the United States. The idea was to settle, if possible, that old
                        question of Spitzbergen.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Norway wants it?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: Norway wants it, and it was Mr.
                        Lansing’s view that to concede sovereignty to Norway would be a good
                        disposal. I was delegated to a conference in 1914. We then tried to frame an
                        international administration, and that was, of course, a very fantastic
                        thing. The conference broke up when the war began.</p>
                    <p>All the delegates seem to favor this idea of conceding sovereignty in Norway.
                        For some reason the governments not represented here have been asked for
                        their views, and owing, perhaps, at least in a measure to the delay in the
                        mails, we have not received all the replies. The Norwegian minister here
                        made the proposal that the five Principal Allied and Associated Powers
                        should conclude a treaty with Norway, that is, the Five Powers on the one
                        hand and Norway on the other hand, conceding sovereignty in Norway, on
                        certain conditions, of course, with regard to guarantees of private
                        rights.</p>
                    <p>In 1914 our people had very material industrial concerns up there, which have
                        been since sold, so we really have no property up there, and we have always
                        disclaimed having any political interests, but I think, in view of the part
                        we took in trying to solve this rather disagreeable question in the past,
                        and in view of Mr. Lansing’s participation here, in going so far as to state
                        that he thought Norway should have sovereignty, perhaps we ought to continue
                        to take part.</p>
                    <p>The question is raised then again: if this idea of the treaty between the
                        Five Powers and Norway goes through, I ought to know how far I might go in
                        participating in the proceedings leading up to it. Again, <pb n="335"
                            xml:id="pg_335" facs="0371"/>the question might come up as to whether
                        our plenipotentiaries here would have power to sign such a treaty—which I
                        presume they have not—and we should have instructions from our government as
                        to whether they favor such a solution.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: There is no doubt they favor it. You
                        have no objection, Admiral, to Norway getting such sovereignty?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: Not at all.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: The only question I should say, is
                        whether in trying to facilitate a solution in the matter, which we now have
                        not much more than a sentimental interest in, we would be willing to enter
                        into a treaty to do it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Do you see any objection?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: No.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Do you see any objection? (Addressing
                        Dr. Scott)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: On the contrary, I would say it would be
                        a very good thing.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: On the other side: whether that is a
                        proper kind of a treaty. Norway thinks she can bring in line these five
                        powers, and France, in an unofficial way, so far, has said that after this
                        treaty is concluded she will invite the acquiescence of the other
                        governments. In other words, in getting the five powers to concede
                        sovereignty it would have a great influence in getting the others in
                        line.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: How about the small countries?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: Sweden has not replied. There has been
                        some foolish bitterness between Sweden and Norway. Russia—that part which
                        calls itself the Russian government here—seems to be falling in line. I do
                        not think that either the Netherlands or Sweden will object, and that being
                        the case, the coast will be clear for an agreement.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: I presume that we would have to ask for
                        instructions from the Department.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: For signing it, yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Of course you would participate in the
                        making of the treaty, but for signing you have to have full powers.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Would you ask, however, for power to
                        participate?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: No, I would not, because that has
                        already been directed</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Authority in regard to asking
                        sovereignty for Norway would not be necessary. It has not assumed the formal
                        treaty form yet. They are just discussing it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: I feel a little disagreeable in
                        working along with that plan, if, in the last moment, we should be

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Perhaps you might obtain it by cabling
                        and suggesting full powers in the event of a treaty; that would bring the

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: In his talk, Mr. Beer brought up the
                        question of Russia. Russian nationals have gone in there and have overlapped
                        some of the American claims. I don’t see how we can negotiate with any
                        better people than those who are here representing the Russian government.
                        They sent in a very remarkable document; not only is it remarkable because
                        of the historical facts it recites, but from a legal standpoint. These
                        people either have access to those archives up there, or they are in
                        communication with men who are very well versed in the situation. I don’t
                        see how we can postpone the thing until we find out what is the Russian
                        government; I don’t think that is an absolute obstacle. I can see how they
                        can make trouble, but that is a thing that will have to be met later.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: What objection occurs to you?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: It seems to me that our interests
                        are very much more remote than are those of some neutral powers that are
                        closer to Spitzbergen,—and for the Five Great Powers to set out to regulate
                        the world—that is the idea in my mind. I am speaking very crudely now.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: They are doing it. They are not setting
                        out to do it; they have been doing it all the time.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: You think that the assumption of power
                        outside the Peace Treaty would be a burden.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: I think you can take it up in a
                        telegram to Washington and that would take it out of our hands.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: I think, Mr. White, we could insist
                        that the treaty be so framed that it is merely a recognition on the part of
                        the five powers of the sovereignty, so we would say that as far as we are
                        concerned we recognize the sovereignty.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Will you draft a telegram, you and Dr.

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: With regard to Teschen: the delay
                        originally granted the Poles and the Czechs expires day after tomorrow, and
                        the French government has received a request, through its minister in
                        Warsaw, for a prolongation of the delay. That was considered this morning.
                        The American delegates, not knowing the question would come up, took the
                        position that they would oppose the delay unless they had some very good
                        assurance that if it were granted the two <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337"
                            facs="0373"/>parties could get together. This question has been delayed
                        and delayed, and Mr. Hoover knows through reports from that part of the
                        world, that it is interrupting the transportation of coal very much in the
                        district of Teschen.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: In that connection, Mr. Paderewski came
                        to see me the day he left and said that he had received notice from the
                        Conference that the time given within which he and Mr. Mazaryk were to come
                        to an agreement, would expire on the 25th. He said that when he went to
                        Prague, on his way back to Paris, he had had a talk with him, but they had
                        not been able to come to an agreement. They had thereupon each appointed
                        nine men to form a council of eighteen to discuss this matter, and he had
                        reason to believe that they had already met at Warsaw. I asked him as a
                        friend, and entirely confidentially, whether he considered that those
                        eighteen gentlemen would arrive at a conclusion by the 25th or anywheres
                        near it, and he was quite frank in saying that he did not. He therefore did
                        not wish to make any objection to the powers taking the matter up—to the
                        Council taking the matter up on the 25th, only he must beg that a plebiscite
                        be accorded to Teschen just as it had been to the rest of Silesia and on the
                        same conditions, and that everybody who had anything to do with it should
                        get out, and he said that the Allies and their numerous troops which they
                        had at their disposal, should come in. And there is where the matter rests.
                        I forget whether I reported that to the Council. I am not sure that I
                        did.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: Under an agreement we constituted a
                        commission up there with, I think, a German representative, and I think a
                        Czech and a Pole, with an American chairman. We got production up to a good
                        point, but now, since the Treaty has been signed, it is going to pieces.
                        Colonel Goodyear is coming down day after tomorrow, and I wish you would
                        discuss the matter with him.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: He has got some ideas on the subject,
                        having conducted the coal mines for several months.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: He has had success?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: Some success.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: Do you approve of hastening this,
                        after consultation with Colonel Goodyear, rather than having
                        postponements?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: I see no reason for delay, because if
                        the nine Poles elect any more representatives, and the Czechs do the same I
                        don’t think they will get anywhere. That Council of 18 really looked to me
                        like a Council of Chaos.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: One question in that regard, as well as
                        Silesia. The coal production is on the ebb now. There will be an economic
                        collapse if something isn’t done about the coal situation. As far as the
                        boundaries are concerned, that ought to be settled now. There are social,
                            <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0374"/>racial and religious questions
                        which are beyond the ability of any human soul to settle, but the boundaries
                        should be settled.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Dresel</hi>: Isn’t it necessary that we appoint an
                        expert who could handle all these questions?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: It is a terrible problem; Europe needs
                        at the present moment a total of 600,000,000 tons per annum, which is its
                        normal production. The total production is now down to 350,000,000 tons, or
                        something of that kind. And if we had a complete dictatorship of the whole
                        European coal production the production of Europe might be increased up to
                        say 500,000,000 tons, but even then I think they would have an economic
                        collapse. But I would hesitate about going into it, because I don’t see any
                        solution other than the whole thing reaching the bottom and going up again.
                        But outside of these social questions is the restriction of effort we have
                        got everywhere, and that is a thing I don’t believe anybody could solve. I
                        don’t see any daylight at all in the coal situation in Europe anywhere. So
                        that I feel if we monkey with this thing too long in an informal way, we are
                        likely to call down upon ourselves a good deal of blame, because we are
                        taking responsibility without any authority, and I don’t know that any
                        authority could be constituted that would remedy it. If someone possessed
                        all the food resources in the world and cold-bloodedly exchanged bread for
                        coal with each and every miner individually, I think he might solve the
                        situation, but I don’t see any other way of doing it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: May I ask a question about Bulgaria. I
                        understand there is an intention on the part of the commission to ascertain
                        formally if there is any doubt whether the American Commissioners should
                        sign the treaty with Bulgaria. Is there any information on that subject?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: We made inquiry about that and we
                        received a communication yesterday which sounded rather cryptic: that we
                        would not be responsible for the treaties with Bulgaria and Turkey.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major Johnson</hi>: He<note n="16" xml:id="d120fn16">i.
                            e., President Wilson.</note> said: we regard ourselves as bound by

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: He didn’t say whether we would be bound
                        by it or not. We can inquire about Bulgaria.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: I asked because there is some
                        uncertainty over at the Quai d’Orsay, and there is something of a feeling
                        that those who will not sign, who are not going to sign, should not
                        participate in the proceedings.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Well, we have participated thus far on
                        the assumption that we were going to sign, because I heard the President say
                        in this very room to the Press on the day that he went away, that we are to
                        sign the treaties with Bulgaria and Turkey.</p>
                    <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0375"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: He said it?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: He said it to the Press, and they were
                        on their word. But I don’t know whether he wants us to hold out as a
                        minority or not against all the others. As you know, England, France and
                        Japan support Greece; Italy goes with us. And I have asked my Japanese
                        colleague whether he had very strong feelings on the subject; I have sounded
                        him and he said he was bound to admit that he had not, except he felt that
                        the Bulgarians were the enemy and the Greeks friends, and therefore, if it
                        was a question at all it was reasonable that he should support his friend,
                        his ally, and not his enemy. But he admitted frankly that he had no feeling
                        on the subject. That discussion is coming up tomorrow.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: Do you know whether the President’s
                        health is likely to delay the answer?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: I am glad to say he is better. I notice
                        that he was up yesterday.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: Do you know whether anything has been
                        done about defining the eastern frontier for Poland?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: No, and that is likely to remain
                        indefinite on account of Russia.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: It materially affects this whole

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Yes. I am informed that the Rumanians
                        are about to hold an election in Bessarabia for members to the Rumanian
                        parliament. The representative of Bessarabia says that is a most infamous
                        proceeding.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: Did you see under what conditions
                        they were to vote?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: No.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: No one under forty is to have the

                        which seemed to be an ingenious way of giving a majority to the people in

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: There is this in the Koltchak
                        correspondence. Koltchak agreed to accept the decision of the Council.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Koltchak did?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: But Mr. Lansing’s position was that
                        nothing formerly belonging to Russia should be dealt with until Russia
                        should become a power again.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: But Koltchak was asked if he would

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: No, sir, but the Allied Powers in
                        their note to Russia took the ground that Koltchak had the right to decide
                        the Bessarabian question, and laid down as one of the conditions that
                        Koltchak acquiesce in what the Bessarabians should decide.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Dulles</hi>: I thought all those conditions were to
                        be accepted by the Russian government if recognized.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: Mr. Lansing inquired of Bratiano if
                        he were willing to take a plebiscite in Bessarabia, but Bratiano replied
                        that a plebiscite would not be possible under the circumstances, because it
                        would be a plebiscite on the question of Bolshevism.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: You would not go so far as to say that
                        the principle had been adopted in the Council?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: But that was our principle.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: That was our principle.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: And I told the Rumanians that I would
                        entirely concur.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major Johnson</hi>: Mr. Lansing said something to this
                        effect: “I don’t think I have authority to deal with such an act”, and I
                        remember Mr. Balfour said to him that he hoped he would get instructions
                        giving him the authority, because he thought it was a matter that ought to
                        be settled. The matter was left without any decision, indefinitely, as I
                        recall it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: I must find out whether that date was
                        not mentioned: August 5th, as to the election in Bessarabia. I thought they
                        were going to steal a march on us, as far as Bessarabia was concerned, by a
                        special election there.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: I think another question might come up
                        as to still another treaty. The Italian delegation presented a large batch
                        of so-called political clauses to a special committee on which I represented
                        Mr. Lansing, at his request. They wanted those clauses that related to Italy
                        and the new states, as well as Poland and those states that received new
                        territory, imposed on these new states. That I objected to on the ground
                        that these clauses related to purely local matters; that while the Allied
                        and Associated Powers were interested in broad questions growing out of the
                        dismemberment of Austria-Hungary, they were not concerned with such things
                        as coastwise trade and provincial duties and railroad rates; that those
                        matters should be settled between the interested states, and certainly
                        should not be settled without the interested states being given a hearing.
                        The British concurred in that view. And then the question was considered of
                        putting these clauses into the Austrian Treaty. Fortunately that Treaty was
                        closed for the insertion of other clauses. Then the assertion was made that
                        the Allied and Associated Powers conclude a treaty between the Allied Powers
                        on the one hand, and <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0378"/>the new states
                        on the other hand; and then there was the suggestion that these clauses be
                        considered generally as to their merits as clauses that might go into some
                        kind of a treaty, and we have gone over them, and that consideration I took
                        a part in. Now I made it very clear at the end that the American delegation
                        participated, but that it neither approved these articles in form nor in
                        substance, but it merely considered the question whether these questions
                        were proper articles to be laid before the new states as a basis for
                        negotiation. There was a good deal of effort made to make it appear that we
                        had done more than that; that in a sense we were committed to these. But I
                        presume that matter will come before you later, as to just what shall be
                        done with these articles, and I thought I would call your attention to a
                        little of the history of these matters. Certainly it would not be fair to
                        put in such clauses as these relating to the new states, into a treaty,
                        without the new states being heard—which seems to be the intention.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Any remarks to make on this? It seems
                        reasonable that the new states should be heard.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: I think this committee will just make
                        its report to the Supreme Council, and they will know the facts.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: I would like to ask Dr. Scott a
                        question about a matter that came to my attention today, and the decision of
                        which, I think, would have a bearing on the attitude that the American
                        delegation would be apt to take. The report which you showed me this
                        morning, Dr. Johnson, was a divided report on the question of the Bulgarian
                        southern boundary, and the attitude of the American and Italian delegations
                        was that the boundary should remain as in 1915, isn’t that right?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major Johnson</hi>: That is right.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: Reserving to the Allied and
                        Associated Powers the right to attach any part of this disputed territory to
                        the International State of Constantinople. The British, French and Japanese
                        stood for a cession by Bulgaria of this territory to the Allied and
                        Associated Powers. Now, as I understand it, in the first case the right of
                        the Allied and Associated Powers to attach any part of this to the
                        International State extends over an indefinite time in the future—either
                        ten, fifteen or twenty years, or longer.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: In none of the clauses is there a
                        limitation. They say sometime, if there is a plebiscite. It may be in a
                        certain time, but there is no limitation as to when it is to be held.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: Well, it designates cessions made
                        deliberately to the Allied and Associated Powers, I suppose with the idea
                        that they would themselves dispose of it very soon, but there is nothing to
                        indicate it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Not at all.</p>
                    <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0379"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: What would be the probable attitude
                        of the United States, or the United States Senate towards a treaty which
                        binds the United States in a continued association? We are an associated
                        power during the war against the Germans. How about our remaining associated
                        for an indefinite term to come? And for what purposes?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: I think Mr. White’s reply covers it.
                        There are a number of provisions in the treaties already negotiated to which
                        the United States is to be a party, in which we are associated with the four
                        other powers for the final disposition of this territory or territories, and
                        there is no limitation of any kind. It is a question of policy whether we
                        should undertake such an obligation, and that question of policy having been
                        settled, there would seem to be no limit.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: I don’t think it has been thought
                        of.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: The United States has taken cessions of
                        that kind in conjunction with the four other powers, and the cession is:
                        that Germany or Austria renounces its sovereignty or rights or title over
                        such and such territory, and agrees to recognize any disposition which the
                        Principal Allied and Associated Powers shall make of such territory. There
                        is no limitation as to time. The United States has agreed, apparently, to
                        become a trustee, with these other powers, of this territory, and in
                        co-operation with them to determine the question of ownership. This clause
                        would not differ from other clauses which are already in the treaty.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: I was told that Western Thrace would not
                        be given to Bulgaria, and also not be given to Greece, but to be held
                        subject to the decision of the Powers, in view of a possible mandate for
                        Turkey.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>. That is a question of policy, Mr. White.
                        Dr. Johnson could tell us something about that.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major Johnson</hi>: I should think it would be of a very
                        distinct advantage should it not be left with Bulgaria. Certainly from the
                        general political and economic point of view it would be very much better
                        for Bulgaria if it were under international control than in the hands of
                        Turkey. The Bulgarians would doubtless so regard it. In both cases—both in
                        the American-Italian proposition and in the French-British-Japanese
                        proposition—the power of control of that territory rests in the Allied and
                        Associated Powers, but there is a very distinct difference in the wording.
                        According to the proposal of the British, French and Japanese that the
                        Bulgarians cede the territory to the Allied and Associated Powers, that
                        prejudges the disposition of that territory to this extent: you would not
                        ask the Bulgarians to cede it if you were going to turn around and give it
                        to them. The Americans insisted that the frontiers of Bulgaria should remain
                        as they were in 1915, with the exception of any portions of <pb n="344"
                            xml:id="pg_344" facs="0380"/>territory which the Allied and Associated
                        Powers deem wise to attach to the International State.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: That takes it away from Greece at the
                        same time.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major Johnson</hi>: That takes it away from Greece, and
                        restricts the future attribution of the territory to the International State
                        if it does not go to Bulgaria.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: Owing to the previous
                        recommendation of the Greek Committee, if the Allied and Associated Powers
                        were not to keep it, according to the English and French view, then it would
                        go to Greece.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major Johnson</hi>: To the proposition that we might
                        simply draw the southern frontier of Bulgaria and leave the territory north
                        of it indefinitely, we replied that it would prejudge it, but would be glad
                        to have the statement whether, in view of the French and British it would
                        not prejudge the disposition, and the chairman was not willing to say that
                        it would not prejudge the disposition of the territory. For that reason we
                        were unable to accept that wording. We believe, and they admit that it does
                        prejudge the case, because we would not ask Bulgaria to cede it if we
                        intended to give it back to her. It would imply that it would go to someone
                        else.</p>

                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">conversation with mr. stettinius</hi></p>
                    <p>Mr. White stated that during a conversation the previous evening with Mr.
                        Tittoni, the latter had referred to the desire of the Italian Government to
                        secure a credit in the United States for $650,000,000 for three years. The
                        United States Government had put in a caveat that nothing must be done for
                        three weeks. The Italian Government was particularly anxious to obtain this
                        credit, as their needs are very pressing, and Mr. Tittoni inquired whether
                        the President would not consent to remove the veto on one-quarter of this
                        amount.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stettinius, in reply, stated that he thought that he might perhaps go
                        into the history of the matter. Some six weeks or two months ago Mr.
                            Crespi<note n="19" xml:id="d122fn19">Of the Italian delegation.</note>
                        had approached him on the subject of an American loan to Italy. At that time
                        Mr. Davison<note n="20" xml:id="d122fn20">Henry P. Davison, of J. P. Morgan
                            &amp; Co.</note> was considering most <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346"
                            facs="0382"/>tentatively the question of forming some plan or
                        corporation in the United States to handle the whole subject of European
                        credits. As he looked into the matter, he was soon convinced that government
                        support was necessary, and came to realize that nothing should be done in
                        any way whatsoever without government approval. He had endeavored at that
                        time to ascertain what the Italian requirements were, and had also asked the
                        British the same question, as well as the French, his purpose being to
                        present a statement of total requirements to American bankers.</p>
                    <p>As regards security for an Italian loan, the Italians had proposed that their
                        importers form consortiums, that the importers be held personally
                        responsible, that the drafts of the importers be guaranteed by these
                        consortiums or the Italian banks, and that the latter be then guaranteed by
                        the Italian Government. The Italians had approached the representatives of
                        our leading banks on this matter about June 22nd. On or about July 4th, Mr.
                        Stettinius had received a cable from Mr. Davison stating that American
                        exporters and bankers were not keen about the proposition, and there was
                        serious doubt in Mr. Stettinius’ mind whether the plan could be put
                        through.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stettinius stated that he had written Mr. Jung that no arrangements had
                        been worked out for Italian credit, and expressed the hope that Mr. Jung and
                        his associates would be able to make arrangements through their usual
                        channels. Last Friday or Saturday Mr. Springer, Governor of the Bank of
                        Italy, had referred to Mr. Stettinius’ letter to Jung, and had asked whether
                        it would not be possible for the big plan to take over any temporary
                        arrangements which might be made in the meanwhile. Mr. Stettinius had
                        replied that for his part he saw no objection, and thought that this might
                        be done, but laid stress on the fact that the whole matter was in abeyance.
                        There was, moreover, this difficulty, that American exporters were
                        accustomed to having the money paid them in the United States, and were not
                        used to giving long term credit, while American bankers seemed desirous of
                        carrying on their old arrangements. In addition, the United States Treasury
                        representatives in New York had been instructed to withhold action, possibly
                        on account of the fact that the President had in mind the issuance of a
                        general statement regarding the whole question of credits to Europe.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stettinius stated that he had seen the Italian Minister of Finance last
                        night, and that Mr. Schanzer had repeatedly asserted the urgent need of the
                        Italian Government to obtain money. In reply to a question he had stated
                        that it was for the purpose of purchasing food, particularly wheat, which
                        Mr. Stettinius understood Italy did not need. Mr. Schanzer had urged Mr.
                        Stettinius to help in obtaining the flotation of short term treasury bills.
                        Mr. Stettinius had replied that nothing could be done with private people
                        until the government had reviewed <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0383"
                        />the situation and had taken action. Mr. Schanzer stated that he was
                        proceeding to London to place 12,000,000 Pounds sterling of short term
                        notes, and that he wanted to place $100,000,000 worth in the United States.
                        Mr. Stettinius had advised him to talk with Hoover if he needed food
                        supplies. Mr. Schanzer had asked him to arrange a meeting for him with Mr.
                        Hoover, and this would take place this evening. Mr. Stettinius had spoken to
                        Mr. Hoover, and the latter stated that Italian food requirements were fully
                        covered.</p>
                    <p>In reply to a question by Mr. White regarding the financial situation in
                        France, Mr. Stettinius expressed the opinion that France was in a healthier
                        condition financially than any European country, with the exception of
                        Belgium. A group of young men had been formed here in France who were
                        courageous, intelligent and straight. They had friends in the government,
                        although they were not actually connected with the Government. Mr.
                        Stettinius had been much impressed by them. They had gone into the situation
                        very carefully, and had well-considered plans for bringing down the cost of
                        living. In his opinion, the principal requirement of France at this time was
                        coal. They seemed to think that they could get it in the United States, but
                        they had probably not realized the difficulties of moving it in the United
                        States, and the importance of having port facilities for shipment. Mr.
                        Stettinius estimated French requirements for financing exports from the
                        United States as from $700,000,000 to $1,000,000,000.</p>
                    <p>Mr. White then reverted to Mr. Tittoni’s statement to him the previous
                        evening, and asked Mr. Stettinius if it were correct that the Italian
                        proposals regarding terms had been accepted, and that the only thing that
                        stood in the way of the completion of the credit was the President’s
                        veto.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stettinius replied that Mr. Tittoni’s statement was quite incorrect, and
                        pointed out that all that had taken place so far was in the nature of
                        conversations of a most informal character. These had related to the
                        $100,000,000 short term treasury bills, not $150,000,000 as Mr. Tittoni had
                        stated. Moreover, the conversations were purely tentative, and it was
                        extremely doubtful whether the matter would go through at all.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hoover then entered the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hoover stated that he had looked into the question of what the United
                        States had to sell. He estimated that the amount of wheat, copper, coal and
                        iron the United States would have for export would amount to $3,000,000,000
                        during the next year. He called attention to the fact that our production is
                        “seasonal”. European countries who needed this $3,000,000,000 worth of
                        exports from us, were not in a position to purchase these goods when they
                        were seasonal. He thought, therefore, that the United States must form some
                        organization to control the sale of these exports and control the purchase
                        by <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0384"/>the European countries in such a
                        manner as to protect the United States. Through this same organization we
                        might have a lever to force these European countries to disarm and get down
                        to work.</p>
                    <p>There then ensued a discussion between Mr. Hoover and Mr. Stettinius
                        regarding the labor situation in Europe. Mr. Hoover mentioned the fact that
                        in certain places in northern France the French had 2,000 German prisoners
                        working in a certain locality, where there were 15,000 French workmen
                        idle.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stettinius then left the meeting.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners then discussed with Mr. Hoover the three following
                        telegrams which had been received from Captain Gregory in Vienna: <quote

                            <p>Ham 935. For Logan. Am sending important message which would like to
                                know if acceptable at once as working basis for business about which
                                we have been talking. Head of affair would be General Boehm who
                                accepts principle stated and believes can arrange business along
                                these lines at once.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Hoover suggested that the matter be placed on the Agenda for the Council
                        of Five at the earliest possible moment, and recommended that the civilian
                        representatives of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers in Vienna be
                        instructed to handle the matter. He was led to make this recommendation, as
                        he thought it would be very unfortunate if the French Military were mixed up
                        in the conversations with General Boehm.</p>
                    <p>In this connection Mr. Hoover seemed to think that it would be preferable if
                        his representative, Captain Gregory, should act for the United States …</p>
                    <p>After some conversation, Mr. Hoover made the proposal that the Allies should,
                        in his opinion, inform General Boehm that if the Social Democrats in Hungary
                        should set up a government of law and order and guarantee the immediate
                        calling of general elections, the Allies would undertake to treat with them
                        for peace, open the Danube, and lift the Blockade.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hoover also touched on the coal question of Central Europe, and referred
                        to the meeting of yesterday with the Germans. He pointed out that the
                        Reparations Organization Committee was starting in to make demands on the
                        Germans for the delivery of certain quantities of coal and that it was quite
                        clear that France and Italy required a large portion of the coal to be
                        supplied by Germany. He stated that Colonel Goodyear had at last been able
                        to complete the contract between the Poles, Czechs and Germans, and that
                        starting from tomorrow, under this contract, Vienna would begin to receive
                        German coal. If the Reparations Committee insisted on their demands for
                        German coal for France and Italy, it would be impossible for the Germans to
                        make the necessary shipments to Poland, Czecho-Slovakia and Vienna, although
                        the Germans had stated yesterday that they were prepared to carry out the
                        Goodyear contracts. But if the Reparations Committee insisted on their
                        demands, Germany will of course comply, and Czechs, Poles, and especially
                        the Viennese, would be left stranded.</p>
                    <p>It seemed to Mr. Hoover that his organization had better be withdrawn. Either
                        the United States should have the controlling voice or we should leave it to
                        the Europeans to arrange their own troubles.</p>
                    <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0386"/>
                    <p>Mr. Hoover spoke of the present situation in the Silesian coal fields. The
                        situation there had been torn to pieces by the propaganda carried on by the
                        Germans and the Poles. The Poles were doing all they could to keep down
                        production to force the Allies to take charge, while the Germans had
                        increased the allowances to the miners, had made other promises, and were
                        doing all they could to get as much coal as possible out of the Silesian
                        fields, before the territory was lost to them. At the present time the
                        production of the Silesian fields was about 50 per cent of what it ought to
                        be.</p>
                    <p>General Bliss suggested that it would be well to have a full memorandum
                        prepared on the whole situation showing the necessities of all countries for
                        next winter. Mr. Hoover stated that such a memorandum was already in course
                        of preparation, and that in the memorandum the necessity for some dominant
                        action would be pointed out, that it was a European action and not an
                        American action that was required, and that it was vital for Europe to
                        establish a general complete control over the whole coal situation. Mr.
                        Hoover mentioned the fact that lately there had been talk about obtaining
                        coal for Europe in the United States, and that they had spoken of obtaining
                        a million tons in America. Even if it were possible to get this out of
                        America on account of the lack of dock facilities which were now and would
                        be for the next six months entirely taken up with the handling of our
                        coastwise shipments, it would be necessary to find some two and a half
                        million tons of shipping to handle this coal, and that this would result in
                        the complete disorganization of the tonnage of the world. The world tonnage
                        situation was, in any event, going to be affected by the fact that the
                        northern neutrals had ordered coal in America, and would use their ships for
                        this purpose, when they should be engaged in other trade.</p>
                    <p>I. Major Tyler’s memorandum dated July 24th, regarding his conversation with
                        General Slatin was read.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners desired that the matter brought up in this memorandum
                        regarding the refusal of the Allies to permit the departure of an Austrian
                        Red Cross Delegation to Siberia, should be referred to the American
                        Representatives on the Prisoners of War Commission for report and
                        recommendation. <seg type="margin">Austrian Red Cross Delegation to
                            Siberia</seg></p>
                    <p>II. The Commissioners approved the dispatch of a telegram to the State
                        Department asking for an immediate reply to the cablegram of July 18. They
                        also approved the draft telegram attached to Memorandum No. 505, but desired
                        that the last sentence be stricken out, and the following inserted: <seg

                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The Commissioners also approved the suggestion that Col. Greene should be
                        asked to wait a few days longer before taking any action in the matter of
                        closing up the work of the Commission to the Baltic Provinces.</p>
                    <p>III. The Commissioners approved the payment by the Commission of Mr. Howe’s
                        transportation to the United States as stated in Memorandum No. 506. They
                        suggested, however, that before authorizing an allotment for this purpose,
                        inquiry should be made as to whether the Army would not carry Mr. Howe to
                        the United States as a member of the Peace Commission. <seg type="margin"

                        on the Teschen Commission, provided Mr. Hoover gave his consent.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners also expressed the desire to hear Mr. Goodyear regarding
                        the coal situation of Central Europe, as well as the problem involved in the
                        settlement of the Teschen question, at their next meeting. <seg

                    <p>IV. Mr. Harrison read a memorandum from Mr. Grew regarding the suggestion
                        which had been made by the French Government to the American Embassy in
                        Paris, that the American delegate on the Transportation Section of the
                        Supreme Economic Council should be present at an international meeting on
                        August 6th, to discuss the re-organization of commercial relations with
                        Oriental Europe.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners took note of the contents of the memorandum in question,
                        and suggested that Mr. Grew should call the attention of the Embassy to the
                        policy of the American Government as the Commissioners understand it, <hi
                            rend="underline">not</hi> to participate in any permanent Inter-Allied
                        Economic Commissions after the labors of the Supreme Economic Council of the

                        to having the American delegate on the Transportation Section of the Supreme
                        Economic Council attend the meeting on August 6th. If the Commissioners’
                        understanding of the policy of the Government were correct, it might be
                        desirable to call the matter to the attention of the Embassy, or the State
                        Department, so that the American Delegate in question would not commit the
                        United States Government to continued participation in any international
                        organization without obtaining definite instructions in this regard. <seg

                        Commissioners. <seg type="margin">Major Tyler’s Report of Conversation With
                            Baron Eichoff and General Slatin</seg></p>
                    <p>The Commissioners directed that the matters contained in the first paragraph
                        of Major Tyler’s memorandum should be brought to the attention of Mr. John
                        Foster Dulles for consideration and report, and that the question brought up
                        by General Slatin as reported in the last paragraph of Major Tyler’s
                        memorandum should be referred to the American Representatives on the
                        Prisoners of War Commission for consideration and report.</p>

                    <p>IV. Memorandum No. 521, recommending the withdrawal of all Field Missions as
                        soon as possible, with the exception of the Rhineland Commission, the
                        Missions to Austria and Germany, and the Tiflis Section of the South Russian
                        Mission, and an allotment of $2,000 to the last named Mission, was read.
                            <seg type="margin">Field Missions</seg></p>
                    <p>The Commissioners questioned the necessity for maintaining the Tiflis Section
                        of the South Russian Mission, in view of the report concerning the Mission
                        that had been received from Mr. Ravndal, at Constantinople. It was believed
                        that Colonel Haskell could secure any necessary information from the
                        American Consul.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners therefore directed that this question be referred back to
                        the Secretary General for further consideration.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners approved the other recommendations submitted in the
                        Memorandum in question, namely, that the Rhineland Commission, and the
                        Missions to Austria and Germany should be maintained, and that all other
                        Field Missions should be withdrawn as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>V. Memorandum No. 522, regarding military personnel of the Commission was
                        read.</p>
                    <p>General Bliss explained that his check marks on the list of officers now with
                        the Commission was not to be considered final, and was based on his
                        understanding that the officers in question were attached to Field Missions
                        and had been, or were about to be relieved. The General had not checked the
                        name of Lieutenant Milton Garver, listed as doing current intelligence
                        summaries, as he did not feel in a position to state whether this officer
                        was indispensable or no. If Lieutenant Reginald C. Foster was not to be
                        relieved but was to be demobilized in Europe, this was a matter for the
                        State Department to decide, as he was attached to the Legation at Warsaw.
                        The General had checked the name of Major Martin, as he was on the list as a
                        Field Observer. The General would have no objection to his remaining with
                        the Mission if this was thought desirable. <seg type="margin">Military
                            Personnel of the Commission</seg></p>
                    <p>The Commissioners desired that the Secretary General submit as soon as
                        possible a complete list of regular army personnel, officers, field clerks
                        and enlisted men, which General Bliss might communicate to General Pershing,
                        with a resquest that he endeavor to detail them for service with the
                        Commission.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners also desired that the Secretary General should prepare a
                        list of the temporary officers whose services with the Commission are found
                        indispensable, and who could not be substituted by regular officers.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary General was further requested, with this list, to submit a
                        memorandum of the expense which would be entailed in each <pb n="358"
                            xml:id="pg_358" facs="0394"/>case, as suggested in the ante-penultimate
                        paragraph of the memorandum under consideration, with a view to final
                        reference to the State Department, with a request for necessary
                        appropriation.</p>
                    <p>In this connection General Bliss requested that Major Tyler furnish him as
                        soon as possible with a list of the personnel to be relieved immediately
                        under the decision regarding Field Missions.</p>

                    <p>II. The Commissioners approved the recommendation that Major L. Martin be
                        relieved temporarily from service with the Peace Mission to be attached to
                        General Harbord’s Mission to Asia Minor. <seg type="margin">Release of Major

                    <p>III. The Commissioners approved the recommendation submitted in Memorandum

                        regard to the recall of the Mission on Mandates for Turkey was read.</p>
                    <p>In view of the fact that the mission had been appointed by the President for
                        a particular purpose, the Commissioners considered that it was inadvisable
                        to instruct them to return, and that they should be permitted to complete
                        their work. <seg type="margin">Return of Mission on Mandates for

                    <p>VII. The Commissioners approved the maintenance of the South Russian Field
                        Mission at Tiflis, in view of the fact that General Harbord expressed the
                        desire that they be allowed to remain on so that he might have an
                        opportunity to confer with them after his arrival in Asia Minor. <seg

                        that matter I sent down to you this morning.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I haven’t it with me.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: Very briefly: the bulletin which was
                        on my desk this morning, of the resolutions adopted is entirely different,
                        in the first place, from what we presented to the Supreme Council, and it
                        entirely changes the meaning, as I understood the resolutions that were <pb
                            n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0397"/>adopted on the first of August
                        regarding the disposition of the war materials, and which were submitted to
                        the Supreme Council. It makes it refer simply and solely to aeronautical
                        material. The resolution was first drafted in the Air Commission, the air
                        clauses to include all material, and it was expressly stated that possibly
                        it would be so broad that the members of the Commission would not care to
                        accede to it, but they did, and in that form it went to the Supreme Council,
                        and as I recollect the proceedings, there was no limitation put to it, and I
                        distinctly recall hearing Mr. Balfour say that he thought the Council could
                        accept the second point which was made, which was to not have it go outside
                        of the jurisdiction of the state to which it went, but that it first should
                        go to the military representatives at Versailles, with no limitations
                            whatsoever.<note n="24" xml:id="d130fn24">For the discussion in the

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: A vexed question is coming up: the
                        distribution of ships. It is the worst question that I see ahead. My very
                        purpose in drafting the resolution in the Air Commission was to get the
                        whole thing settled, to get some principles laid down on which the
                        Commission could work. As far as I now can see they are all going off on
                        their own tacks, with no principles to govern at all. And the resolutions I
                        introduced in the Air Commission not only mentioned all air material, but
                        further specified whether it would be used on land, on sea or air.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I will take your memorandum over with me
                        this afternoon, and speak to Mr. Balfour about it, and see that it is
                        presented properly. Dr. Scott, have you anything?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: A volume; very briefly stated, there are
                        three outstanding items, as far as the Drafting Committee is concerned, in
                        the Bulgarian Treaty. The first is, of course, the matter of the southern
                        boundaries, which is under very serious discussion, I understand, and if
                        there are to be Greek clauses, and if there are to be Turkish clauses—that
                        is, special clauses in the treaty concerning the affairs of Greece such as
                        there were concerning the Italians, in the Austrian Treaty, and if there are
                        to be special Turkish clauses—those three things are tacking, and, with the
                        exception of those three, the Bulgarian Treaty is drafted and would be ready
                        to submit, as far as that Committee is concerned, if the Supreme Council is
                        satisfied that all the terms are there.</p>
                    <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0398"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: What clauses do you have in mind that
                        should be in there?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Well, there were some clauses sent
                        in,—that is, privately sent to the chairman of the Drafting Committee—merely
                        for his information, and they were clauses concerning nationality,
                        concerning the treatment of co-religionists, and concerning distribution to
                        be made of property, the treatment to be accorded the citizens of the two
                        countries: Bulgaria and Greece. We saw at once that they were matters which
                        would need to be passed upon by the Supreme Council, and of course, we took
                        no action, even in drafting, because the principle had not been settled.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Isn’t there another committee working on
                        it?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Oh, yes, but there are three things
                        which have not as yet been definitely determined by the Supreme Council, and
                        when those three things are determined, the Treaty will be ready.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Hasn’t your committee got that?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Hudson</hi>: Our committee has made a study
                        concerning the inter-migration of Balkan peoples, and we have made a report
                        concerning those proposals to the Supreme Council, and when I asked
                        yesterday that the report be presented to the attention of the Supreme
                        Council, it was stated that nothing can be done until the boundaries of
                        Greece and Bulgaria are settled. It seems to me that that is not true, and
                        that Mr. Venizelos’ proposals for inter-migration of Balkan peoples may be
                        passed upon by the Supreme Council tentatively, and that our Committee be
                        given the authority which it asks, to negotiate with Mr. Venizelos on the
                        subject, and that those clauses can be agreed upon, even though the
                        frontier, as far as Thrace is concerned, is not settled.</p>
                    <p>I wish the report could receive the attention of the Supreme Council and the
                        Committee could be given the authority to negotiate—to deal with Mr.
                        Venizelos. I think it does not infringe upon the jurisdiction of Mr.
                        Nielsen’s committee, because this is a matter, Mr. Nielsen, of the
                        interchange of peoples, where a village in Bulgaria wants to pick up and
                        move into Greece.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: I was under the impression that I saw
                        a notice indicating that the Supreme Council had referred this to the
                        Committee on Political Clauses. I am afraid that is what has happened.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Hudson</hi>: I cannot find that that is true. I
                        heard, last week, that that was true, but I have not found any record.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: I think that is probably true, but we
                        have not considered it at all.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Is that one of your committees?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: But you have not heard it yet?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: I saw a notice.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: But you have not considered it?</p>
                    <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0399"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: No, we have not considered it at
                        all.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: It does not seem to me possible to
                        complete your treaty until those matters receive attention, because it seems
                        to me they are essential.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Exactly. And on this occasion I have
                        called your attention to the fact that there are three outstanding matters
                        on which an agreement would have to be reached before the treaty could be
                        presented.</p>
                    <p>Then a word about the Hungarian Treaty. We have been requested to pick it up
                        and to put it into shape, following, as far as possible, the procedure with
                        the German Treaty and with the Austrian Treaty, and the resolutions already
                        had in the matter by the previous Supreme Council during the time the
                        President was here.</p>
                    <p>To make what might be a long report, a very brief one,—there are four or five
                        matters outstanding. All the other matters can be considered, and have
                        practically been drafted in accordance with reports of commissions and with
                        the decisions of the Supreme Council,—except these four or five which I
                        should like to lay before you.</p>
                    <p>They are: the military, naval and air clauses for Hungary; a preliminary
                        report of these matters; that the draft was made on the 7th of June, and
                        Col. Grant can state the extent to which that represents the views of the
                        committee. The project concerning the Prisoners of War has not been received
                        or presented to the Supreme Council. It will likely be based upon that of
                        the German and Austrian treaties, which will have some changes because of
                        the different terms in the armistice. Two clauses upon Reparation and
                        Finance. Both of these are lacking. And of the report on Ports and
                        Waterways, the technical clauses concerning Railways, etc., are left. But
                        with the exception of these—1, 2, 3, 4 and a part of the 6th—the Treaty is
                        so far advanced that it is already in print.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: You might let us have a memorandum of
                        that treaty. I was going to say that a great many of your labors have been
                        taken from you by the Roumanians, because they are making peace on their own
                        terms: a brand new armistice today.</p>
                    <p>Have you the Ports and Waterways clauses? (Addressing Dr. Hudson.)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Hudson</hi>: I thought they were all done. I am
                        surprised to hear that they are lacking.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Have you anything more?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: No.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Colonel Grant, have you anything?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel Grant</hi>: No.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Mr. Nielsen?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: There is on the agenda a rather
                        important thing this afternoon relating to certain clauses that this
                        Committee that you <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0400"/>just mentioned
                        has framed. I mention it, not because it is on the agenda, but because I
                        think the Commissioners will probably want instructions from Washington.
                        These clauses govern certain matters that grow out of the breaking up of the
                        Austro-Hungarian empire, such as joint railroad rates between the new states
                        and Austria and Hungary, coast-wise trade, and the restoration of articles
                        belonging in one or another of the states, and contemplating a number of new
                        conveyances. It was the Italian plan to have these new articles framed
                        without having the Slav states consulted, and without negotiating with them,
                        and that I objected to, and others did also, and I thought that we were
                        proceeding on the plan that these new states would, with our assistance,
                        conclude this treaty. The idea was to have it signed when the Austrian
                        treaty was signed. But the plan now proposed is that the Five Principal
                        Allied and Associated Powers should be signatories to this treaty, with the
                        idea that although these questions are local, still they have some interest
                        for all those who have been in the war.</p>
                    <p>Now I presume the Commissioners would want to have that treaty submitted to
                        Washington, perhaps, and this is the first opportunity I have had to bring
                        it up. I would suggest that these articles, which collectively are not very
                        lengthy, might be telegraphed to Washington, with a brief explanation made
                        of this thing, and inquiry made as to whether we will sign, as I think the
                        others will, such a treaty as we finally agreed to.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Will you prepare such a telegram and send
                        it immediately.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: The only other minor point I would
                        like to bring up is with regard to this Spitzbergen Treaty. The idea is to
                        frame a treaty acknowledging sovereignty and not binding ourselves,—which we
                        will have to do some time. The British have introduced an article with
                        regard to the moral rights that have been acquired in these northern
                        countries and the adjustment of these rights by arbitration, and then
                        propose in there that an arbitrator be named by the United States of America
                        as well as other countries which have a claim. In the absence of
                        instructions I made no objections to that, because there are no obligations
                        involved at all. The compensation will come from the other interested
                        countries; it will merely be the designation of the lawyers. So I don’t see
                        any great harm in that. But I probably could still have it stricken out. I
                        favor leaving it in.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I gather that you are in favor of it.
                        (Addressing Dr. Scott.)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Decidedly.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: There is no political interest
                        involved.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: If they suggest that we appoint an
                        arbitrator, I see no reason why we should not do it.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I don’t know. Do you know, Mr.
                        Harrison?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: As I remember it, sir, that question
                        of the disposition of that little strip of territory, that no man’s land in
                        Bukovina, came up, and after the recommendation was approved, Mr. Polk
                        raised the question whether it be to include the whole valley or not, one
                        way or the other.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: It came up the other day. It is the
                        British line that is the most northerly line, and I suggested that as that
                        line ran down at the bottom of the valley, they take, instead, the crest on
                        one side or the other—I didn’t care which way or which side it went,—but not
                        to take the bottom of the valley, not to make a line of division at the
                        bottom of the valley and have the two people on either side of the line in
                        the valley staring across at each other constantly. That was adopted.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: And then they continued the
                        discussion, and talked about Bessarabia, but at Mr. Balfour’s suggestion,
                        they were not to take any decision at all until Roumania would take a more
                        conservative attitude.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Further than that, this Commission is not
                        prepared to discuss the disintegration of the Russian empire,—its
                        dismemberment.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Johnson</hi>: The situation regarding Thrace—may I
                        say a word with regard to that?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Please do.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Johnson</hi>: There was a meeting of the Central
                        Territorial Committee called yesterday afternoon to consider further the
                        Thracian question. In the course of the discussion, the object of which was
                        to see if we could possibly find an intermediate point of view between those
                        who wished to give most of the territory to Greece which is being claimed by
                        Greece—but not quite all—and the American point of view, which was to not
                        take any of this territory from Bulgaria which belonged to her at the
                        beginning of the war. There was perhaps an hour or an hour and one-half’s
                        discussion, in the course of which it developed that the suggestion for
                        placing Thrace under International control, which has been made by the
                        Americans—and it was not very favorably received when it was first suggested
                        in the Council—was supported by the Italians, and the Japanese also said
                        that they were rather inclined to that solution. So that the complexion <pb
                            n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0402"/>of the situation had changed rather
                        materially in favor of the American point of view. In the Commission’s
                        meetings we came to no conclusion. The situation is that the Americans took
                        the position that the best intermediate solution was the one which was
                        suggested on the basis of the President’s telegram, of putting the territory
                        under international control rather than giving it to Greece, or leaving it
                        to Bulgaria. And there was some support of that from the Italians and from
                        the Japanese.</p>
                    <p>Then in the discussion in the Council Mr. Balfour suggested as a compromise
                        giving quite a considerable portion of that territory back to Bulgaria, but
                        still cutting her off from the sea by a very narrow band, narrowing the
                        strip to Greece, and in principle they accepted Mr. Tittoni’s suggestion to
                        give it back to Bulgaria, with quite a slice of territory to Greece. But the
                        approach to the American point of view was more marked.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: As a matter of fact I went over the
                        question this morning with a gentleman named Boucher. There was a very
                        strong feeling in Great Britain against the British plan here.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Johnson</hi>: It is very intense; the feeling is
                        very intense.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: What I meant to say was that Mr.
                        Venizelos made a great point of that port—Portolaga (?) [<hi rend="italic"
                            >Portolagos</hi>], Now the line I suggested the other day would take
                        that in and give it to Greece. Now that would strike off one of Veniselos’
                        great objections, according to this man. One of the great fears he expressed
                        concerning this was that it might be a possible submarine base.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Was that in the Greek section?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Johnson</hi>: The statement was made by Mr.
                        Venizelos, before the Greek parliament, at the end of the second Balkan War,
                        as to the Greeks wanting to claim that territory, that it would be a
                        dangerous geographical frontier to have a long, narrow strip, without any
                        background; that she was much better off without it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: I would like to ask a question. We
                        received today the Austrian answer. I confess I am not clear how seriously
                        we were expected to examine it—to take it. On the one hand we are to take
                        anything that they say, that is reasonable, and consider it; and on the
                        other hand, the minute you suggest any change in anything you are met with
                        the argument that you are breaking a bargain; that the point has only been
                        reached as the result of compromise and discussion, and we have no right to
                        raise that whole question.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I don’t think that ought to stand for one
                        minute. If they can point out anything in the treaty that should and can be
                        changed, it seems to me that we should make a try to have it changed.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: I think the whole question whether
                        this new examination is a real one or merely a formal one, is not at all
                        clear.</p>
                    <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0403"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I think it should be real. Don’t you,
                        General?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: Yes, sir, I think so.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. A. W. Dulles</hi>: Another question. When the German
                        reply was presented, as I remember it the Supreme Council indicated to the
                        technical commissions that they wished an examination of various phases of
                        the various questions raised by the Germans. It came from the top down to
                        the Committee. Now the question arises whether a similar procedure will be
                        followed, or whether the various committees will make the examination
                        without any decision from the Supreme Council.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I don’t know, but I imagine it will be
                        transmitted, to save time.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: If they are to have instructions, I
                        hope they will come today, so we can waste no time.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Johnson</hi>: There is this one question that comes
                        up in connection with the frontiers, in the territorial matters. When the
                        Commission has drawn a line, after studying the question,—for geographic or
                        various reasons it invariably happens that there are certain places where
                        you must favor one side or the other, and then, as an offset, you favor the
                        other side in another place, and anyone can make a point concerning the
                        first place, but when such a point is made, the whole question should be
                        considered.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: But if they show something that is
                        clearly an error.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Johnson</hi>: If it is a detail of that kind you
                        have to open up the whole question.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Hudson</hi>: May I ask whether the Commissioners
                        have taken any stand on the Austrian suggestion that the treaty ought to be
                        constructed on the theory that the whole Austro-Hungarian empire is being
                        liquidated, and that, as far as the states previously forming part of the
                        Austro-Hungarian empire are concerned, there ought to be complete
                        reciprocity at once, in the navigation of rivers, transit, etc. The Economic
                        people have reduced their period of reciprocity from five to three
                        years.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: The idea was simply to make a slight
                        concession there, that was all.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: When the Austrian Treaty came up, I
                        think it may be generally said that the idea was to take the German Treaty
                        as a basis and draw the Austrian Treaty on that basis. Various delegations
                        thought the Treaty should be treated the other way.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Hudson</hi>: I think the Austrians’ objection is
                        thoroughly right. The Austrians, I think, are going to live intolerable
                        lives if we continue to make the kind of clauses that are in the treaty,
                        without reciprocity, in the Ports, Waterways and Railways. I think the
                        Austrians make a very strong claim. They say there should at least <pb
                            n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0404"/>be territorial reciprocity between
                        the states formed out of the former Austro-Hungarian empire.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I think that that has not been acted
                        upon. Have they made a protest along that line?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Hudson</hi>: The Austrians have, yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: What has been done with it?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Hudson</hi>: Nothing has been done. It has been
                        voiced a number of times in their communications.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: It will probably be repeated in their
                        protest today.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Hudson</hi>: I don’t doubt it will be repeated. In
                        the Ports, Waterways and Railways Commission it was impossible for us to get
                        on with the consideration of the Austrian reply without some indication from
                        above of the policy toward the Austrian Treaty.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: That should be brought up as soon as we
                        get the answer. It seems to me that would be a very important question to be
                        considered.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: That thing has come up very largely in
                        connection with customs matters, but there has been no disposition among
                        those who have worked on those clauses to decide that the new states and
                        Austria should be on terms of equality. The argument, as Mr. Hudson
                        suggests, is strong, but I don’t believe that anybody has shown a tendency
                        to take that view. I think it would be very difficult to bring about an
                        acceptance of any such view.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. A. W. Dulles</hi>: As I remember it, the Austrian
                        Treaty was drawn on the theory that Austria was an old state, and had to
                        renounce possession; then the head of the British delegation presented a
                        draft pointing out that it should be a liquidation of the old monarchy. The
                        treaty was drawn up first on the old theory and then a preamble was inserted
                        on the new theory. The Austrians claim that they do not own Bukovina, and
                        they cannot renounce something they do not own.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Hudson</hi>: The Serbian delegation has sent a
                        letter to the president of the conference protesting against that article in
                        the Austrian Treaty which would require the Serb-Croat-Slovene state to
                        accept a provision for the protection of minorities, etc., in a treaty with
                        the ‘ Principal Allied and Associated Powers. The Serb-Croat-Slovene letter
                        indicates that they may attempt to sign the Austrian Treaty with a
                        reservation as to that article. It seems to me that that might produce some
                        embarrassment at the time of the signing of the Austrian Treaty.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Isn’t that a similar situation as the
                        Chinese reservation?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: That question, Mr. White, would be a
                        little different. It would be a little stronger in favor of China, because
                        at the time it was <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0405"/>submitted at the
                        Plenary Session China made distinct reservation as to this article and
                        requested that this reservation be spread upon the minutes, and practically
                        made its acceptance subject to that, so that when it proceeded to sign, it
                        would sign in pursuance of the acceptance of the treaty as it had made it on
                        that particular day. And that ruling being made in the case of China would
                        be rather stronger than in the case of a nation that had made no exception
                        at the time.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: It would be stronger against Serbia?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: It would be stronger against Serbia.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Hudson</hi>: The Serbo-Croats will say that they
                        never saw the article before it was presented to the Austrians, and they
                        never had a chance to accept the treaty before it was given to the
                        Austrians, and that this is their first chance to protest. That is what they
                        will say.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: May I say, Mr. Polk, that I think the
                        Teschen question is one that should receive the attention of the Supreme
                        Council very soon, since the delay which the Council has granted to the
                        Czecho-Slovak and Polish governments within which to try to reach an
                        agreement between themselves expired last night, and I believe that Mr.
                        Benes has presented a note for the Czechs asking that the Council settle the
                        question before them. There is on that subject a joint report of the Polish
                        and Czecho-Slovak Commissions of last April, and I have a little fear that a
                        certain delegation may attempt to lay that report before the Supreme Council
                        and attempt to get a decision on the basis of that. As a matter of fact, a
                        great deal has happened since April, and much new information has been
                        received, and at present I believe the majority of both those commissions
                        would recommend another solution of those questions if the matter was
                        referred back to them. So I think it is the opinion of the American
                        representatives, at least, in those commissions, that it might be well if
                        the Council would refer the question back to the Czecho-Slovak and Polish
                        Commissions and ask for a definitive recommendation.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: When the question of giving an
                        extension of time to the Czecho-Slavs and Poles, as they requested, came up,
                        the Supreme Council instructed the chairman of the Commission to prepare a
                        solution which would be ready and which the Supreme Council would act upon
                        and consider in case the Czechs and Poles did not get together at the end of
                        this period.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: Yes, there was a phrase: “to study it”. I
                        don’t know whether that in itself is enough to warrant the two Commissions
                        in presenting the recommendation at once.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: It was to have something ready so the
                        Supreme Council could act.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: We might suggest that we have no
                        objection to them proceeding to an investigation of the subject.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: I suggested to the French yesterday that
                        we do that, but they held that we were not authorized to do that without
                        further word from the Council.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: I notice that the Yugo-Slav delegation
                        have sent a note to the Supreme Council asking about the difference between
                        the nationality clauses as affecting former Austro-Hungarians in Jugo-Slavia
                        as against the former Austro-Hungarian subjects in Italy. That seems to me
                        to be very serious. It will come before you in time. Speaking offhand, there
                        seems to be a good deal of justice in that complaint. It would seem to me
                        that people of that kind ought to have about the same opportunity to obtain
                        nationality in their own countries.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Might I remark that it seems probable
                        that all these treaties that are now on the docket could be prepared and
                        ready for delivery on the 25th of the month.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: They will be?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: They could be if steps were taken to

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: If you will give me a memorandum of this
                        I will bring it up tomorrow.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Yes, it really can be done.</p>
                    <p>The meeting adjourned at 2:40 p.m.</p>

                    <p>I. The Secretary read memoranda submitted by Major Tyler dated August 4th and
                        August 6th regarding conversations with Baron Eichoff of the Austrian Peace
                        Delegation.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners desired that the suggestion in regard to
                        “Ungarisch-Altenburg” mentioned in the first paragraph of Major Tyler’s
                        memorandum of August 4, 1919, be referred to the Territorial Experts for an
                        expression of their opinion. <seg type="margin">Conversations With Baron

                    <p>II. Memorandum No. 528 regarding a request submitted by Captain Richard S.
                        Wise for two automobiles for the use of the Mission composed of Lieutenant
                        Colonel William A. Jones and Captain Richard S. Wise in connection with the
                        Czecho-Slovak-Magyar frontier, was read out. <seg type="margin">Automobiles
                            for Lieut. Colonel Jones and Capt. Wise</seg></p>
                    <p>The Commissioners disapproved the assignment of two of the Commission’s
                        machines to this Mission. It was pointed out by General Bliss that these
                        officers had been appointed by the War Department upon the request of the
                        American Minister to Prague for special service with the French Commander in
                        Chief of the Czecho-Slovak Army. Consequently this Mission is in no way
                        connected with the Peace Commission, and a decision as regards their request
                        rests with the American Legation at Prague, the State Department and the War
                        Department.</p>
                    <p>III. The Secretary read extracts from two letters addressed by the American
                        Minister at Warsaw to the Secretary General in which Mr. Gibson expressed
                        the hope that the Commissioners might find an opportunity to hear Captain
                        Earl Bassett on the general situation in Poland. <seg type="margin">Visit of
                            Captain Earl Bassett</seg></p>
                    <p>The Commissioners expressed their desire to hear Mr. Bassett.</p>
                    <p>IV. Memorandum No. 529 in regard to certain recommendations submitted by
                        Major Devereux relating (1) to the establishment of consulates in the Baltic
                        Provinces and (2) the freedom of access to the Baltic Provinces for American
                        commercial representatives and relief workers, was read out. <seg

                        this regard submitted with the memorandum in question.</p>
                    <p>V. The Secretary read out a memorandum prepared by Professor A. C. Coolidge
                        and countersigned by Mr. Dresel, Mr. Dulles, Mr. Buckler, Major Tyler and
                        Dr. Lord concerning the policy to be adopted by the Commission in regard to
                        the settlement of the frontiers of states which have been formed out of the
                        territories of what was formerly the Russian Empire. (Memorandum No. 530).

                    <p>The Commissioners thought favorably of the recommendations contained in this
                        memorandum and directed that a telegram to the Secretary of State and the
                        President be prepared based on the memorandum and requesting instructions in

                        they had cut off all telephone communication in private houses; that they
                        were seizing all sewing machines, factory machines and motor cars. In a word
                        he considered the present Rumanian action to be an efficient looting
                        expedition and tried [<hi rend="italic">carried?</hi>] on by a second rate
                        state in the face of the wishes of the Conference. Moreover, the Bratiano
                        Government had been about to fall and he believed that the Rumanian
                        counterattack against the Hungarians had been a desperate effort on the part
                        of Bratiano to re-establish his position. As it happened it had turned [out]
                        to be a magnificent success. Mr. Buxton asked whether any means had been
                        found to coerce Rumania. In reply Mr. Polk stated that the Conference seemed
                        to have no immediate means. While the Rumanians now seemed to be
                        independent, they would shortly find themselves in a difficult position, say
                        in about six months, when they would undoubtedly present requests for
                        financial assistance from the United States and Great Britain. The Rumanians
                        had been told that they could not expect such economic assistance from the
                        United States and he knew Mr. Balfour felt the same way as regards
                        assistance from England. <seg type="margin">Hearing of Mr. Buxton From
                            Budapest</seg></p>
                    <p>Mr. Buxton observed that the Rumanian Government was not representing the
                        Rumanian people but was, in fact, a small clique … Mr. Buxton also spoke of
                        the attitude of the Rumanian soldiers in Budapest and stated that a Rumanian
                        soldier had bayonetted a woman in whose house he was billeted. He pointed
                        out, however, the chief type <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0410"/>of
                        outrage now being practiced was against the former Reds and that the whites
                        were undoubtedly hunting suspected Bolsheviks. He believed that disorder
                        would have been less if the compromise government of Peidl had been kept
                        going. He said that the Rumanians had refused to let him depart by train,
                        and that he finally got away by motor. The foreign press representatives in
                        Budapest had reported rumors of pogroms, also that 300 to 500 persons had
                        been killed. It was uncertain whether this was true. Just before Mr. Buxton
                        left Budapest arrangements had been made to get some food into the city from
                        Vienna. The reactionary Hungarians who had taken refuge in Austria were now
                        streaming back to Budapest.</p>
                    <p>As regards the Archduke Joseph, Mr. Buxton said that he was a good fellow,
                        that he was very popular and had been one of the few who had not run away on
                        the event [<hi rend="italic">advent?</hi>] of the Reds to power.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Polk asked Mr. Buxton how far the Rumanians had been responsible for the
                        overthrow of the Peidl Government and the setting up of the Government under
                        Archduke Joseph.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Buxton answered that General Gorton was of the opinion that the change in
                        government had been entirely due to the support given by the Rumanians. The
                        latter had got together with Hungarian <hi rend="italic">Gendarmerie</hi>
                        and had armed them. Moreover, the <hi rend="italic">Gendarmerie</hi> had
                        been able to feel that they were backed by the Rumanian forces. As a matter
                        of fact, however, even before the <hi rend="italic">coup d’état</hi>, the
                        Peidl Government machine had been lying idle as they had no means of
                        enforcing their authority in the presence of the Rumanian occupation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Buxton said that the food situation on Wednesday had been very bad, that
                        there was no food at all, even for the hospitals. The situation had been
                        critical until the Americans managed to get some food in on Thursday.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Buxton then withdrew.</p>
                    <p>II. The Commissioners approved the request of General Harbord’s organization
                        for permission to take to Armenia certain reports belonging to the
                        Commission as stated in Memorandum No. 537. <seg type="margin">Loan of

                    <p>III. General Bliss said that he had received a letter from General Weygand
                        asking for the appointment of the American officers to the Organizing
                        Commission of Control in accordance with the decision taken by the Supreme
                        Council at its mating of August 8th.<note n="26" xml:id="d133fn26">HD–27,

                        pointed out that he had already informed Marshal Foch that it would be
                        impossible for the United States to appoint representatives to take part in
                        commissions under the Treaty with Germany until the ratification of the
                        Treaty by the United States. He would therefore have to answer General
                        Weygand’s letter in that sense. <seg type="margin">American Participation in
                            Commission of Control</seg></p>
                    <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0411"/>
                    <p>General Bliss also suggested that in approving the creation or appointment of
                        commissions, it would be well for purposes of record to state that the
                        United States would be unable to participate in such commissions until the
                        treaty had been ratified.</p>
                    <p>IV. The Commissioners had before them a memorandum from Mr. Nielsen asking
                        that military and naval representatives be appointed to attend the meeting
                        to be held tomorrow, August 12th, regarding the revision of the Treaties of
                        1839. <seg type="margin">Appointment of Military and Naval Experts To Attend

                    <p>General Bliss designated Colonel Embick to attend the meeting as military
                        representative, and the Secretary was directed to request Admiral Knapp to
                        designate a naval representative for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>V. The Commissioners directed the Secretary to consult Admiral Knapp
                        regarding action to be taken on Department’s telegram No. 2767, August 8, 8
                        p.m., regarding cable communication between Manila and Shanghai. <seg
                            type="margin">Cable Communication Between Manila and Shanghai</seg></p>
                    <p>VI. Mr. Polk stated that he had had a conversation with Mr. Hudson of the
                        Editing Committee. Mr. Hudson had recommended the recasting of the Austrian
                        Treaty, an opportunity for which was presented in making the reply to the
                        Austrian observations, and had requested instructions from the Commission in
                        the matter. <seg type="margin">Recasting the Austrian Treaty</seg></p>
                    <p>Mr. Polk stated that he agreed with Mr. Hudson’s views.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners decided to authorize Mr. Hudson or his successor on the
                        Editing Committee to support the proposal of their British colleague,
                        looking to the recasting of the Austrian Treaty.</p>
                    <p>VII. The Secretary read certain telegrams which had been received over Mr.
                        Hoover’s wires from Budapest since the last meeting of the Commission.
                        First, a telegram dated August 7th, from Colonel Causey to Mr. Hoover
                        regarding the railroad situation; second, a telegram dated August 8th, from
                        General Gorton to Colonel Twiss of the British Mission; third, a telegram
                        from Archduke Joseph to Mr. Clemenceau dated August 8th; fourth, a telegram
                        from Colonel Causey dated August 8th, to Messrs. Hoover and Atwood; fifth, a
                        telegram from General Gorton, dated August 9th, to Mr. Balfour. <seg

                    <p>VIII. The Commissioners had before them telegram No. 2750 of August 7th, 6
                        p.m., from the State Department, addressed to Mr. Polk, asking that he
                        confer with General Bliss and Mr. Parker of the Liquidation Committee with a
                        view to supplying the forces acting under General Yudenitch with military

                        and their employment by the Commission at their present army salaries.</p>
                    <p>In this connection the Commissioners desired the Secretary General submit a
                        list of temporary officers now attached to the Commission whose
                        demobilization in Europe should be requested of the War Department, and that
                        a telegram to the Secretary of State be prepared for their approval, giving
                        the names of these officers, requesting the Secretary of State to ask the
                        Secretary of War to permit these officers to remain with the Mission as long
                        as possible, say until September 20th, and that the Secretary of War
                        instruct General Pershing that they be demobilized at that time. <seg

                    <p>I. General Harbord, who was accompanied by General McCoy, informed the
                        Commissioners that it appeared that it would be impossible to obtain the
                        Transport <hi rend="italic">DeKalb</hi> to convey them to Armenia. General
                        Harbord submitted the following telegram: <seg type="margin">General

                                used for the purpose of going to Armenia unless conditions make such

                    <p>General Harbord explained that the <hi rend="italic">DeKalb</hi> was the only
                        suitable ship available in European waters for the purpose. Mr. Polk
                        thereupon dictated a telegram to the Secretary of State requesting that the
                        matter be laid before the President and that the President be urged to
                        direct the Navy Department to place the <hi rend="italic">DeKalb</hi> at the
                        disposal of the Mission. General Harbord pointed out that the <hi
                            rend="italic">DeKalb</hi> was particularly suited for this purpose,
                        inasmuch as it was fitted up as an auxiliary cruiser, carried guns, and was
                        just the sort of vessel desired by the Mission.</p>
                    <p>General Harbord stated that he was prepared to leave Friday and to set sail
                        from Brest on Saturday, if the question of the ship were settled. He also
                        submitted a list of personnel which was approved, and a draft letter of
                        instructions which was slightly modified and approved.</p>
                    <p>General Harbord also requested that the President of the Conference should be
                        informed of his Mission, and that the representatives of the Principal
                        Allied Powers in Asia Minor and Constantinople be advised of his Mission.
                        Drafts of communications to the Secretary General of the Peace Conference in
                        this regard were submitted by Mr. Buckler, who was requested to change them
                        in certain particulars to meet the views of the Commissioners.</p>
                    <p>General Harbord recommended that a publicity man be attached to his Mission,
                        and mentioned the names of Mr. Bass and Mr. Selden. The Commissioners had no
                        objection to the General’s proposal, if he thought it desirable to have a
                        publicity man with the Mission.</p>
                    <p>At this point Mr. Polk left the meeting.</p>
                    <p>II. Memorandum No. 539 regarding a request received from Mr. Henry Morgenthau
                        for an additional allotment of $15,000 for his Mission was read out. <seg

                    <p>The Commissioners approved the recommendations contained in the Memorandum in
                        question, namely, that in view of the present condition of the funds of the
                        Mission, $10,000 only be allotted to Mr. Morgenthau.</p>

                    <p>III. The Commissioners approved the recommendation for the release of 1st
                        Lieut. Milton Garver from duty with the Commission to be effective August
                        20th, as set forth in Memorandum No. 540. <seg type="margin">Release of
                            Lieutenant Garver</seg></p>
                    <p>IV. The Secretary read a memorandum submitted by Major General Summerall
                        requesting that a communication be addressed to the Italian Government
                        expressing the appreciation of the American Government for the courtesies
                        shown him by Lieutenant General Grazioli at Fiume. <seg type="margin"
                            >Expression of Appreciation to Italian Government for Courtesies Shown
                            to General Summerall</seg></p>
                    <p>The Commissioners approved General Summerall’s suggestion, and directed that
                        an appropriate letter to Mr. Tittoni be immediately prepared for Mr. Polk’s
                        signature expressing on behalf of the American Government appreciation for
                        the courtesies shown General Summerall by General Grazioli.</p>
                    <p>V. Telegram No. 7-A of August 7, 4 p.m., which had been received from the
                        American Chargé d’Affaires, Bucharest, through the French Foreign Office was
                        read.</p>
                    <p>In view contents of this telegram the Commissioners considered that no
                        purpose would be served by having the Chargé d’Affaires carry out the
                        instructions contained in Mission’s telegram No. 23 of August 4, 5 p.m., and
                        therefore desired that a telegram be sent to the Chargé d’Affaires directing
                        him to disregard those instructions. <seg type="margin">Representation to

                    <p>VI. The Commissioners approved the recommendation contained in Memorandum No.
                        541, that Colonel U. S. Grant III, be appointed the American member on the
                        Ports, Waterways and Railways Commission to succeed Dr. Hudson. <seg

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Col. Grant, have you any
                        observations?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Prof. Coolidge?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: The Central Territorial Committee
                        is struggling with one or two questions. It has the Austrian one in hand; I
                        think we will come to an agreement this afternoon. There will be a few
                        changes—I am speaking of the territorial side of the Austrian question—and
                        it will then be ready to go to the Co-ordinating Commission, and there seems
                        to be some uncertainty as to what the Co-ordinating Commission is or is not
                        to do: whether it is merely to be occupied with textual revision, or whether
                        it is to have an opinion of its own.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: We were to settle that important
                        question.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: I don’t know whether they have had
                        a meeting. Mr. Woolsey represents us. He yesterday raised the question
                        whether our recommendations were final before going to the Supreme Council,
                        or whether the Co-ordinating Commission might change them.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Well, is it for us to pass on it?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: No, I don’t think so.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: I heard Monday that the reply to the
                        Austrians in regard to the nationality clauses might be delayed somewhat.
                        The Committee on Political Clauses has considered that subject. It has not
                        framed its reply, principally because there was a hitch in regard to the
                        Drafting Committee.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Dr. Lord?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: The Polish Commission has had for some
                        time three problems on its hands, none of which it seems to get finished.
                        The East Galician question is almost ready for report; in accordance with
                        instructions from the Supreme Council we have drafted a kind of treaty
                        containing the outlines of the constitution for Eastern Galicia as an
                        autonomous province of Poland. That draft is in the hands of the Redaction
                        Committee now, which is going to confer with us this afternoon about it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: What is the question, in a general
                        way?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: That Eastern Galicia should be under the
                        sovereignty of Poland, provisionally, until a consultation of the population
                        some time in the future, the date of which we are precluded from making any
                        recommendations about. That during this provisional regime the <pb n="381"
                            xml:id="pg_381" facs="0417"/>country should have the most complete
                        guarantee for the racial, linguistic and religious rights of the different
                        populations there, and as wide a measure of local autonomy as seems
                        practicable.</p>
                    <p>We are proposing a local diet, a local cabinet of ministers responsible to
                        the diet, and an independent judiciary—on the whole, a kind of provincial
                        autonomy.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand the Polish government will have control; they are
                        represented by a governor who will have the veto on the diet. And in other
                        ways we are trying to make Poland able to keep order in that rather
                        turbulent and distracted country.</p>
                    <p>There is one difficulty. I hear that Mr. Paderewski is coming back in a day
                        or so, and I understand that he is coming back to attack the whole
                        arrangement, that is, in so far as it does apply to an eventual plebiscite.
                        The Poles do not object to the autonomy, but they object to the uncertainty
                        that they will feel from the fact that in ten or fifteen years nobody is
                        going to know quite what is going to be the definitive status of this
                        country.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Why must they wait so long?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: Well, that is just the opinion.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: What are the arguments now? That they
                        cannot tell now what they want?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: Partly that, and partly that the country
                        has got to be pretty thoroughly reconstructed; that it would be a matter of
                        ten years, probably, and it has suffered terribly from the war; it has been
                        conquered four or five times, and there is a big work of reconstruction to
                        be carried out there, and we think also that a big work of education should
                        be carried out. The people are frightfully ignorant—the great majority
                        illiterate, and it seems it would be only the part of wisdom to give them a
                        certain time to acquire more education and maturity.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: That seems only reasonable.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: Then the other question. We have the
                        Teschen question, which is sent back to us from the Supreme Council. That is
                        up for discussion at present, and I hope that within about a week we shall
                        have a recommendation for the Supreme Council.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Have you given up all hope of their
                        coming to an agreement? Do you suppose they are more in the humor now of
                        falling in with any arrangement made by the Supreme Council than they were
                        before?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: Both of them recognize that they cannot
                        agree among themselves. Both of them want to have it settled, I think, by
                        the Supreme Council, in order that neither government will assume
                        responsibility for the concessions that each side will have to make.</p>
                    <p>And then our third question is about the Eastern Frontier of Poland, which is
                        going to be a very difficult question. It is largely a question <pb n="382"
                            xml:id="pg_382" facs="0418"/>of policy there. I don’t known whether this
                        is the proper place to raise it, although I should very much like to get
                        instructions some day on that subject. It raises the question whether,
                        pending the restoration of Russia, Poland should be left without any kind of
                        frontier on the East, or whether she should receive some kind of provisional
                        frontiers until there is a recognized government in Russia again, after
                        which there will have to be an agreement between Poland and Russia, and very
                        probably there will have to be a mediation by the League of Nations.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: I should think that there should be some
                        kind of a line.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel Grant</hi>: I should think that would very much
                        alleviate a great many of the difficulties that occur—the interference of
                        the Germans there. There is constant action all along that front, not only
                        in Poland, but in those other countries.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: In that connection the representative of
                        Bessarabia said he understood that Roumania was going to hold an election in
                        Bessarabia for members, from Bessarabia, to the Roumanian parliament. He was
                        very anxious that the Council should recognize that fact.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Buckler</hi>: Mr. Polk raised the same point, of the
                        plebiscite that is going to be held in provinces that were formerly parts of
                        Russia.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Only Bessarabia has a defined limit, and
                        as I understand, in this proposed election to be held in old Russia, it is
                        in a more or less undefined area—or is it defined?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: Well, it is a continually growing
                        election. It is in Vilna and Grodno. As their armies move forward they
                        continue to hold elections.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Do you think it would be wise for the
                        Conference to give notice to the Roumanians?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: I don’t think it is wise for the
                        Council to meddle in it one way and not the other. I don’t think they ought
                        to meddle in the question until they know what they are going to do.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: We have laid down the rule that we do
                        not think that any of the territory that we formerly called Russian
                        territory should be disposed of until we know what the Russian situation
                        will be.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: When was that laid down?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: I think that was laid down by Mr.

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: But Mr. Lansing spoke of the Polish

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: I think the nearest to a thoroughly
                        official act is in the note of the Council of Four to Admiral Koltchak in
                        which they make a distinction between Bessarabia and other parts of the
                        former Russian Empire.<note n="29" xml:id="d136fn29">See appendix I to

                                    >vi</hi>, p. 73</ref>.</note> They expressly reserve the right
                        of the Peace Conference here to settle the Bessarabian question. As for the
                        frontier of Russia towards Poland and Finland, they ask only that Koltchak
                        agree that in case those frontiers could not be settled by a voluntary
                        agreement between the two parties, that Koltchak’s government should accept
                        the collaboration, and some other phrase like “mediation” of the League of
                        Nations. That seemed to contemplate an immediate settlement of the
                        Bessarabian question by the Peace Conference.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: It is terrible the way things are said
                        to be going on in Bessarabia; if what is being done in Buda-Pesth is any
                        criterion it is probably more or less true. Russian language prohibited, and
                        anybody suspected of Russian proclivities deported.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel Grant</hi>: Couldn’t that Polish frontier
                        question be settled by recognizing a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                        frontier? That would to a certain extent, I think, settle the constant
                        bickerings up there on frontiers for the moment, until the Russian frontier
                        is solved by force of arms, or whatever way it is solved.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Would you exclude Bessarabia and
                        Roumania?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel Grant</hi>: I was not referring to the
                        Bessarabian question, which, as Dr. Lord says, deserves a special
                        settlement, for it is very much mixed up by the Roumanian situation at the
                        present time. The proposition of [<hi rend="italic">is?</hi>] the east
                        frontier of Poland and the Baltic states.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: I think it would be the sense of the
                        meeting that something ought to be done along those lines.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: The situation between the Poles and the
                        Lithuanians is another reason why something should be done. There have been
                        demarcations imposed on them several times, but still that can only stave
                        off trouble. I think that unless there is a kind of a provisional fixing of
                        a frontier, those two nations are going to get into serious fighting pretty
                        soon.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Any observations? (Addressing Capt.

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: He certainly has not a monopoly on that

                    <p>VII. Memorandum No. 547 regarding the payment of expenses to be incurred by
                        Colonel Masteller in the administration of his duties, namely, subsistence
                        in Paris, clerical assistance and travelling expenses, was read. <seg

                    <p>General Bliss observed that the duty of the Commission on which Colonel
                        Masteller was to act as American representative was to draw up a plan for
                        the co-operation of the Allied Armies in the work of clearing up munitions
                        and war material left in the liberated regions and to submit the plan to the
                        Supreme Council. It was not intended that the Commission should be in charge
                        of doing the work of clearing up liberated regions.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners were quite willing to furnish Colonel Masteller with living
                        accommodations in the Hotel Crillon, but they were not prepared to defray
                        the other expenses enumerated in the memorandum under consideration. General
                        Bliss undertook to see Colonel Masteller and explain the matter to him.</p>

                    <p>I. The Commissioners discussed with Professor Coolidge the status of the
                        question of the disposition of Western Thrace and particularly the drafting
                        of a telegram to the State Department in the light of the situation created
                        by the confidential telegram received that morning from Mr. Lansing
                        transmitting the President’s views in the matter. <seg type="margin">Western

                    <p>II. Mr. McNeir submitted a report on the Personnel of the Mission in

                    <p>Mr. McNeir explained that the lists of personnel as regards the names of
                        enlisted men were subject to <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0423"
                        />change. He also stated that the Embassy was trying to establish a courier
                        service making Paris a clearing house for missions in the continent of
                        Europe. He expected to have definite information in a day or so.</p>
                    <p>Mr. McNeir brought up the question of the assignment of a medical officer to
                        take the place of Major McKenna. The Commission thought it well to have a
                        regular officer assigned to take his place. Mr. McNeir called attention to
                        the case of Captain Hornbeck and the case of Captain Paul Chapin. The
                        decision in these two cases rested with the Secretary General.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners approved Mr. McNeir’s recommendations regarding the

                        Transport Service, etc., etc., also the retention of Captain Chenay on the

                        of the wishes of the Conference, was read and noted by the Commissioners:

                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“It was originally proposed in the Treaties with Austria and Hungary
                                to impose a liability to make reparation payments on all of the
                                portions of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, including those to
                                be transferred to Allied States. In response to the urgent
                                representations of the Allied States in question, the Principal
                                Allied and Associated Powers agreed to forego their admitted right
                                to secure indemnity from all portions of the former Austro-Hungarian
                                Empire, upon the Allied States which were to acquire former
                                Austro-Hungarian territory agreeing to make a moderate contribution
                                toward the costs of the war of liberation. Mr. Antonesco, Roumanian
                                plenipotentiary at Paris, on June 27, 1919, signed an agreement,
                                subject to the formal approval of his Government, whereby Rumania
                                undertook to make such a contribution. In order further to
                                facilitate such payment by Rumania the Principal Allied and
                                Associated Powers agreed that the amount of this contribution would
                                not actually be payable by Rumania but would be discharged by
                                offsetting the same against reparation to which Rumania was
                                entitled. This is contemplated by the agreement signed by Mr.
                                Antonesco, which further states ‘no further payments on account of
                                reparation shall be made until the other states to whom reparation
                                is due shall have received payments on account of a like proportion
                                of their approved claims for reparation.’ Rumania, accordingly, by
                                this agreement, which she has signed is entitled to no reparation
                                until the other Allied and Associated Powers have received out of
                                the common assets of the enemy sums which bear the same proportion
                                to their total claims as contribution from Rumania bears to the
                                total of Rumanian claims.</p>
                            <p>The action of Rumania in endeavoring to appropriate the assets of
                                Hungary under the guise of securing reparation payments is in clear
                                violation of the agreement signed by Mr. Antonesco and accordingly
                                restores to the Principal Allied and Associated Powers entire

                        $200 per month and that she be assiatant to Mr. Nielsen’s office was
                        read.</p>
                    <p>In view of the fact that Miss Ryder was understood to be a British subject,
                        the Commissioners were not prepared to approve this recommendation. <seg

                        Wright of the American Relief Administration in regard to a report that the
                        French were planning to take over the A. R. A. wire between Paris and

                        that the Department’s telegram did not refer to any telegram from the

                    <p>The Commissioners felt that it would not be worth while to have Colonel

                        to Mr. John Foster Dulles for a number of records of the Conference, and in
                        particular the minutes of the Commission on the Execution of the Treaty with
                        Germany, was read. <seg type="margin">Mr. Fosdick Request Records of the
                            Conference</seg></p>
                    <p>In view of the fact that the Treaty had not yet been ratified by the United
                        States Senate, and in view of the fact that none of the minutes of the
                        Conference Commissions had as yet been made public, Mr. Polk disapproved Mr.
                        Fosdick’s request for copies of any documents which had not been
                        communicated to the Senate, and which were still treated as confidential. In
                        any case, the consent of the Secretary of State would have to be secured by
                        Mr. Fosdick before he could be furnished with any confidential Conference
                        documents.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Admiral, have you anything?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: Nothing in particular, sir. Nothing
                        except what I sent to you.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: There is nothing further on that question
                        of the distribution of ships?</p>
                    <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0427"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: I telegraphed some days ago to the
                        department, and inquired whether the War and Navy Departments could get
                        together and settle on some scheme. I wanted to know in particular about the
                        air craft.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: There is no question about the submarines
                        at all? It is perfectly clear that they are to be destroyed?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: Not all have agreed to that.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Didn’t they all agree to the destruction
                        of the submarines?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: No.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: The British did not?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: Yes, the British agreed to the
                        destruction. The only people holding out are the French. And there is that
                        unfortunate misunderstanding about the Scapa Flow incident.</p>
                    <p>I telegraphed Washington for a little more definite information about the
                        aircraft, whether we are permitted to leave what we don’t want in the pool,
                        or whether the message applied to aircraft too. It was so written that
                        apparently it only applied to ships.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: In connection with the blockade question
                        which we discussed yesterday, is it your understanding that they are going
                        to make any announcement on that?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: From here?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: No, I shouldn’t think we could do
                        that until the governments have been approached. The whole thing is just a
                        matter of beating the devil around the stump. By the time anything can be
                        done it will be too late. So I think the proper thing will be to get
                        together and look wise, but I don’t anticipate there is going to be any
                        great result from it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Does anyone know how Scott and Morley are
                        getting along with the draft?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: The Coordinating Committee met
                        yesterday morning. They met this morning, and meet again this afternoon.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: All the other committees are through?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: With the reply to Austria, yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. A. W. Dulles</hi>: The Nationality Clauses are still
                        outstanding. Drafts have been prepared by the Drafting Committee, but they
                        have to go to the Supreme Council for approval before the reply is given the
                        Austrians. They cannot reply on the basis of these clauses until they are
                        passed upon by the Supreme Council.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: What did the Council decide on that,
                        Mr. Harrison?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: It was agreed yesterday that
                        everything was to go to the Coordinating Committee.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Who sits on the Drafting Committee for
                        us?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: James Brown Scott.</p>
                    <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0428"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Doesn’t Dr. Scott sit on the Coordinating
                        Committee?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: No.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: The Coordinating Committee will get a
                        report from us which consists of the work being done by the Drafting
                        Committee.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Have you anything? (Addressing Mr.
                        Dresel.)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Dresel</hi>: No, sir.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: I may as well report progress on one or
                        two questions in regard to Teschen. The members that have been sitting on
                        that commission reached a unanimous decision yesterday, which will go to the
                        Supreme Council at once. That part of the mining region where the Polish
                        majority is so overwhelming, and the feeling of the population so intense
                        against the Czechs, it seems rather unwise to recommend that that go to
                        Czecho-Slovakia. It will leave about sixty percent of the coal produced in
                        Teschen on the Czech side.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: How about the railroad?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: It will be cut into in several places,
                        although it will leave to the Czechs the possibility—by building a small
                        line of about twelve kilometers—of getting a double track line from the
                        mining district, through the Jablunitza Pass to the frontier. It will take
                        in to Poland about ten thousand Czechs living in that territory, and would
                        give about three-fourths of the Poles that live in Teschen to Poland. In
                        case the Supreme Council accepts this frontier, it is proposed that it then
                        authorize the Commission to negotiate with the Czechs and Poles about
                        economic arrangements which may be made and put into the Treaty to ensure
                        the interests of the Czechs in regard to railway communications and coal. It
                        seemed to the Commission that when it came to a question of comparing the
                        rights of the people with the question of coal, that the people came
                        first.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Have you anything, Colonel Grant?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel Grant</hi>: No, sir, excepting several things
                        that are a little bit in suspense about Thrace. I think the Ports and
                        Waterways Clauses will have to be changed a little bit.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I see one French paper yesterday favored
                        our solution. Have you anything else? (Addressing Mr. Harrison.)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: No, sir.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: When do you think the Austrian Treaty is
                        going to be ready?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: It depends on what the Coordinating
                        Committee does with the proceedings of yesterday. If the French draft goes
                        through, they might be ready by Friday or Saturday. If there are too many
                        annexes, and if Mr. Balfour brings it up in the Supreme Council, it will
                        take three months.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I think you are reasonably safe in
                        eliminating that last proposition; Mr. Balfour leaves on the 30th.</p>
                    <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0429"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel Grant</hi>: One other little thing, and that is
                        this matter of shipments of material from other countries into
                        Serbo-Croatia. The present arrangement is that shipments are temporarily
                        suspended until a decision is reached as to how much should be shipped and
                        how much should not; and that awaits a decision as to whether anything is to
                        be done definitely about a limitation of armaments in those countries. And
                        in the meantime shipments have stopped, and of course the Italians have by
                        that means gotten just exactly what they started out to get; prevented
                        shipments from going in.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: They will do everything they can to
                        prevent the shipment of railroad material.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel Grant</hi>: We are interested on account of that
                        railroad material, and things of that kind.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: Mr. Tittoni wanted that put off the
                        agenda until M. Clemenceau gets here. He is supposed to be here
                        tomorrow.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: After the Austrians are given the
                        Treaty they will have to take it back to Vienna, and that alone would take
                        five days. It has got to be approved by the Austrian Assembly, and the
                        Orient Express takes at least two and one-half days each way, so the fact
                        that they have to take it to Vienna will mean an additional 5 days.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: They will ask for an extension.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. A. W. Dulles</hi>: The Committee on New States has
                        four treaties in advanced state of preparation. The Czecho-Slovak treaty has
                        already been presented to the Supreme Council. It is proposed that it be
                        signed at the same time as the Austrian Treaty is signed, inasmuch as the
                        Polish Treaty was signed at the same time as was the German Treaty. The
                        Rumanians have made no observations. They object to clauses relative to the
                        Protection of Minorities in the Austrian Treaty. And then there are also the
                        treaties for the Serb-Croat-Slovene State. The last two are not quite ready,
                        but the Czech Treaty is practically completed.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: In connection with the Rumanian
                        attitude just mentioned, Mr. Dulles sent me a dispatch from our Chargé
                        d’Affaires at Bucharest, reporting a conversation with Mr. Bratiano. Mr.
                        Bratiano in that conversation said that Rumania would refuse to accept the
                        boundary line with Hungary assigned to her by the Conference. They would
                        insist upon the boundary line of August 1916.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. A. W. Dulles</hi>: In the Treaty with Austria they
                        are obligated to sign a provision for the Protection of Minorities. Rumania
                        objects most strenuously.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Nielsen spoke of the treaty of 1839 between Belgium and Holland; that he
                        had no instructions whatever as to what position to take in connection with
                        the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Meeting adjourned at 2:55 p.m.</p>

                            Washington</hi>, Brest, France, August 23, with which General McCoy
                        submitted a draft telegram to be sent by the Mission to Dr. Katissian,
                        President of the Armenian Republic, requesting certain definite information

                        the information desired by General Harbord and to deliver the same to the
                        General upon his arrival.</p>
                    <p>V. The Secretary read a communication addressed by Dr. George D. Herron under
                        date of August 16 to the American Minister at Berne requesting an opinion of
                        Mr. Stovall as to whether it would be proper for him to come to Paris as an
                        official delegate of the Macedonians to present their claims to the Peace

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: No, everything is fairly clear.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Your decks are clear, are they?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: The distribution of ships seems to
                        be in the background. The aircraft matter is pretty well settled now.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: That ship question has not put its head
                        up at all recently, has it?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: No, it really hasn’t. I don’t know
                        what the result will be. I don’t know any basis of distribution. If we could
                        only persuade our French friends to have a change of heart.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: They have put out quite a bit of
                        propaganda. They say they had no people to work at shipbuilding during the
                        war; that all their men were in the army; therefore the United States and
                        Great Britain, because they were able to have men in their shipyards, were
                        able to build ships, while the French were not able to do so.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: That fortunately, does not rest on
                        my devoted head.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I have expected Clemenceau to bring it
                        up, but he hasn’t mentioned it. I know he and Balfour had it up.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: I might possibly mention some of
                        those dispatches about depredations that have taken place in the Italian
                        zone down there, the way they have treated the Yugo-Slavs, and all that. The
                        Fiume question has been settled, hasn’t it?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Yes, Tittoni accepted everything.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: He couldn’t do anything else,
                        considering the way that was arrived at.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Have you anything further?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: No, sir, I haven’t got
                        anything.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Woolsey</hi>: No.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Dr. Lord?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: A report has just been sent in on Teschen
                        to the Supreme Council, and our report on Eastern Galicia has also gone in
                        now, I understand.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Is that Galician report apt to make
                        trouble? The Teschen report is.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: The Teschen report is a unanimous report
                        by the Commission. It will doubtless arouse a considerable amount of
                        criticism from the Czechs, and, to a less extent, from the Poles. The
                        Galician <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0433"/>report is not unanimous,
                        with regard to three of the articles of the proposed treaty, where the
                        British have made minority proposals. I suppose that that may lead to some
                        discussion. And then I understand that the Polish Delegation has sent in a
                        memorandum to the Council requesting, or demanding, a change with regard to
                        one of the most cardinal features of the treaty, namely, the one which
                        provides that some time in the future there must be a plebiscite or some
                        other kind of consultation of the inhabitants of Eastern Galicia.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: No, sir.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Major Tyler</hi>: No, sir.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel Grant</hi>: I think it would be advisable for
                        the Supreme Council, at its meetings, to go over the previous day’s
                        resolutions and decide if they are correct or not. As to the proceedings at
                        the present time, it is a little bit difficult to tell which side of the
                        hill you stop on.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: This morning the Council didn’t know what
                        they decided day before yesterday.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel Grant</hi>: But it wouldn’t take very long to go
                        over this and settle the question immediately, because the work of the other
                        commissions is dependent upon the exact wording of the resolutions.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: We will do that tomorrow.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Capt. Chapin</hi>: It might be well to get the British
                        representative to agree not to finally print the minutes until they have
                        been reviewed at the next meeting. Have the carbon copies that are
                        circulated sufficient for the 24 hours intervening.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Do they print them?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Capt. Chapin</hi>: They run them off and then they Roneo
                        them. And sometimes they are not decided; they say, “we will make that
                        definite tomorrow morning”. In the meantime somebody at the British asks for
                        a copy at once, and then, they run them off, and then it is a question of
                        getting out a corrigendum. If they wait 24 hours until they are approved at
                        the next meeting it would make more accurate and better looking minutes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: When do you think we are going to get
                        through with this Austrian Treaty?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Woolsey</hi>: It will require at least two more
                        sessions of the Supreme Council.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Isn’t it possible to eliminate some of
                        those questions?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Woolsey</hi>: There are two things that remain. One
                        is the examination of the covering note; that will have to be gone over
                        carefully. The other thing is the point I want to make as to whether these
                        reports of the various commissions have been regarded as a sufficient
                        interpretation. I think it is very important to us. The treaty will have to
                        go to the Senate. We will be bound. And perhaps <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398"
                            facs="0434"/>these other countries, if they do not understand that we
                        are bound will think we do not understand that anybody is bound, and that
                        they are not bound. Those are the only two points.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Are the British or French raising the
                        question? Has that been raised with them?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Woolsey</hi>: Yes. They don’t know what to think
                        about it. They have expressed no opinion, although it has been raised quite
                        a few times. They all shake their heads and claim they do not know.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: It is only a question now of the way we
                        are going to consider Austria—that is the only question now—whether as a new
                        state.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Woolsey</hi>: Yes, that will come up in the covering
                        letter.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Only in the covering letter—</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Woolsey</hi>: That is a point in the covering
                        letter; I have raised it as a point. It will come up in connection with the
                        covering letter. There is a question there whether the clause in the
                        preamble of the Treaty shall stand or be removed. It now reads: “Austria is
                        recognized as a new and independent state under the name of the Republic of
                        Austria”, and the phrase, “as a new and independent state” seems to me to be
                        fraught with embarrassments. I don’t think it adds anything to the Treaty; I
                        think it is quite gratuitous; I think it is contrary to the theory of the
                        Treaty. I think it might give Austria a handle to try to absolve herself
                        from some things. My suggestion would be to leave out the clause: “as a new
                        and independent state”, or leave the whole sentence out. Up above here we
                        describe Austria; we call her the Republic of Austria.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: I think that is sound.</p>
                    <p>The meeting adjourned at 2:30 p.m.</p>

                    <p>I. The Secretary stated that Capt. Chapin was willing on being demobilized to
                        be employed by the mission on a salary equivalent to that which he now
                        received as a captain, viz, $220 per month, and that he would be prepared to
                        remain with the mission until about October 20 as he would have to be in the
                        United States by the first of November. <seg type="margin">Retention of

                    <p>The Commissioners expressed their pleasure on hearing the foregoing and

                        and his employment by the mission on the terms as stated above and as is
                        usual in such cases.</p>
                    <p>II. The Commissioners approved the release of Mr. Mr. Fenstermacher so as to
                        enable him to return to the United States as stated in Memorandum 555. <seg

                    <p>Meeting resumed at 3:30 p.m.</p>
                    <p>V. Mr. Dresel stated that it was necessary to keep in close touch with the
                        work of the Organization Commission of the Commission on Reparations and
                        recommended that a suitable person be assigned to him to act as his
                        representative on the secretariat of the afore-mentioned commission. Mr.
                        Dresel suggested the name of Lt. Moseley. <seg type="margin">Assistant to
                            Mr. Dresel on the Secretariat of the Organization Commission of the

                    <p>General Bliss questioned the desirability of apparitions pointing an American
                        in such a capacity.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners approved Mr. Dresel’s recommendation and requested him to
                        examine further into the qualifications of Lt. Moseley for the duty in
                        question.</p>
                    <p>VI. Mr. Dresel stated that a request had been received from the Secretary
                        General for the appointment of two American representatives on the
                        sub-committee of the Committee on Execution of the Treaty clauses. The
                        sub-committee was to be charged with the duty of organizing the Territorial
                        Commissions under the Treaty with Germany in conjunction with the Central
                        Geographical Committee. Mr. Dresel questioned the desirability of appointing
                        American representatives on this sub-committee and requested the
                        Commissioners’ instructions. (See Memorandum No. 557.) <seg type="margin"

                    <p>The Commissioners considered that it was improper for the United States to
                        take part in the organization of Territorial Commissions under the Treaty
                        and disapproved the appointment of the American representatives in
                        question.</p>
                    <p>VII. The Commission heard Lt. Col. Dawley of the Field Mission to the Baltic
                        provinces on the situation in Lithuania, Latvia and <pb n="400"
                            xml:id="pg_400" facs="0436"/>Esthonia. Colonel Dawley also explained at
                        length his views regarding the actions which in his opinion should be taken
                        to support the Esthonian Government and prevent the spread of Bolshevism.

                        application for termination of his connection with the Mission on September
                        30 with the understanding that he would leave Paris in time to reach New

                    <p>Mr. Polk pointed out that he was himself opposed to granting Dr. Johnson’s
                        release from duty with the Mission, but in view of the fact of Dr. Johnson’s
                        insistence that he should be relieved in time to reach <pb n="402"

                    <p>The Commissioners approved Dr. Johnson’s release as stated in memorandum
                        mentioned above.</p>

                    <p>I. The Commissioners approved the final list to be sent to the Secretariat
                        General of the Peace Conference in response to their letter of the 7th
                        August, regarding plaques to commemorate the work of the Peace Conference.

                        salary equal to the remuneration he now receives as a captain in the Army.
                        The Commissioners also approved Captain Yale’s request for a week’s leave of
                        absence, commencing September 4. <seg type="margin">Employment of Captain

                    <p>IV. In regard to the request of certain American newspaper correspondents for
                        permission to send their mail reports by pouch from points in Central
                        Europe, the Commissioners decided that the American newspaper correspondents
                        in question should be informed that couriers would carry their reports if
                        sent unsealed in a special bag, which would be provided for that purpose.

                    <p>As regards the use of the Commission’s wires by American press
                        correspondents, the Commissioners decided that they should be permitted to
                        send a restricted number of words per day from those points where there was
                        no local censorship in force. For instance, as there was a censorship
                        established by the Roumanians in Budapest they could not be sent from there,
                        but they might send their messages to Vienna, from whence they could be sent
                        on to Paris.</p>

                        from Captain Madison at Archangel, in which he says that everybody will

                        other man are going to stay, but they expect to leave on the 7th, and I have

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: All right, you might bring it up now.</p>

                        several things from Fiume. One is about conscription in the American zone by
                        the Serbs. They are using conscription down there. I spoke to you about it,
                        as you remember.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: And we told them to stop it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Remind me of it, and I will bring it up
                        again tomorrow.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: And then he speaks of some very
                        cruel and unusual punishments that have been given down there in the Italian
                        zone, showing the attitude of the Italian people. I got a very interesting
                        report from him, which is too long to read … he said they did not have even
                        enough schools in Italy for the better classes. And then he is very much
                        concerned about an article which appeared in the London <hi rend="italic"
                            >Times</hi>, but I was speaking with Dr. Johnson about that, and he said
                        that his fears about that were groundless.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: What was that question in regard to the
                        neutral zone you spoke to me about this morning?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: And then there is a question of us
                        being authorized by the Conference here to mark out a neutral zone between
                        the Italians and the Serbs. They are continually having clashes down there
                        of one kind and another: the Serbs accuse the Italians of coming over into
                        their zone, and vice versa, and I guess they are both right, and his idea
                        was that as a rank outsider and a neutral in the thing, it might be a good
                        thing if he could be authorized to mark out a neutral zone.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Who would authorize him to do that? The
                        Council?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: I should think so.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Will you give me a memorandum on those
                        two things and I will bring them up tomorrow.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: I will, sir. And then there is just
                        one other thing. He has written me about the candidates for the position of
                            <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0441"/>head of that new mission that
                        is recommended by the Commission of Four Generals in Fiume, and he said that
                        rumor has it down there that there are three candidates: one is General
                        Watts, who was the British member of that Generals’ Commission; the other is
                        General Gordon, who was the head of the British Mission there in Fiume—I
                        don’t know just exactly what that was; that is new to me—and the third is
                        Lt. Col. Peck, who is the present member. …</p>

                        Supreme Council can get the geographic clauses put into shape for the Treaty
                        with Bulgaria, and the southern boundary of Thrace, and the matter of the
                        Dobrudja, and then if the Supreme Council can consider, either itself, or
                        refer to a proper committee the Greek clauses, the Bulgarian Treaty can be
                        finished almost immediately.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Are there any Greek Clauses?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Some time ago there was laid before the
                        Drafting Committee the clauses which the Greeks would like to have inserted
                        in the Treaty.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Are those two economic clauses?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: I can’t state what they were.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Because if they were, there were some
                        suggestions that came from the Greeks this morning.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: I think they are clauses relating to
                        reciprocal immigration, which will be considered tomorrow.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: We disposed of the economic clauses this
                        morning.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: At that time the draft we received
                        contained some thirty or forty-odd articles. Now if that whole section can
                        be gotten <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0442"/>out of the way, and the
                        geographical boundaries, the treaty can be completed immediately.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: You raised a question here which was
                        raised this morning: the question in regard to Dobrudja. In view of the
                        present attitude of the Roumanians, of course it is obviously impossible to
                        negotiate about that. Is it your understanding that the Bulgarian Treaty
                        cannot go forward without the rectification of the Dobrudja line?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: I can’t say what the political effect
                        would be, but as for the draft of the treaty, there would naturally have to
                        be a completed boundary.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: The point has been made: the present
                        boundary of Bulgaria could be described as the boundary. Now the Dobrudja
                        question is a question to be settled with a friendly state—that is,
                        Roumania, presumably friendly, and therefore that could properly be in a
                        separate treaty. It is obvious at the present moment that Roumania would not
                        discuss that question unless she were given compensation in Bessarabia. Now
                        I understand the position of the Delegation has been, before I came here,
                        that we could promise them nothing in Bessarabia; that that is part of
                        Russia, and that therefore we would not be a party to the disintegration of
                        Russia. Is it your understanding, Dr. Johnson, that the Dobrudja
                        rectification would necessarily have to be a part of the Bulgarian
                        Treaty?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Johnson</hi>: I don’t see why it is not possible to
                        complete the frontier of Bulgaria, putting in the Treaty some statement to
                        the effect that the problem of the Dobrudja should be made the subject of a
                        special provision later. I don’t know whether we can take it up or not. The
                        position of the American Delegation on the Territorial Commission was—and it
                        was supported by Mr. Lansing and later by the President—that although
                        Roumania was a friendly state we had a right to require the cession of the
                        Bulgarian portion of the Dobrudja to Bulgaria, in view of the fact that we
                        were giving to Roumania very large areas of territory which were acquired as
                        the result of the common victory of the Allies, not by the Roumanians’ own
                        efforts. That point of view was not supported by the British or the
                        Italians, who took the position that Roumania being a friendly state, we
                        could require no cession of territory. But our position has been that while
                        we may not require outright cession of territory, we will say that “we will
                        give you territory if you cede that.”</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>. Aren’t we more or less blocked? We cannot
                        give them Bessarabia.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Johnson</hi>: But even outside the question of
                        Bessarabia, there is Transylvania.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: There is Transylvania, of course.</p>
                    <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0443"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Johnson</hi>: Where the Territorial Commission gave
                        Roumania territory at the expense of Hungary. They were treated very
                        generously.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: But they made no deal at that time.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Johnson</hi>: No, but it has not been approved, as
                        finally settled, I understand. We are still in the position of saying when
                        the Treaty has been negotiated, that while in general their frontiers have
                        passed the preliminary stages, “We can give you that if you are willing to
                        cede. We will give you that territory if you will cede the Bulgarian
                        territory to Bulgaria.” We can make a Treaty on that basis. Now if you are
                        not going to deal with Roumania because of the present attitude in these
                        questions—</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Roumania is going to deal with us.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Johnson</hi>: (Continuing) Well, whichever it
                        happens to be—it makes it rather difficult to use that means of securing the
                        cession of the Dobrudja. I don’t see what we can do other than frame some
                        article in the Treaty which will show that we intend to take up the Dobrudja
                        question when we make the treaty with Roumania.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: On that theory, Mr. Polk, we can have a
                        general clause to the effect that the Allied and Associated Powers reserve
                        the right to consider at some ultimate time the disposition which would
                        ultimately and in justice and equity be made of the Dobrudja.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: (Addressing Mr. Harrison) Didn’t that
                        question come up this morning?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Harrison</hi>: Yes, sir.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: The British recommended that we proceed,
                        and leave out the question of the Dobrudja, that is, not attempting to draw
                        a new line, and it was agreed to by all except myself, and I reserved,
                        because I understood that Mr. Lansing had always been very strong for giving
                        that part of the Dobrudja properly belonging to Bulgaria, to Bulgaria. Now,
                        in view of the present attitude of Roumania, it would be a waste of time to
                        attempt to draw the line. We certainly do not want to put ourselves into the
                        position of being turned down. So don’t you think it would be quite
                        consistent to so draft the Treaty that that question could be left open to
                        be disposed of later on by the Allied and Associated Powers?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Yes, but if you are going to consider
                        the question as subject to reconsideration at some future time, there should
                        be, I think, an apt clause of that kind in the Treaty.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Yes, I agree with you, but then we could
                        take it up in the Hungarian Treaty.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Then, Mr. Polk, do you think it
                        advisable to have considered at the earliest meeting possible the various
                        Greek clauses, so that that might be put in form for the Treaty?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0444"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: And at the same time would you take up
                        in the Supreme Council the question of the reservation on the part of the
                        Principal Allied and Associated Powers?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: On Bessarabia, yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: No, not on Bessarabia; on the
                        Dobrudja.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: On Dobrudja, yes. If you will let me have
                        the suggestions, I will bring them up.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: (Addressing Mr. Woolsey) Have you
                        anything to bring up?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Woolsey</hi>: Our Committee has finished its work
                        and [is] waiting for the next thing to do.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: Nothing except to point out one
                        thing in connection with what we have been saying about Bessarabia.
                        Bessarabia was one of the points mentioned in the memorandum which was
                        approved by the President.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: He did not go so far as to actually say
                        to award it to Roumania.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: No, but that very principle would
                        allow the discussion.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I think it would be a mistake to go into
                        discussion with Roumania; they are holding an election there. (Addressing
                        Dr. Johnson) Dr. Johnson, have you had anything in regard to the

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Johnson</hi>: No, I have not.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: That has to be very carefully

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Johnson</hi>: He was not. I have asked for an

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I pointed out this morning that that
                        telegram they asked me to send the President was incomplete inasmuch as it
                        does not set out any plan; Venizelos is not getting all he thinks he is
                        entitled to, but does not offer any suggestion for the President to
                        accept.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Johnson</hi>: I have not seen the draft of that

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Well, Eastern Thrace is tied up with
                        Constantinople, and practically being administered now from Constantinople
                        (as I understand, all of Eastern Thrace) by the International body that is
                        there. Now we can make no objection to their sending in troops other than
                        Greek troops into West Thrace, if they offer to.</p>

                        anything?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: I might call your attention to the
                        fact that this treaty governing certain questions between the new states
                        will probably be laid before you soon with report. We have explained to Mr.
                        Lansing the reason why the reservation was made that he should sign,
                        indicating briefly the very urgent desire of most of the delegates of the
                        other powers that we do sign. I presume in the absence of instructions from
                        him to the contrary we will stand on the reservations as made in the
                        committee, that we won’t sign because the treaty embraces local
                        questions.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I will keep that consideration off as
                        long as I can, because in the Secretary’s mind, and in the mind of the
                        Department there is no reason why we should sign; they see no reason why we
                        should sign. Until we get a satisfactory answer to the last telegram I think
                        we should not sign.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: I think you will soon have before you
                        the Spitzbergen Treaty, but inasmuch as we incur no obligations under it, I
                        don’t think that will be very serious.</p>
                    <p>This Belgium-Holland Treaty Commission may make a preliminary report to you.
                        I would like to talk with you a little more in detail about that.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Well, that belongs to the State
                        Department rather than to the Conference.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Woolsey</hi>: Will the Serbian attitude delay the

                    <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0446"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Woolsey</hi>: They want to see it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: That is a very natural curiosity on their
                        part. Have you anything, Mr. Dresel?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Dresel</hi>: I will say that I think the Committee
                        on Repatriation of Prisoners has practically finished its labors. There seem
                        to be left only the practical questions involving the handling by General
                        Connor and he is going to arrange with the French that they will start at
                        once to carry back the prisoners. There seem to be no obstacles except the
                        possible difficulty in getting rolling stock, and it may be necessary to get
                        the Germans to help with rolling stock. The British have their own rolling
                        stock, so they are not up against that difficulty, but we have not, so it is
                        a question of depending more or less on the French, but I don’t think there
                        will have to be any more meetings on that.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: How will they go?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Dresel</hi>: By train. I think it is open to
                        question whether some of them cannot march over the road. I think General
                        Connor is going to take that question up.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: March some of them?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Dresel</hi>: March some of them, yes. But I think we
                        were all agreed that they should be gotten out at the earliest moment
                        possible, and General Connor is rushing the matter ahead.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Woolsey</hi>: Has any section of the Bulgarian
                        Treaty been handed in now?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I think it is practically complete,
                        except the two boundaries, and those questions raised by Dr. Scott. That is
                        what the British representative said this morning.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: I should say also that the Hungarian
                        Treaty is practically five-sixths in type.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prof. Coolidge</hi>: Everything ready but the
                        Hungarian.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Well, see if we cannot expedite them.
                        Have you anything, Dr. Lord?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: I should like to raise one question about
                        Dantzig. The long delay about the entry into force of the peace with Germany
                        has been particularly inconvenient for the Dantzig people and for the Poles,
                        who are expecting some day to have arrangements made with Dantzig which are
                        extremely important for them. The Dantzigers have already been more or less
                        cast off by Germany, and they have not the faintest idea of what is going to
                        become of them under the new arrangement, and apparently they are getting
                        extremely impatient to have some things settled, and the Poles are also
                        extremely anxious to get their economic privileges and rights at Dantzig
                        settled as early as possible so that regular business relations can be
                        established to Dantzig with the outside world.</p>
                    <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0447"/>
                    <p>And I ought also to say that the German Delegation here has presented a
                        letter to the President of the Peace Conference raising a number of
                        important and rather puzzling questions about the interpretation of the
                        Treaty with regard to Dantzig. It seems to me that everything that can
                        legally and fairly b&amp; done to clear up the Dantzig situation ought to be
                        done at as early a date as possible. And there is one thing which I think
                        could and ought to be considered rather quickly. The peace with Germany
                        provides that the Free City of Dantzig shall be organized only at the same
                        time as the Treaty between Dantzig and Poland goes into force, and that
                        Treaty between Dantzig and Poland is to regulate the whole series of
                        relations—political and economic—between the Free City and the Polish
                        State.</p>
                    <p>Now the negotiation and drafting of the Treaty between Dantzig and Poland is
                        a matter reserved for the Allied and Associated Powers; it is not for the
                        League of Nations; it is not for the High Commissioner who will some day
                        represent the League of Nations down there. Now, since the Dantzig state
                        cannot be organized until the Polish-Dantzig Treaty is drafted by the Allied
                        and Associated Powers, and since there will be nothing fixed or settled
                        about Dantzig until the Free City is organized and until its relations with
                        Poland are definite, I wonder whether the Allied and Associated Powers could
                        not set somebody to work at once to draft the treaty between Dantzig and
                        Poland—to do it on the spot, I should suppose—and have it all ready so that
                        it can be signed and go into effect almost as soon as the German Treaty goes
                        into effect.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: No one is working on it now at all?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: No one is working on it now at all.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Suppose you give me a memorandum to that
                        effect.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: I wonder if our domestic situation would
                        render it difficult for us to touch a question like this? I suppose all this
                        could be regarded as a part of the work for the commission now sitting for
                        the execution of the treaty.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I don’t see that it has any bearing on
                        it. It is a question to properly come before the Council for approval, isn’t
                        it?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: Yes, but it would, I think, require the
                        appointment of a commission, which would probably have to go to Dantzig and
                        do its work mainly there, in consultation with the Dantzig city authorities
                        and the Polish government.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: No, we couldn’t do that.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: It seemed to certain people that it was
                        going too far in executing the German Treaty.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: That would come under the ban; anything
                        that hasn’t anything to do with dollars is banned.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: Would it be a situation that Captain
                        Abele of the Navy could handle? Captain Abele is up there.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: He is on duty there?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: He is Naval Attaché to Poland. He is
                        in Dantzig, mainly, and I am getting advices from him periodically, from
                        Dantzig.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: I think that Admiral Knapp’s suggestion
                        could very well be acted upon. I was told this morning that there was a
                        British naval man about to proceed to Poland to organize the Polish navy,
                        and matters relating thereto, and that mission could furnish the British
                        personnel for such a commission, and if we could nominate Captain Abele to
                        sit, I think the work could be done rather quietly, and be all ready to sign
                        the moment the German Treaty goes into effect.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: If you will give me a memorandum I will
                        bring it up and suggest that the informal committee begin sitting and

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: That is a State Department matter.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lt. Col. Greene</hi>: Yes, but it seems to me that it
                        should be brought to the attention of the State Department.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I will bring it to the attention of the
                        State Department if you will give me a memorandum.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Dresel</hi>: It has been. A message was sent about a
                        week ago.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lt. Col. Greene</hi>: That was about the diplomatic
                        service, but not about the consular service.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: No, I quite agree with you. That is up to
                        the Department.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Dresel</hi>: We suggested that consuls be sent to

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: Did you have any discussion about these
                        cars and locomotives in Hungary?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Yes, and there were two very interesting
                        reactions in there. On the question of Alsace-Lorraine the French got up on
                        their hind legs, and then I suggested that it be referred to the proper
                        committee. Mr. Balfour raised this point: under the reparations clauses
                        would the Czecho-Slavs, the Yugo-Slavs, the Italians and the Poles be
                        entitled to railway material that had formerly belonged to those
                        governments? And I suppose there is some question about that.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: If you are going to follow that theory
                        to its logical extreme you can take all the rolling stock that the Poles
                        have got now.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Oh, if they have got it now, no. It was
                        referred to the Reparations Committee.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: It was brought up this morning; they
                        tried to persuade us that no agreement had been reached, but they couldn’t
                        persuade Clemenceau, who lost his temper. Of course that was not the case;
                        he pointed out that they had reached an agreement and there was some
                        political reason for preventing the report being made. We finally had the
                        report made, and then agreed to have both Paderewski and Benes come tomorrow
                        and take it up.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: The Polish miners struck some time ago
                        because the coal they were mining wasn’t going to Poland; they said they
                        wouldn’t work unless the coal went to Poland; and now this morning the
                        Czechs have struck because they won’t work to produce coal to be sent into
                        Poland.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: We are going to try to settle that

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: Then I have got further news. The
                        Germans up there will accept the American occupation in Silesia.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: You go home and persuade the Senate to
                        let us do it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: There is one point about the whole
                        Polish relationship with the Germans in the areas ceded to the Poles. The
                        Germans are stripping them bare, and the Germans are still in occupation;
                        they are so anxious to get the food-stuffs out of those areas that they are
                        hauling off the crops unthreshed, hauling off the green, unthreshed crops,
                        and they are going to leave that place absolutely bare of food-stuffs. I
                        don’t suppose there is any way to expedite the handing of that stuff over to
                        Poland.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: That is in the Treaty of Peace, isn’t
                        it?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: The Germans refuse to feed the City of
                        Dantzig any more from the German general food supplies, or to include it in
                        the German food supplies, and the result is we have persuaded the Poles to
                        feed the City of Dantzig for a time—I don’t know how long that will go on—so
                        the city is going to be in a great deal of trouble.</p>
                    <p>And there is one thing in regard to the Scheldt, in connection with this
                        quarrel between Belgium and Holland. We have been operating a whole lot of
                        boats on the Scheldt, and we have an organization established. The Dutch are
                        undoubtedly doing everything they can to obstruct that commercial situation
                        there.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: What are they doing?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: The Scheldt has silted up during the
                        war, naturally, and there is only about seventeen feet of water. It is
                        impossible to get shipping in to Antwerp with any degree of safety, and the
                        Dutch will not dredge the river, and the Belgians cannot do it, and all in
                        all they have put the city of Antwerp in a very difficult situation, and my
                        own impression is that the Dutch are going to do their best to prejudice <pb

                        deal of sympathy on anything that provides for helping the Belgian
                        situation.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Who did you get that report on the

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Could you ask him to write me a report on
                        that, because I will take that up with the Dutch, who have been talking to
                        me personally, saying that they have been so liberal to Belgium. Now if I
                        have a report of that kind I can make it disagreeable to them, saying that
                        we will throw our sympathy on the side of Belgium.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: There is only one solution, and that is
                        to put the Scheldt under an international commission, because the Dutch, as
                        they have practically control of the improvement of the Scheldt, can always
                        defeat anything that is done at the present moment. The Belgians have the
                        right to call on the Dutch to improve it, but if they do not improve it,
                        nothing can be done about it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: If you will get that report for me I will
                        take it up.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: So when all the rivers around here are
                        being internationalized, that ought to be internationalized also. I have had
                        the Belgians withdraw their territorial aspirations there, and in view of
                        that, the Dutch might agree to that. I think inquiry will establish that
                        there is not more than 17½ feet draft in the river now, whereas it was
                        navigable for steamers up to thirty feet before.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: There is a funny thing about that; I
                        raised the question the other day about the proposed visit of the King of
                        the Belgians to the United States, concerning his going over in one of our
                        ships; I raised the question about the <hi rend="italic">George
                            Washington</hi> going in there and Tardieu assured me it could.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Admiral Benson would not authorize
                        it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I told him that both McCullough and
                        Benson were in doubt about it, but Tardieu assured me that it was deep
                        enough.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Knapp</hi>: When the President left the second
                        time it was proposed that the President go up there and leave from Antwerp,
                        and I had the question examined and found it was not safe for the <hi
                            rend="italic">George Washington</hi> to go up there. Of course she is
                        rather a large ship, but I haven’t any doubt that the river has silted up in
                        these five years.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Johnson</hi>: I think I can get a certain report of
                        the condition of the Scheldt before the war, which shows that the Dutch were
                        placing obstacles in the way of the development of the channel there, making
                        difficulty for the Belgians.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: If we have that information, and tell
                        them that in view of those facts it will be necessary for us to change our
                        position, I think it will have a considerable bearing on the attitude of the
                        Dutch.</p>

                    <p>(Addressing Mr. Hoover) Is that all you have?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: That is all. This Silesian thing seems
                        to have quieted clown. Col. Goodyear has transported 450 German prisoners
                        back to Germany, and gotten out his Poles that were up for execution, but
                        nevertheless that situation is not going to be satisfactory as long as that
                        bunch of German prisoners stay in there.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: Mr. Polk, is there no way of putting
                        pressure on Germany to induce her to accept Allied occupation and not merely
                        American occupation. If the Council can send an ultimatum of fifteen days
                        over an article in the German Constitution, it seems to me that this is at
                        least of as great importance.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: There is no way of getting at it. Every
                        kind of pressure has been brought to bear, economic and everything else, but
                        it is a political question. They are afraid that no man is strong enough to
                        consent to it in Germany today; there is no man strong enough to consent to
                        it who will last 24 hours.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: They would consent to an American
                        occupation.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: They would consent to an American
                        occupation, but not an Allied occupation, for no man could last 24 hours who
                        would consent to it. I think that is perfectly reasonable, for I think that
                        in any country where the statesmen gave up an important part of the
                        country—as Silesia undoubtedly is to them—to Allied occupation, it would not
                        be a question of days, it would be a question of hours before they would be
                        out. But I am sure the British and French both would be very keen for doing
                        it if they can find any excuse for doing so.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: I thought the excuse was furnished; that
                        by their present procedure the Germans are making the plebiscite provided
                        for in the Treaty rather personal. They are already preventing the execution
                        of one of the cardinal items of the Treaty.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: The plebiscite cannot be held under six
                        months after the treaty goes into effect, and may not be held in less than a
                        year and a half. Wouldn’t that be a good time to get the Poles back?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: The Poles will start in as soon as it
                        goes into effect, plus more Poles.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Lord</hi>: There is another fact; that the Germans
                        can arrest anybody for high treason, and sentence them to Magdeburg and bury
                        them for ten years.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: We will cure that when we begin to call
                        for the German punishments. There will be a way found to bring those Poles
                        out. That can be controlled.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Do you mean to say that the German
                        government has consented to the American occupation?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hoover</hi>: I have had a hint to that effect, and
                        Col. Goodyear has been told they would.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral McCully</hi>: I have made a memorandum of the
                        work I have been covering during the last week, for information.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Has the blockade of the Baltic been
                        brought up to you, Admiral?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral McCully</hi>: Nothing has come to my attention
                        in that connection except the decision that I have seen which was taken in
                        the Supreme Council.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: The British representatives have not
                        raised the question at all?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral McCully</hi>: No, sir.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: You haven’t heard anything more from
                        those people, Mr. Woolsey?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Woolsey</hi>: No, sir, not a thing.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Admiral, have you anything further that
                        you want to bring up?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral McCully</hi>: I thought I would mention again
                        the distribution of war material. I have been trying to get all the data in
                        regard to it,—have telegraphed and written for it, but have received no
                        answer. And as the proceedings went on, I decided in accordance with what
                        instructions I had. Apparently they want to make some changes. The officer
                        is arriving tomorrow.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: You want to delay action on that?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral McCully</hi>: I want to delay action on that
                        until I hear what he wants to say.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: The officer who is arriving tomorrow is
                        one of your officers?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral McCully</hi>: Yes, sir. I would like to ask, for
                        my information, in regard to these boards that I go to: what force any
                        resolution that I join in has?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: What boards are they?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral McCully</hi>: In some there is nothing at all
                        going on, but in the Baltic Commission and in the Commission on the
                        Distribution of War Material, and in the Belgian Commission there are
                        questions coming up, and I don’t like to approve the resolutions without
                        knowing how much effect they have.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: The Baltic Commission is not a commission
                        of the Peace Conference, is it?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: Not the Allied Commission; not the
                        one which General Gough is on.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: But there is a Baltic Commission
                        appointed; there is a Baltic Commission sitting. If you will let me have a
                        memorandum I will look it up.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral McCully</hi>: The Baltic Commission which is
                        handling the question of the entrances to the Baltic.</p>
                    <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0455"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Have we anyone sitting on the board?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral MoCully</hi>: There are three army officers
                        there; I do not know if they are members. I did not see any of our
                        representatives that I knew.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Will you let me have a memorandum on
                        that, please. I am going to suggest that everyone hand in a list of the
                        various commissions that they are sitting on (other than, of course, those
                        concerned with the framing of the treaties and things of that kind), and see
                        if we can adjourn those that are just hanging on; clean them up and get them
                        out of the way.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: The man that we had on the Baltic
                        Commission has been withdrawn.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: This Commission is examining the question
                        and is going to report on the ultimate disposition of the Baltic Provinces;
                        on the attitude to be taken. I am not positive, but I think Professor
                        Coolidge was a member of that.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral McCully</hi>: I have information as to what
                        action they want to take, but I don’t know whether to join in that
                        resolution, or simply to be considered as an adviser to this commission.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: The latter is true of most of the
                        commissions we are sitting on now; we are not supposed to have any official
                        representatives on any of these commissions. But if you will let me have a
                        list of the commissions, and if everyone else will do the same, I will take
                        this matter up.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral McCully</hi>: It is stipulated that the Baltic
                        Commission shall not come to any decision in regard to the cession of any
                        territory or international servitude; I would like to ask if that would
                        guide me in any other decisions that might come up, if that same principle
                        should govern me in case some other question came up in regard to that—that
                        is, the Belgian Commission?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: That Belgian Commission has to do with
                        the question of the Scheldt, hasn’t it?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral McCully</hi>: Yes, sir.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Do you sit on that?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral McCully</hi>: I am adviser to our members.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Well, it is a perfectly safe rule to
                        follow, about all these things, I think. Have you anything, Dr. Scott?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Nothing, except what you already know,
                        that as far as the Drafting Committee is concerned, the Treaty with Hungary
                        would be in general complete if it had the Fiume clauses in. I understand
                        that something has happened there recently.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Are you going to put the Fiume matter in
                        the Hungarian Treaty?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: We intended to. There are three
                        paragraphs left which can be entirely covered by the usual one; that Hungary
                        accepts <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0456"/>such disposition as may be
                        made of this and that. And if that is your pleasure, the Treaty is
                        ready.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Well, it is my pleasure as far as it
                        goes, but the Italians do not stay hitched more than 24 hours at a time. If
                        you can settle the Fiume question, and also produce a Hungarian government
                        with which we can treat, you will be doing a great service to your
                        country.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: A large part of the Hungarian Treaty has
                        been decided upon at different intervals by the Supreme Council, and with
                        the general direction that the clauses dealing with various matters should,
                        as far as possible, be based upon the Austrian clauses, it makes it a
                        comparatively simple matter, but that one matter requires to be passed upon.
                        If you care to have it mentioned, there is a space for it. If you would
                        rather have the usual renunciatory clauses, there is no reason why the
                        Hungarian Treaty should in any way wait in respect to the disposition of
                        Fiume.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: As I suggested, it would be very helpful
                        if everyone would hand in to Mr. Grew a list of the committees you are on
                        and matters pending in which they are engaged. I think there are a great
                        many matters sort of dragging around that we ought to either send back to
                        the Foreign Offices as not to be handled by the Peace Conference, or try to
                        see if we cannot dispose of them. So if everyone will hand in a list of the
                        committees you are on and the matters pending we will have it ready for next
                        Wednesday. Have you anything, Colonel?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Col. Embick</hi>: No, sir.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Mr. Nielsen?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: I will mention one thing, which,
                        however, does not concern me: the Secretary-General asked me a little while
                        ago whether we were to be represented on the Supreme Economic Council
                        meeting at Brussels tomorrow.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: We are not.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: I supposed we were not, and I told him
                        so.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Not only because the Senate does not
                        desire it, but I think it would be very bad policy for us at the present
                        moment. It is purely their show.</p>
                    <p>The Bulgarian Treaty will be handed in tomorrow. We had rather an interesting
                        discussion about that. Their first idea was to let only the Council of Five
                        be present, but it was pointed out that that would hardly be fair to the
                        Greeks and the Serbians, who had considered that to be their particular show
                        (or their particular funeral), and therefore they very grudgingly said we
                        would let in the Balkan states, and then it was pointed out that the
                        Belgians would be objecting, and finally they said they would let in the
                        heads of the Delegations, but they did so very grudgingly, with very bad
                        grace.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: What is their point?</p>
                    <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0457"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Their so-called courtesy is very much
                        overestimated. Apparently the Secretary-General objected to it more than
                        anyone else. We were finally able to get every power represented. This they
                        very grudgingly agreed to. And they finally agreed to let ten
                        representatives of the Press come in. As a matter of fact the other small
                        powers seem to resent it more than Bulgaria.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Could you state whether a definite date
                        has been determined upon within which the Bulgarians are expected to answer?
                        I have seen various dates mentioned.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: My recollection is bad on that; I am
                        sorry Mr. Harrison isn’t here. Was it 21 or 25 days? Captain Chapin?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Captain Chapin</hi>: 25 days after presentation.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>. It is entirely too long. I fought for
                        fifteen days. The thing should have been presented to them last week. This
                        thing has been dragged along, and now finally it is to be presented
                        tomorrow, and then they are to be given 25 days. The fact that it will take
                        them fifteen days to get home would indicate that they are going to walk. I
                        can’t understand why it should take them that long.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Woolsey</hi>: I think perhaps it would be well if
                        the Commissioners were advised of a question that Admiral McCully has up in
                        regard to the entrances to the Baltic.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: The which?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Woolsey</hi>: I would rather have the Admiral state
                        it, if he would.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral McCully</hi>: I have copies of the matters that
                        relate to this question, if you will take time to look them over. I have
                        made copies of each one of the questions I have been dealing with, and what
                        has happened to it during the week.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Which particular point do you have in
                        mind, Mr. Woolsey?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Woolsey</hi>: I understand one of these committees
                        on which the Admiral has been sitting—the Admiral has been discussing this
                        point with me—has up now the British proposal to make the entrances to the
                        Baltic available for warships in time of peace and in time of war, so that
                        any country like Denmark or Sweden, which abuts the entrance could not mine
                        the entrances and keep out all ships, as they did during the past war. They
                        want us to join in some declaration to be made by the Council here to that
                        effect. Now all the countries have treaties with Sweden [<hi rend="italic"
                            >Denmark</hi>], I guess—anyway we have treaties covering those
                        entrances, of 1857. The United States has a separate treaty of its own.<note

                        channels shall be open for vessels and their cargoes, and it would seem from
                        the reading of the treaty that it refers to merchant vessels. Now the
                        British would be satisfied if the Treaty was made to read, or understood to
                        read: “merchant vessels and warships”. As far as the United States is
                        concerned, I think it is a matter of negotiation with the countries that are
                        on the Baltic.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: It certainly is not the function of the
                        Peace Conference to pass on that. If it comes up I would be inclined to send
                        it to Washington. That would be your view too, wouldn’t it?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Bliss</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Woolsey</hi>: Did I state the case properly,
                        Admiral?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral McCully</hi>: Yes. I could not quite understand
                        why they should bring up a case of that kind and want some decision right
                        away.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I have discussed this general question of
                        policy with General Bliss and Mr. White and they are agreed that these
                        questions are outside the work of the Peace Conference, and they should be
                        taken up with the various Foreign Offices.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral McCully</hi>: In the last meeting of the
                        Commission on Baltic Affairs a resolution was introduced in regard to this
                        thing, a resolution which had not been seen by any of us, and even the
                        British naval adviser had not seen it before we got it. The Japanese,
                        British and Italians agreed to it; the French said they could not see any
                        objection.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I would like to know what the resolution
                        was, what its scope is. Perhaps we had better have that looked up; in fact
                        we had better look them all up and see what they are.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Woolsey</hi>: It looks as though they wanted the
                        Council here to make a declaration as to the meaning of that Treaty.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: It does not seem to me that that is its
                        function.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Woolsey</hi>: Regardless of the other parties to the
                        Treaty.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I can’t see the system at all. Is there
                        anything else?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: The French issued a suggestion that we
                        should have a meeting on Ports and Waterways with a view to taking up the
                        questions in the Treaty connected therewith, for the League of Nations. Is
                        it desirable that we should take part in that?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: We might sit in as a matter of curiosity,
                        but until we ratify the Treaty we cannot take part.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: It is not under the Treaty.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: But it comes under the League of
                        Nations?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: No, it is proposed to take up and
                        discuss the way in which these international questions of Ports, Waterways
                        and Railways concerning the League of Nations, are to be worked out by the
                        League, when they come up for discussion.</p>
                    <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0459"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lt. Condon</hi>: The French government has issued an
                        invitation, suggesting that our government have a representative who would
                        sit unofficially; in other words, they feel there are a number of those
                        clauses that should be acted upon unofficially until the League of Nations
                        comes into being, and they feel that the same men who have been handling
                        those questions all during the discussion of the treaties here would be the
                        most competent ones to sit in on these discussions.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Dr. Hudson telegraphed that he was
                        coming back.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I don’t think we have a right to be
                        represented on any such committee in the absence of instructions from
                        Washington. Even last winter, when we had invitations to sit on anything not
                        directly connected with the Peace Conference, we did not sit in.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lt. Condon</hi>: But this is a continuation of the Ports
                        and Waterways.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Who is handling that invitation now, do
                        you know?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lt. Condon</hi>: The invitation came through from the
                        French.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Who is handling it here?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: It came to me. M. Itachi, the Japanese,
                        is very much interested in it; he is coming to see me directly.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Why not send it to Washington?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: We had better send a telegram; that is
                        probably the best thing.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lt. Condon</hi>: It was arranged so that the French
                        government send the invitation, in order that it would not seem to come from
                        the Peace Conference at all.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: It had better go to Washington.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Buckler</hi>: May I ask as to the best course to
                        take in regard to the Albanians. They call on us here on an average of three
                        times a week, and they make me very tired, for they are always assuming that
                        there is a chance that we will take the mandate, and I tell them quite
                        vigorously that they had better forget it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: No chance in the world.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Buckler</hi>: I have told them, along the line of
                        General Phillips, that the best thing for them to do is to take the Italian
                        protection; that she is a good friend of Albania, and that that is the best
                        thing they can do. Do you think that is the best thing?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Yes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Buckler</hi>: I was very reluctant to come to that,
                        but that is the best thing I can suggest.</p>
                    <p>I have a feeling that we ought to be arranging about a financial expert
                        familiar with all the intricacies of the Ottoman debt; we ought to be
                        looking forward to having someone ready to serve in that capacity when the
                        Turkish Treaty comes up for discussion. I don’t know personally of any one,
                        but I think someone ought to be selected so he can work up the subject.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Have you anybody in view?</p>
                    <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0460"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Buckler</hi>: I might suggest Mr. Hutchins, the
                        National City Bank man, who has been in Constantinople for two or three
                        months.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: As a matter of fact I think the Turkish
                        Treaty is going to take a different organization from the one we have at
                        present. We don’t need experts on Teschen for that purpose—not that we
                        haven’t an expert at the present moment on Teschen—but there are a good many
                        subjects we haven’t got experts on. But it is rather my view that the
                        Department should be called on to organize a new personnel for that
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Buckler</hi>: That is a very good plan.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I assume that we are not going to touch
                        the Turkish Treaty. Every time they take up anything in regard to Turkey we
                        make the reservation that it is altogether temporary. For instance, with
                        regard to this arrangement that Clemenceau and Lloyd George were discussing,
                        I made it clear several times in the procès verbal that it was in no way
                        binding on the United States, that it was purely temporary, provisional.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Buckler</hi>: Might it not be well to call [to] the
                        Department’s attention that that particular thing is an extremely intricate
                        one, and that it needs a certain amount of preparation?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. White</hi>: Yes, we should. He ought to be down
                        there studying it now.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Buckler</hi>: Yes, or studying the documents and
                        preparing himself.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: If you will prepare a telegram along that
                        line I will send it.</p>
                    <p>Meeting adjourned at 2:50 p.m.</p>

                    <p>[I.] Mr. Polk gave a brief account of what had occurred at the meeting of the

                        the Allies. It had been <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0461"/>agreed to
                        postpone consideration of the Hungarian-Roumanian problem until the arrival
                        of Sir George Clerk. <seg type="margin">Roumanian-Hungarian
                        Situation</seg></p>
                    <p>[II.] The Commissioners discussed the present situation with regard to Fiume,
                        the possible results, the danger of revolution in Italy and the attitude of
                        the Yugo-Slavs with regard to the Franco-British proposal that the city of
                        Fiume should be given to the Italians. <seg type="margin">Fiume</seg></p>
                    <p>[III.] Mr. Polk stated that he had a conversation that morning with Mr.
                        McNeir with regard to the future of the Commission. It appeared that Mr.
                        McNeir had also discussed the matter with Mr. White and General Bliss. <seg
                            type="margin">The Future of the Commission</seg></p>
                    <p>Mr. Polk was inclined to think that the present plant was very large in
                        comparison with the number of persons engaged in Conference work. He
                        believed that a good many matters should from now on be properly left to the
                        foreign offices and handled by the State Department and the Embassy. It
                        might be possible to close up the press room at once and commence the
                        transfer of certain matters to the Embassy. He had requested Mr. McNeir to
                        submit a list of persons who might now be released. Mr. Polk also stated
                        that he understood from Mr. McNeir that it would be impossible to give up
                        the hotel on the first of October as it was necessary to give the owners
                        thirty days’ notice. Consequently, it would be impossible to leave the hotel
                        until November first. On the other hand, a number of persons could be got
                        rid of by October 8 and perhaps by October 25 the Communication Office and
                        such other offices as it was necessary to keep after that date might then be
                        moved into the buildings on the avenue Montaigne or into the Hotel
                        d’Iéna.</p>
                    <p>[IV.] Mr. White stated that the Archbishop of Alessio had called upon him and
                        protested vigorously against the occupation of pation of Koritza and
                        Argyrokastron by Greek forces, should the French troops be withdrawn from
                        Albania. <seg type="margin">Greek Occupation of Koritza</seg></p>
                    <p>(At this point Mr. Polk left the Meeting, having an important
                        engagement.)</p>
                    <p>[V.] The draft of a letter to be addressed to M. Clemenceau pointing out the
                        dangers attending Greek occupation of Western Thrace, was read.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners approved the draft with an amendment proposed by General

                                Inter-Allied occupation of that portion of West Thrace which is to
                                be taken from Bulgaria under the terms of the Treaty of Peace. In
                                the discussion of this question I pointed out to the Council the
                                grave apprehension which I felt in permitting Greek troops to
                                participate in this occupation, but did not consider myself in a
                                position to insist on their entire exclusion, as I felt would have
                                been wise, in view of the non-participation of the United States in
                                this occupation.</p>
                            <p>The formula which was finally accepted contemplates the initial
                                occupation of West Thrace by Allied troops to the exclusion of Greek
                                troops, but leaves it to the discretion of the Commander-in-Chief,
                                General Franchet d’Esperey, eventually to make use of Greek troops
                                exclusively in a restricted and carefully defined zone in the
                                western part of Bulgarian Thrace, which ultimately may be ceded to
                                Greece.</p>
                            <p>I venture to call your attention to this decision of the Council and
                                to emphasize that I consider it of the utmost importance that every
                                precaution should be taken by General Franchet d’Esperey to prevent
                                any violation by Greece of the prescribed zone which may eventually
                                be accorded to her troops of occupation. The unfortunate experiences
                                which the Conference has already had through attempts to create <hi

                                occupations, have led me to bring this matter to your personal

                        a conversation with Mr. Theodorov of the Bulgarian Delegation on September
                        20 was read and noted by the Commissioners; particularly the statement of M.
                        Theodorov, to the effect that he would in all probability ask for a two
                        weeks extension of the 25 days accorded him in which to submit his
                        observations on the terms of Peace. <seg type="margin">Departure of the

                    <p>The Commissioners considered that such an eventuality would be very
                        unfortunate and approved the suggestion that instructions be sent to the
                        Chargé d’Affaires in Sofia to urge the Bulgars to make all haste possible in
                        submitting their reply. It would be to their best interests to have the
                        answer delivered to the Conference before the 25 days were up.</p>

                        now?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: I haven’t a list here, but there are
                        some 23 or 24 treaties in all that were to be prepared; practically they are
                        all done. The only one that is outstanding that requires any work done on it
                        is the Hungarian Treaty. That is waiting on the Council as to whether there
                        shall be a general renunciatory clause concerning Hungarian territory, or
                        articles regarding the relations of Italy to its acquired territory, and I
                        understand there is to be some revision of the articles of reparation and
                        the financial clauses, but with those changes—if any are to be made—the
                        Hungarian Treaty is ready for delivery whenever there is a government to
                        which it is to be delivered.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: The territory in question is more or less
                        dependent on the attitude of Rumania?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Yes, or rather, as far as we are
                        concerned, these matters are dependent upon the action of the Supreme
                        Council.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Why don’t they put them on the agenda?
                        Are they awaiting action?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Of course we cannot do anything in the
                        matter of the financial clauses or the reparation clauses until these
                        various bodies have decided what changes, if any, they intend to make in the
                        text. We have incorporated in those portions of the Hungarian Treaty the
                        articles as they figured in the Austrian Treaty, inasmuch as they were
                        prepared with the idea of being transferred in almost identical terms to the
                        Hungarian Treaty. But that is just lying on the table until such time as the
                        Supreme Council desires to see it and modify or approve it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Would it be possible to adopt the
                        reparation clauses now or do we have to make different provision in case
                        Rumania has taken more than its proportion?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Of course it is for the Allied and
                        Associated Powers to determine what the content of these clauses shall be,
                        and if the Supreme Council should direct the appropriate commission to make
                        changes or to consider what changes should be made in view of that
                        consideration, that could be done, I take it, at almost any time.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Are those clauses ready for action by the
                        Council?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: They would be ready for action—they are,
                        as far as the Drafting Committe can determine the matter, ready for
                        immediate action, but if the clauses are to be modified they can only be
                        modified <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0465"/>either by the Supreme
                        Council directly or by some agent authorized and directed by it to make the
                        necessary changes. But the Treaty is practically all there, unless those
                        clauses are to be changed.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Dresel</hi>: They were passed on by the so-called
                        Reparation Commission, which was empowered to deal with the reparation
                        clauses of the various treaties, and I should think the Supreme Council
                        could refer them back to this Reparation Commission at any time, and they
                        could be reconsidered with a view to the situation in Rumania. That could
                        well be the appropriate action. We took this up with the Reparation
                        Commission three weeks ago—that was before the Hungarian situation became so
                        acute—and I think that it might well be that they could be reconsidered by
                        that Commission now.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: I would like to say, Mr. Polk, that if
                        the Supreme Council will ask, or will direct that we take this action that
                        has been suggested, both with the reparation clauses and with the financial
                        clauses, and if you will give the further direction that the draft treaty,
                        as it now exists, should be changed in that regard, it could be laid before
                        you almost at any time.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Frankly, what I have in mind is this:
                        There is no government in Hungary, and there is no telling when there will
                        be a government in Hungary. Now we do not want to be in a position of
                        sitting around here waiting on their pleasure. The other difficulty is the
                        question of our relations toward Rumania. Now, if our relations with Rumania
                        can be straightened out, it would seem to me that the proper course to
                        pursue would be to draw the clauses in such a way that the Reparations
                        Commission would have power to adjust the so-called “requisition”, or, as we
                        call it, stealing, by the Rumanians; complete the treaty, and then consider
                        that that is as far as we can go in the matter, and just wipe the Hungarian
                        Treaty off the slate, and direct by a protocol, or in some other way,
                        Serbia, Rumania or these countries that are to take over territory, to take
                        over the territory to be assigned to them as theirs, and administer it, and
                        then the new Hungarian state would be in certain bounds, and when they had a
                        government the treaty would be ready for them. It seems absurd to hold up
                        the whole situation waiting for the Hungarian government to be formed when
                        it would be possible to administer this territory in this manner. The
                        question as to which country is to get certain territory can be settled; in
                        each case the territory can be given to the country which is ultimately to
                        receive it, and they can begin to administer it. Then the final cession
                        could be taken up with Hungary when Hungary is in a position to act. There
                        would be no objection to that.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: None whatever, and you could by two
                        clauses, if you wanted to have those clauses incorporated in the Treaty
                        itself, provide that the Reparation Commission should investigate these acts
                        in question, Rumania agreeing to accept in advance whether, and to <pb
                            n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0466"/>what extent the property seized by
                        Rumania is in excess of the property or the share that would come to Rumania
                        under the Treaty as originally drafted. That could be done.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: And then by a protocol with those
                        different countries the question of the occupation of those territories,
                        under international law, could be taken care of; in other words, a protocol
                        with Rumania and Serbia.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: It could all be taken care of in that
                        way by a series of protocols in which these powers, in consideration of
                        receiving this territory at the present time, would accept such propositions
                        as the Council proposes.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: And that might take care of it, except
                        that we would have to do the negotiating and signing of the treaty.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: That could be done.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: For instance, assuming we can get the
                        Bulgarian Treaty negotiated and signed within a reasonable time, say within
                        the month of October, and there is no government in Hungary in sight at that
                        time, and assuming that we have composed our difficulties with Rumania,
                        which I think it is fair to assume,—why then it would be much better to
                        dispose of the Hungarian Treaty in that way, don’t you think so?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: It would be the best way, I think.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Because you see the other side of the
                        picture is this. At least what we have to consider in connection with this
                        is this, that the Turkish Treaty undoubtedly will not be negotiated for a
                        long time. Now it is manifestly ridiculous to keep people waiting on a
                        country to be formed, like Hungary, when we can accomplish all we need
                        accomplish just now by protocol.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: You can accomplish all that you have in
                        mind, as you have expressed it here, by a series of protocols, either
                        collectively or individually, and in addition to that, you can have the
                        Hungarian Treaty prepared and ready for signature when a government has been
                        formed and when plenipotentiaries have been appointed by that government in
                        order to sign, because it is not a negotiated treaty—it is really an imposed
                        treaty. Otherwise, of course, you would have to wait on the formation of the
                        government for negotiation. But the treaty can be drawn and left in such a
                        shape that it can be handed over to the representatives of the government
                        when the government is formed and when those representatives are here to
                        receive it, and in the meantime all these relations between the Allied and
                        Associated Powers outside of and beyond Hungary, can be arranged either by a
                        general protocol, or by separate protocols with each of the nations
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: A protocol could take care of, for
                        instance, the subject of reparations.</p>
                    <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0467"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Absolutely.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Which we would refer to the Committee to
                        study to see what steps are necessary to be taken in order to protect Serbia
                        and Poland and other claimants. That could be taken care of by a
                        protocol.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Everything could be taken care of by
                        protocol.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I think that would be the first step: to
                        refer it to the Reparations Committee to see what they would recommend.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: That would include, of course, the
                        financial clauses.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: The financial clauses would be included
                        in that. Then complete the Hungarian Treaty directly, and then if within
                        three or four weeks the Hungarians are not ready to act, we can get
                        authority to sign a protocol taking care of the territorial questions, and
                        at the same time binding all parties on the question of reparations.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: And we would get that much of the Treaty
                        taken care of.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: As a matter of fact that would take care
                        of the situation excepting the ultimate contribution which Hungary has to
                        make as to reparation.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: The difficulty is that you would
                        negotiate with Rumania and Serbia and the other powers, whereas you do not
                        negotiate with Hungary, so that if these negotiations were begun toward that
                        end at once agreements might be reached and reduced to the form of protocol
                        for signature, leaving, just as you say, the Hungarian Treaty to be handed
                        to the Hungarians when there is a government to receive it, and in that way,
                        by separate instruments, you cover the entire field—and we can get home.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Mr. Dresel, you were going to bring that
                        up, were you not?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Dresel</hi>: Yes. You understand that when they are
                        speaking of the Reparations Commission, there are two so-called committees
                        that there may be some confusion about. There is the committee on
                        organization—the Reparation Commission. That is a body which meets every
                        week and discusses current business and the future organization of the
                        Reparation Commission. Outside that there is a commission which the French
                        call the Reparation Commission, which was formed merely to discuss the
                        Treaty clauses.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: The Commission on Treaty clauses was the
                        one I had in mind; that is the one we are actually represented on. The other
                        one we merely sit in on.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Dresel</hi>: Exactly.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Was there anything you wished to bring
                        up?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Dresel</hi>: Just this: I have been considering with
                        Mr. Woolsey the rather important question of how far the Reparation
                        Commission <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0468"/>and other important
                        committees are going to be authorized to function as soon as three of the
                        Allied and Associated Powers ratify the Treaty, and that has been brought to
                        my attention by the French in the first place, and now by the British, who
                        have handed in a memorandum on the subject. Mr. Woolsey prepared a
                        memorandum, which I think you saw, to the effect that in his opinion these
                        committees are authorized by the Treaty to enter upon their functions as
                        soon as three powers ratify, apart from whether we ratify or not.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: He is of that opinion?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Dresel</hi>: He is of that opinion, and I am
                        inclined to agree with him. There was quite a bit of doubt at first, and
                        there was a difference of opinion, but after looking over all the Treaty
                        clauses and the Reparation clauses, I am quite sure of that myself. The
                        question is coming up tomorrow in the Reparation Committee, and I am also
                        drafting a telegram to the Department expressing my views, but I think it is
                        our attitude, and I hope it is one that the Commission would take, that they
                        can function as soon as three ratify. So much hangs and depends on this
                        Reparation Commission at the present time, that I think if all the machinery
                        is blocked it may lead to the most serious consequences.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Surely.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Mr. Polk, might I say as a part of the
                        remark that has just been made by Mr. Dresel, that making the Treaty go into
                        effect upon the ratification by three powers was a measure devised by the
                        American Commission for the express purpose of putting it into effect should
                        there be a refusal on the part of Italy or Japan to agree to it, and it is
                        the distinct understanding of all concerned that the Treaty would go into
                        effect legally just as soon as three of the Principal Powers—whatever ones
                        they might be—should deposit their ratifications, and it was for that
                        purpose and none other.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: It seems obvious that the whole machinery
                        should not be held up.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: Of course that remark is of a
                        confidential nature, but that was the reason for it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: We have provided a remedy for the ills
                        created by ourselves.</p>
                    <p>Have you anything, Colonel? (Addressing Col. Browning)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colonel Browning</hi>: No, sir.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Mr. Nielsen?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Mr. Buckler?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Buckler</hi>: I would like to ask if there is any
                        objection to the British Commission having (to keep in their secret files as
                        a secret document) a copy of the Crane-King report. They saw it and their
                        interest in it was excited.</p>
                    <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0469"/>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: I think they had better trust to their
                        memories. There will probably be a fight on that. They read it, and I don’t
                        doubt that they made very copious notes of it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Buckler</hi>: No doubt they did. But they want a
                        complete copy. They undoubtedly could have made extensive notes of it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Yes, but they just tried, perhaps, to
                        economize on stenographers.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nielsen</hi>: Before coming here today I started to
                        dictate a page and one-half of telegram to the Secretary of State on the
                        main points that have been raised in this Belgian-Holland affair. I suppose
                        we ought to keep them posted as to what is going on.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Yes. Has anyone else anything to bring
                        out?</p>
                    <p>If anyone is on a committee, and the committee report is unanimous, and the
                        matter is to be brought before the Supreme Council, I wish you would please
                        notify me the day before so I will have an opportunity of reading the
                        report. I was able yesterday to change the procedure, and hereafter there
                        will be no report read or made to the Council where there has been a
                        unanimous report below. Each delegate is supposed to inform himself on the
                        matter, and if he has any objection to raise he must raise it; where there
                        is objection he must say that he wishes the matter heard. We are not going
                        to waste our time in having a report read and then everybody agreeing,
                        having been properly instructed from their rear that they should agree.
                        There has been a frightful waste of time because of these things. We have a
                        long calendar, and we have not been able to get along as fast as we should.
                        The unfortunate Colonel Goodyear sat out there for five days; his matter is
                        on the calendar each day, but it is not reached. How they make up the
                        calendar I have not been able to discover. None of the important things are
                        ever put on. The things that the French Foreign Office does not want on it,
                        do not appear on it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Buckler</hi>: I was told by Colonel Castoldi, the

                        nothing more will be heard about that Koritza thing. It is dropped off the

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: It is dropped off because I made such an

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: No,—unanimous. The point being this: the
                        other day there was up the question of Galicia. We listened a whole morning
                        to dear old Mr. Cambon … about matters that there had been no disagreement
                        whatever on, but he reported in detail, and when he got through each one of
                        our experts said there was no disagreement. We were all agreed. We wasted an
                        hour and a half on that. There were three points on which we did not agree.
                        We should all have been <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0470"/>notified
                        the day before that this was put on. There was absolute agreement except on

                        in the Polish Diet. We moved that the thing be adopted in full, excepting
                        the three subjects I mentioned, and then discussed them. We wil be here the

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: We considered two of them, and we found
                        grounds to compromise on the agrarian laws and on the subject of
                        representation in the Polish Diet.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: But the military you did not?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: Not the military. I proposed a solution
                        on which the British were holding out; the British were willing to accept,
                        but before we got to that Mr. Paderewski came in, asking for a hearing, and
                        he played on the Council as he played on the famous piano, and we all almost
                        wept—and we are all on the point of reversing ourselves on it. I think he
                        exaggerated his position, but I think he is quite right in doing so—he said
                        that they would rather not have Galicia, tied up the way we have it tied up.
                        I think he is right; they could not administer it; I think it would just
                        make trouble. I am not sure but that he is not right. I think we are
                        disposed to send it back to the Committee and see if they can work up some
                        scheme. That report legislates on every blooming thing; they don’t leave
                        anything to the imagination at all, and it is such an iron-clad arrangement
                        that we are giving Poland to administer, that I think there is a great deal
                        in what Mr. Paderewski said.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Scott</hi>: That is nothing that our Drafting
                        Committee had to do with?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Polk</hi>: No.</p>
                    <p>The meeting adjourned at 3:10 p.m.</p>

                    <p>I. General Bliss read a communication which he had received from the Military
                        Attaché at the Hague giving certain information <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435"
                            facs="0471"/>obtained from a source not stated to the effect that
                        Germany was preparing to attack France in October, when a revolution was
                        expected to break out, and giving further detailed information regarding the
                        plot and the preparatory steps which had been and were now being taken by

                    <p>The Commissioners approved the suggestion that General Bliss should forward a

                    <p>The Commissioners were not in a position to make reply to the inquiries
                        contained in the Department’s telegram under reference and were of the
                        opinion that inasmuch as the matter did not directly concern the Peace
                        Conference it was a matter for the attention of the Embassy.</p>
                    <p>III. The Commissioners approved a further allotment to General Bandholtz<note

                        Commissioners approved in principle the discontinuance of the Press Bureau
                        of the Commission and authorized the Secretary General to wind up the Bureau
                        unless he should be satisfied that there were adequate reasons for its
                        continuance. Should the Bureau be closed, the Commissioners <pb n="436"
                            xml:id="pg_436" facs="0472"/>desired that a telegram be sent to the
                        Department of State requesting that the daily news telegram “For Grew from
                        Emery” be enlarged. <seg type="margin">Discontinuance of Press
                        Bureau</seg></p>
                    <p>In this connection the Commissioners approved the recommendation contained in
                        Memorandum 573 dated September 26th regarding the release of Mr. Beryl and
                        the payment of his salary up to October 1st. It was understood that upon the
                        departure of Mr. Beryl the morning summaries of the French Press would be
                        prepared by Captain Gordon of Mr. Grew’s office.</p>
                    <p>VII. The Secretary read an unnumbered dispatch dated September 13th from the
                        American Chargé d’Affaires at Sofia to the Commission regarding the
                        systematic violation of the armistice conditions with Bulgaria. (Memorandum

                        departure of General Chrétien for Paris and also the attitude of his
                        colleagues and of the chiefs of the British, French and Italian military
                        missions in Sofia with regard to the policy heretofore pursued by the

                    <p>I. The Commissioners discussed the most recent information received from
                        Admiral Andrews regarding the situation in the Adriatic. Mr. Polk mentioned
                        the instructions under which the United States Naval Forces were operating
                        and it was agreed that he would send a telegram to inquire whether the
                        President desired any change in these standing instructions. <seg
                            type="margin">The Situation in the Adriatic</seg></p>
                    <p>II. Mr. Polk stated that he had received a telegram from Mr. Phillips giving
                        the answers made by the French and French and Italian ambassadors in
                        Washington to the representation which had been made to them by Mr. Phillips
                        regarding the obstructive pro-Rumanian attitude of the French and Italian
                        ministers in Bucarest. In Mr. Polk’s opinion both replies really meant
                        nothing at all. <seg type="margin">Attitude of French and Italian Diplomatic

                    <p>III. Mr. Polk stated that he had looked into the matter of turning over of
                        the Hotel to the management and was inclined to think that in view of the
                        fact that the Hotel had been requisitioned it would be unnecessary to give
                        the usual month’s notice. He had been told that the British had not given
                        the month’s notice in giving up the Majestic. For this reason, and also on
                        account of the difficulties of properly carrying on the work of the
                        Commission, should it be necessary for the Commissioners to stay over beyond
                        the first of November, he thought it would be desirable to cancel the orders
                        already issued that notice should be given to the management on October
                        first that the Hotel would be given up on the first of November. <seg

                    <p>Lt. Commander John W. Reeves, Jr., U. S. N. entered the meeting.</p>
                    <p>IV. The Commissioners heard Lt. Commander Reeves, Jr. on the situation in the
                        Adriatic.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Reeves stated that he had been with the <hi rend="italic">Pittsburg</hi>
                        since July 12, that he had left Fiume on the 25th, proceeding via Venice and
                        Switzerland, direct to Paris. <seg type="margin">Hearing of Lt. Comdr.
                            Reeves</seg></p>
                    <p>Speaking of the incident at Trau, Mr. Reeves stated that the <hi
                            rend="italic">Olympia</hi> and a destroyer had proceeded to Trau and
                        that 100 men from the <hi rend="italic">Olympia</hi> and 25 from the
                        destroyer had been landed; that the Italians had no idea of resisting, that
                        they had offered to surrender but this had not been accepted, and that they
                        had been ordered out of the American zone. After they had left the town,
                        three Italians had been found and had been turned over to the Italian
                        warship at Spalato. The American landing force had successfully patrolled
                        the town and had placed the Italians in one house so that there would be no
                        possibility of any untoward incident. As the Americans left, the Serbs had
                        come in. There were now more Serb troops in Trau than there had been
                        previously.</p>
                    <p>When word reached Spalato of the arrival of the Italians in Trau, Capt. Boyd
                        had sent his liaison officer to the Serbs and had secured their consent to
                        withhold action to two hours. This enabled the Americans to settle the
                        matter without a conflict between the Serbs and the Italians. Capt. Boyd had
                        arranged for the same arrangement to be in force should any further
                        encroachments be made by the Italians.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Reeves stated that the Serbs generally say that war exists. Local feeling
                        is very bitter. But, so far there have been no disorders at Spalato which is
                        effectively policed by the Serbs.</p>
                    <p>As regards Fiume, Mr. Reeves stated that the Italians had treated the Serbs
                        badly from the beginning. The population of the town of Fiume consisted of
                        75% Serbs and 25% Italians. The so-called suburb of Sussac was entirely
                        Serb. When the Italians arrived in <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0474"
                        />Fiume they prevented an election and put in the National Council. They
                        also brought in a number of cut-throats under Major Abba. These men were
                        practically kept under lock and key and only turned loose when the Italians
                        wished to create disorder. The Italian troops took control of the issuance
                        of passports, favored their own people and oppressed the Serbs. They also
                        either compelled people to leave or forcibly deported them. Some of the
                        former were to be found in Gravosa and Ragusa, and of the latter, some were
                        in Italy and others in the Islands off Spalato.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Reeves described d’Annunzio’s entry into the town. On hearing of his
                        approach, General Gondolfo, commanding the Italian forces, had proceeded in
                        his automobile to meet d’Annunzio and had made a speech imploring him not to
                        enter. D’Annunzio had answered from his automobile, saying that he had to
                        come in. Gondolfo replied he could not forcibly keep him out as this would
                        lead to fratricide. D’Annunzio then entered.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Reeves estimated that d’Annunzio had between five and eight thousand men
                        in Fiume at the time of his departure. The so-called “Queen’s Brigade”,
                        which was occupying Sussac, was really loyal to d’Annunzio. D’Annunzio
                        seemed to have no difficulty in feeding his troops. The blockade was a
                        farce. Sixty carloads of food and supplies had been allowed to enter Fiume
                        for d’Annunzio’s forces.</p>
                    <p>In reply to a question as to the attitude of the Commander-in-Chief of the
                        Italian forces surrounding Fiume, Mr. Reeves stated that General di Robilant
                        who had been in command had made it known that he would use any means
                        necessary to suppress d’Annunzio. The next day he was relieved. He was
                        succeeded by General Badoglio, Chief of Staff of the Italian Army. Badoglio
                        had announced that he proposed to starve out the rebels but had not
                        committed himself about using force. Badoglio was now in Trieste. At the
                        present time there were from fifty to seventy-five thousand Italian troops
                        in the neighborhood of Fiume. All of these were prepared to go over to
                        d’Annunzio. The Serbs had about fifteen thousand regular troops along the
                        frontier line, and some volunteer forces. Mr. Reeves commented upon the lack
                        of discipline in the Italian troops and especially certain statements in
                        this regard which had been made to him by the Captain of the <hi
                            rend="italic">Dante Alighieri</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Referring to the American forces in the Adriatic, Mr. Reeves suggested the
                        advisability of making an announcement to the effect that additional
                        American and Allied forces would be sent to the Adriatic. It would be
                        necessary to send battleships from home but he believed that if a strong
                        force appeared their mere presence would ensure order. In answer to a
                        question as to whether Admiral Andrews would land marines in Spalato, Mr.
                        Reeves stated that the Admiral would not do so under his new orders.</p>
                    <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0475"/>
                    <p>In conclusion, Mr. Reeves stated that he planned to leave Paris for Italy on
                        Wednesday evening, and would be glad to have any instructions or information
                        which the Commissioners cared to give him for Admiral Andrews.</p>

                    <p>I. The Commissioners discussed with Admiral McCully the latest news regarding
                        the Adriatic. Mr. Polk stated that after the meeting of the Council that
                        morning, Mr. Clemenceau had said that he was withdrawing the French troops
                        from Fiume and that he was leaving the French base and the supplies there,
                        valued at some 16,000,000 francs in the charge of the Italians. Mr. Polk
                        also said that he had spoken with Sir Eyre Crowe with regard to the
                        intentions of the British Government and had discovered that Sir Eyre Crowe
                        was not informed in the matter. Sir Eyre Crowe, however, promised to take up
                        the matter with London and ascertain whether the British Government intended
                        to send any naval units. <seg type="margin">Situation in the
                        Adriatic</seg></p>
                    <p>Mr. Polk asked Admiral McCully to see the French naval authorities with a
                        view to ascertain[ing] what steps, if any, they proposed to take. He also
                        asked that Admiral McCully telegraph Admiral Knapp suggesting that the
                        latter should endeavor to discover the intention of the British
                        Admiralty.</p>
                    <p>II. The Commissioners approved the release of Captain Walter Peirce, head of
                        the translation bureau, as stated in Memorandum 575. <seg type="margin"
                            >Release of Capt. Peirce</seg></p>
                    <p>III. The Commissioners asked Mr. McNeir to attend the meeting and informed
                        him that they had reconsidered their decision that notice should be given to
                        the management on the first of October that the Commission would give up the
                        Hotel on the first of November. <seg type="margin">Delivery of the Hotel
                            Crillon</seg></p>
                    <p>Mr. McNeir stated that it would be possible to give up the Hotel without
                        necessarily giving the management a month’s notice as he felt that they
                        would be only too glad to get the Hotel at any time.</p>
                    <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0476"/>
                    <p>There was, however, the question of the French help. The law required that
                        they should receive thirty days’ notice. It would therefore be necessary to
                        give them this notice or pay them a month’s salary, if they should be
                        suddenly discharged. It was agreed that Mr. McNeir should inform the help
                        that it was probable that the Commission would give up the Hotel on the
                        first of November. Mr. McNeir believed that there would be no difficulty in
                        keeping on the help as long as was desired as they would receive a month’s
                        pension from the Hotel’s management in any case.</p>
                    <p>As regards giving up certain sections of one or more floors of the Hotel, Mr.
                        McNeir stated that the management would be glad if this could be done. They
                        hoped to have the hotel ready for regular clients by the first of the year
                        and they desired, if possible, to have sixty days to put the hotel in
                        shape.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners approved Mr. McNeir’s suggestion that as soon as possible a
                        floor of the hotel might be closed up for repairs. He suggested that a start
                        be made with the fifth floor. In order that this should be done, the
                        Commissioners approved Mr. McNeir’s recommendation that from now on he
                        should refuse all applications for permission to reside in the hotel, and
                        likewise restrict the sale of dining room tickets.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners decided, however, that rooms should be found in the hotel
                        for those regularly attached to the Peace Commission, the members of the
                        field missions and departmental officials. Any applications from members of
                        the Army for permission to reside in the hotel should be referred by Mr.
                        McNeir to General Bliss.</p>

                    <p>I. Mr. Polk stated that Mr. Misu, the Roumanian delegate, had called upon him
                        with Colonel Antonesco. As an instance of the attitude of the French Foreign
                        Office, Mr. Polk pointed out that although Antonesco had been sent to Paris
                        by the Roumanian Government in order to explain their point of view to the
                        conference and had seen M. Pichon and various members of the French Foreign
                        Office, <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0477"/>nothing had been said of
                        his visit and no effort at all had been made by the Secretariat General to
                        have him heard by the Council. <seg type="margin">Call by Roumanian
                            Representatives on Mr. Polk</seg></p>
                    <p>Colonel Antonesco’s attitude at the conference with Mr. Polk had been at the
                        beginning rather stand-off-ish and he had been much on his dignity but
                        towards the end his attitude had improved. It appeared from Antonesco’s
                        remarks that the Roumanians had taken their cue with regard to their policy
                        of seizures from the French, who on entering Hungary had seized large
                        quantities of rolling stock and other supplies. Mr. Polk assured Colonel
                        Antonesco that he was always anxious to hear anything the Roumanians had to
                        say but at the present moment it was incumbent upon them to supply the arms
                        necessary for the <hi rend="italic">gendarmerie</hi>. He observed that they
                        had procrastinated even after promising to furnish the arms. He insisted
                        that the Roumanians comply with the instructions given them in this regard
                        by the Allied generals. Antonesco had tried to evade the issue and had made
                        excuses of various kinds and had also referred to the Allied grab of the
                        Mackensen supplies, which has greatly incensed the Roumanians. Finally, Mr.
                        Polk informed Antonesco that if and when the Roumanians would arm the police
                        force, he would be prepared to discuss other questions.</p>
                    <p>The most interesting point developed by the conversation was the fact that
                        the Roumanians were in a serious situation, as they had no ammunition. It
                        appeared that the embargo placed by the Supreme Council on the shipment of
                        ammunition and supplies was the real factor in the matter. Mr. Polk had no
                        doubt that the Roumanians would be good as long as the embargo were
                        enforced.</p>
                    <p>II. The Commissioners inquired what if any action had been taken on General
                        Bandholtz’s telegram No. 59, and expressed an opinion favorable to granting
                        the request made by General Bandholtz in this telegram. <seg type="margin"
                            >Assignment for General Bandholtz</seg></p>
                    <p>III. The Commissioners approved a recommendation contained in Memorandum No.
                        576 regarding a request from General Bandholtz that Colonel William E. H.
                        Godson, Jr., Military Attaché at Berne, should be assigned for temporary
                        duty to his Mission. <seg type="margin">Assignment of Colonel Godson to
                            General Bandholtz</seg></p>
                    <p>IV. The Commissioners directed that the Secretary General prepare for their
                        approval a suitable reply to the identic letters dated September 17, 1919,
                        addressed to them by the Honorable Edward Voigt with regard to the
                        repatriation of German prisoners of war in Siberia. It was suggested that
                        the Secretary General transmit to Mr. Voigt a copy of the recent decision of
                        the Supreme Council in this regard. <seg type="margin">Letter From the

                    <p>V. General Bliss read a copy of a letter dated September 24, 1919, which he
                        had received from Major General Henry T. Allen, U. S. A., <pb n="442"

                        sentenced to confinement in the United States for grave offenses committed

                    <p>I. The Commissioners approved the release of Mr. Lester H. Woolsey,
                        Lieutenant R. E. Condon and Mr. H. G. Crocker as stated in Memorandum 577.

                        held in abeyance for the time being.</p>
                    <p>III. Memorandum 579 with regard to the report on Montenegro submitted by the
                        Count de Salis was read and noted by the Commissioners. <seg type="margin"

                    <p>IV. A memorandum dated October 1st, addressed by Mr. McNeir to the
                        Commissioners through the Secretary General, was read.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners approved the recommendation that eleven out of the
                        forty-seven cars now in the service of the Mission be turned over to the
                        Motor Transport Corps immediately. <seg type="margin">Commission

                    <p>The Commissioners desired that the question of possible further reduction in
                        the number of Commission cars should be brought up for consideration some
                        time after the sixth instant.</p>
                    <p>In this relation the Commissioners gave direction that no cars should be used
                        for trips to the front or the devastated regions without their explicit
                        permission.</p>

                    <p>V. Mr. Polk referred to the request which had been presented to him by
                        Commander McLean for permission to return to the United States. The
                        Commander had stated that his work could be taken over by the Army officer
                        of whom he had spoken to Mr. Polk. <seg type="margin">Release of Commander

                    <p>I. The Commissioners discussed and approved a telegram to be sent by General
                        Bliss to the Secretary of War with regard to the question referred by the
                        Supreme Council to the Military Advisors at Versailles, relative to the
                        furnishing of military supplies, ammunition and rolling stock by the United
                        States, France, Great Britain and Italy to Poland. <seg type="margin"
                            >Supplies for Poland</seg></p>
                    <p>II. Mr. Polk stated that he was more than satisfied that both the British and
                        the French were doing everything possible to secure German trade. The main
                        points of entry into Germany through the occupied territory were at Cologne
                        and Mayence; also to a very much smaller extent, at Coblenz. In Mr. Polk’s
                        opinion it was highly desirable that the United States should have a
                        Consular Officer at Coblenz who should be assigned there as commercial
                        advisor. He knew that such an appointment would be very acceptable to Major
                        General Allen, commanding the American forces of occupation on the Rhine.
                        Mr. Polk also thought it desirable that the United States should have an
                        official in a smaller capacity at Cologne, and suggested the name of Mr.
                        Coffin. Mr. Polk stated that he would telegraph to the State Department in
                        this regard. <seg type="margin">Facilities for American Businessmen To Enter
                            Germany</seg></p>
                    <p>Mr. Polk stated further that he had spoken to General Allen with regard to
                        the difficulties encountered by Americans proceeding to Germany through
                        Cologne. General Allen had assured him that he would do everything possible
                        to facilitate the entry of such Americans via Coblenz. In this connection
                        Mr. Polk pointed out that our businessmen were at a considerable
                        disadvantage as compared with the <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0480"
                        />British and French in view of the fact that Coblenz was not one of the
                        main arteries into Germany.</p>
                    <p>III. Mr. White stated that he had learned from a reliable source that the
                        British had completed contracts with Germany to supply the latter with oil.
                        Mr. Polk questioned the truth of this report in view of the recent decision
                        of the Supreme Council that the German oil tankers now at Hamburg should be
                        used for their first voyage, and if necessary for a second voyage, to carry
                        oil from the United States to Germany. <seg type="margin">British Oil for
                            Germany</seg></p>
                    <p>IV. Mr. White stated that he had been informed by Mr. Bonsal, who had just
                        returned from Germany, that in a conversation with Count Bernstorff,<note
                            n="41" xml:id="d160fn41">German Ambassador to the United States,
                            1908–1917.</note> which took place in the Adlon Hotel in Berlin,
                        Bernstorff had asked Bonsai to try and persuade the Conference not to send
                        any more offensive notes. Bernstorff had claimed that the last note with
                        regard to the withdrawal of the German forces in the Baltic Provinces had
                        cost the German Government 200,000 votes. <seg type="margin">Effect of
                            Recent Ultimatums of the Conference in Germany</seg></p>
                    <p>V. Memorandum 580, on the subject of the release of Mr. Huguenin on duty with
                        the Commission, and a memorandum submitted by him dated October 7 in this
                        regard, was read. The Commissioners did not feel prepared to refuse Mr.
                        Huguenin’s request in this regard should he thereby run the risk of losing
                        his permanent position in New York City as Professor of French. On the other
                        hand, the Commissioners did not consider it wise to leave the translator’s
                        office with but one translator. They therefore directed that the Secretary
                        General look into the matter, and should he find it necessary to release Mr.
                        Huguenin, provision should be made to secure a suitable person to take his
                        place. <seg type="margin">Release of Mr. C. W. Huguenin</seg></p>
                    <p>VI. A memorandum from Mr. McNeir to the Commissioners reporting the return of
                        Dr. Bowman, and his assignment to the Commission by direction of the
                        Secretary of State, was read and noted by the Commissioners. <seg
                            type="margin">Return of Dr. Bowman</seg></p>
                    <p>VII. Memorandum 581 with regard to Bulgarian opposition to the cession of
                        Tzaribrod to Serbia was read and noted by the Commissioners. <seg
                            type="margin">Bulgarian Protest to the Cession of Tzaribrod</seg></p>
                    <p>VIII. The Commissioners approved the request presented by Colonel Logan and
                        submitted in Memorandum 582 with regard to the assignment of rooms in the
                        Crillon and the granting of dining-room privileges to Mr. White and Miss
                        Stacey, assistants to Colonel Logan. <seg type="margin">Assignment [<hi

                    <p>It was understood that the salaries of Mr. White and Miss Stacey would be
                        defrayed by Colonel Logan as heretofore.</p>
                    <p>IX. Mr. White called attention to a communication addressed by the
                        Bessarabian delegates, Kroupensky and Ch. Schmidt, to the <pb n="445"
                            xml:id="pg_445" facs="0481"/>President of the Peace Conference under
                        date of September 26, 1919, with regard to certain actions of the Roumanian
                        Government in Bessarabia, in particular to the compulsory participation in
                        the parliamentary elections of Roumania which will shortly be held. Mr.
                        White proposed that this matter should be brought up in the Supreme Council;
                        a suggestion in which the Commissioners concurred. <seg type="margin"
                            >Elections of Bessarabia</seg></p>
                    <p>X. The permission of the Commissioners was requested for the assignment of an
                        automobile to Messieurs Welsh and Harris and perhaps two others from the
                        Commission, for a trip to Germany, as set forth in Memorandum No. 583. <seg
                            type="margin">Request of Messieurs Welsh and Harris for Trip to
                            Germany</seg></p>
                    <p>The Commissioners were unable to grant the permission requested but
                        authorized the assignment of a car to Messrs. Welsh and Harris for a
                        two-days’ trip to the front on the understanding that at least three other
                        members of the Commission would accompany them.</p>
                    <p>In this connection the Commissioners directed that Peace Commission cars
                        should not be used for visits to German occupied territory, to Luxemburg, or
                        to Belgium. Peace Commission cars, however, might be used for the purpose of
                        visiting the front and places of principal interest, such as Verdun. These
                        trips should preferably take place over Sundays as heretofore and should not
                        exceed two days.</p>
                    <p>XI. The Commissioners saw no objection to granting the request submitted by
                        General Bandholtz in his telegram No. 122 of October 5, 1919, for permission
                        to visit Belgrade. It was desired, however, that the telegram in question
                        should not be answered until after Sir George Clerk had been heard by the
                        Supreme Council. <seg type="margin">Visit of General Bandholtz to

                    <p>I. Mr. Polk read a telegram which he proposed to send to the Secretary of
                        State with regard to the question of furnishing supplies, ammunition and
                        rolling stock for the Polish Army. He also <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446"
                            facs="0482"/>read a telegram which he was sending to the Secretary of
                        State relative to the question of closing up the Commission and with regard
                        to the various matters which might be turned over to the Embassy.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners discussed briefly the situation in the Baltic Provinces and
                        the nature of the reply to be made to the last German note. Mr. Polk
                        directed the Secretary to endeavor to obtain a copy of the draft to be
                        presented to the Supreme Council at the next meeting by Marshal Foch, in
                        order that he might have time to examine it before the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Polk explained the nature of the telegram which he had sent to Mr. Dodge
                        at Belgrade with regard to the settlement of the Fiume question. He had
                        informed Mr. Dodge that the President’s suggestion with regard to a buffer
                        state included a provision whereby the inhabitants of the state, should they
                        so desire, might make an appeal to the League of Nations for permission to
                        hold a plebiscite. Mr. Dodge could therefore state to the Serbian Government
                        that the ultimate disposition of the territory was left to the League of
                        Nations. Mr. Dodge had also been instructed to volunteer the information to
                        the Serbian Government orally that it was not for them to place any obstacle
                        in the way of a settlement of the Fiume question, in view of the attitude of
                        the President throughout the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>II. The Commissioners took note of a report submitted by Commander McLean, U.
                        S. N., under date of October 2, with regard to the Medical Dispensary
                        attached to the Commission, and the fact that Captain Whitmore, U. S. A.,
                        who has been attached to the Commission since September 1, 1919, would be in
                        charge of the Dispensary after his departure. <seg type="margin">Departure

                    <p>III. Memorandum No. 584, with regard to a letter addressed to Mr. Clemenceau
                        by the Austrian Peace Delegation regarding the danger of Jugo-Slav
                        aggression in the Klagenfurt district in case of evacuation by the Italians
                        was read. The Commission approved the first paragraph of the recommendation
                        submitted in the memorandum under reference, to the effect that a copy of
                        the letter in question be sent to the American Legation at Belgrade with
                        instructions to bring the matter informally to the attention of the
                        Jugo-Slav Government, expressing the unfortunate impression which would be
                        created by any violation of the terms of the Treaty of Peace. <seg

                    <p>The suggestion contained in the second paragraph of the recommendation in
                        question was disapproved.</p>

                    <p>IV. The Commissioners approved the recommendation contained in Memorandum No.
                        585 to the effect that quarters and office space should not be provided in
                        the Hotel Crillon for the members of General Harbord’s Mission, but that if
                        possible they be accommodated at 45 Avenue Montaigne. <seg type="margin"

                    <p>V. The Secretary read a confidential report prepared by Mr. Leeper of the
                        British Delegation, who accompanied Sir George Clerk to Bucharest, with
                        regard to the situation in Roumania and the Roumanian policy towards
                        Hungary. <seg type="margin">The Roumanian Situation</seg></p>
                    <p>The Commissioners noted the report with interest.</p>
                    <p>VI. Mr. White called attention to and read certain extracts from a memorandum
                        dated October 6th, submitted by Mr. W. H. Buckler regarding a conversation
                        with Hain Nahum, Grand Rabbi of Turkey. The memorandum in question reads as
                        follows: <seg type="margin">Views of Hain Nahum, Grand Rabbi of Turkey</seg>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The Grand Rabbi, who has just arrived from Constantinople,
                                emphasizes the importance of dealing immediately with the Turkish
                                question and of not allowing it to be postponed for three or four
                                months, as seems to be the present intention.</p>
                            <p>1. The dangers are (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) financial collapse of
                                the Turkish Government and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) increasing
                                disorder in the interior of Asia Minor. The second of these is
                                partly dependent on the first because the present poverty of the
                                Turkish Government makes it impossible for them to keep an adequate
                                    <hi rend="italic">gendarmerie.</hi></p>
                            <p>The Government has hitherto maintained itself by selling large stocks
                                of tobacco, wool and other materials acquired during the war. This
                                source of ready money is now coming to an end, and there is
                                practically no revenue owing to the fact that trade cannot revive
                                and customs-duties depending on imports cannot be paid until peace
                                is made. The comatose condition of the port of Smyrna and the
                                impossibility of exporting the large surplus of this year’s
                                magnificent harvest are examples of the general financial
                                paralysis.</p>
                            <p>Unless something is done, the result will be that thousands of
                                government employees, police officers, army officers, etc. will go
                                unpaid, they and their families will be starving, and complete
                                disorganization with disorder is certain to follow. Constantinople
                                is full of Bolshevik agents, and, notwithstanding the lethargy of
                                the Turk, the Rabbi believes that Bolshevik propaganda will take
                                root among the thousands of starving government officials who will
                                crowd Constantinople during the coming winter.</p>
                            <p>2. The Grand Rabbi regards international control of Turkey under the
                                League of Nations for a considerable period as the only feasible
                                solution. A provisional arrangement, he thinks, could be made for
                                Armenia, subject to the transferring of that province to the United
                                States under a mandate, should the United States be willing to
                                accept it.</p>
                            <p>The cutting up of the Turkish Empire by a series of “surgical
                                operation” would have been possible at the time of the Armistice but
                                is impossible now, and no peace can be expected unless Anatolia is
                                    <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0484"/>evacuated by Greeks and
                                Italians. The movement under Mustafa Kemal is not aimed at Greek[s]
                                or Armenians within the Ottoman Empire, on the contrary it appeals
                                for their support. But it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> aimed at
                                stopping amputations from the Empire. It has an army of 40,000 good
                                fighters capable of being largely increased, and it knows that the
                                Allies will not send British, French or Italian soldiers to
                                reconquer Turkey.</p>
                            <p>3. As to Smyrna, the Grand Rabbi (who expects to visit and to warn
                                Venizelos) regards permanent Greek occupation as impossible but
                                believes that local autonomy for Smyrna and its district, under a
                                Greek governor but within the limits of the Empire, would work well
                                and would be accepted by the Turks.</p>
                            <p>A prompt solution of the Smyrna question is urgently needed because
                                the blocking of Turkey’s chief seaport is ruinous to the Nation’s
                                finances, and because it stirs up revengeful bitterness even in the
                                remotest corners of Anatolia.</p>
                            <p>4. If the Allied Powers will not discuss a permanent Turkish
                                settlement until the American attitude on mandates is known, the
                                Grand Rabbi thinks that a <hi rend="italic">provisional regime</hi>
                                should be agreed upon, under which the Turks would receive advances
                                of money enabling them to pay current salaries and expenses, subject
                                to some joint foreign control.</p>
                            <p>Unless immediate steps of this kind are taken by the Supreme Council,
                                the Grand Rabbi regards increasing disorder and chaos in Turkey as
                                inevitable.”</p>

                    <p>I. The Commissioners discussed the question of the disposition of the German
                        tank ships now in Hamburg and in particular the last telegram from the
                        Department in regard thereto. Mr. Polk undertook to telegraph Mr. Lansing
                        personally expressing the Commissioners’ views in the matter.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Polk gave an account of a conversation which he had had with M. di
                        Martino of the Italian Delegation with regard to the Adriatic question. It
                        seemed that there wes now hope of reaching a settlement, although some of
                        the latest Italian demands were not deemed acceptable. It was decided that
                        Mr. White should invite M. di Martino to call upon him in order to explain
                        the Italian proposition in further detail. The Commisisioners also agreed as
                        to the attitude which Mr. White should assume with regard to certain of the
                        Italian demands.</p>

                    <p>II. Telegram No. 585 of October 3d from the American Minister at Warsaw was
                        read with regard to the appointment of a subordinate Consular officer to be

                    <p>In view of the fact that Mr. Huddle’s transfer to the Consulate General in
                        Paris had been recommended by Consul-General Totten and submitted to the
                        Department, the Commissioners did not approve the assignment of Mr. Macatee
                        to Danzig as suggested by Mr. Gibson.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners, however, approved in principle the recommendation made by

                        be sent to the Secretary of War together with a copy of the form letter of

                        immediate appointment of an American representative on the Interallied
                        Teschen Commission and suggesting that the appointment be made from Paris,
                        was read. The following names were suggested by the Secretary General of the
                        Commission for the consideration of the Commissioners: General Jadwin,
                        General McCoy, General Sladen, Colonel Bowditch and Colonel Greene. General
                        Bliss suggested the name of General Bandholtz. <seg type="margin">American

                    <p>Mr. Polk recalled the fact that the French had appointed a civilian
                        representative, M. de Manneville, and that when the matter had come up in
                        the Supreme Council it had been suggested that civilians only should be
                        appointed to the Commission. It was his understanding that the British would
                        appoint a civilian and he was therefore inclined to think it desirable that
                        the American appointee should be a civilian.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners directed that the Secretary General should make
                        recommendations in this regard as soon as possible.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Dulles suggested that No. 6 of the questions which had been discussed
                        should more properly read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The form in which contributions towards the cost of the war should
                                be made by States acquiring territory of the former Austro-Hungarian

                                should be drafted by the experts, and after drafting should be
                                submitted for approval to the Supreme Council.”</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The suggestion was likewise made and approved, that in the future the minutes
                        should be so drafted as to bring into juxtaposition questions which were
                        discussed, together with the decisions reached in each case.</p>
                    <p>The questions which were considered by the Committee were:</p>
                    <p>1. The attitude which should be assumed by members of the American Commission
                        towards the Bulgarian and Turkish Treaties. It was decided that the
                        following question should be put up to the Commissioners: <quote

                                the Commissioners is desired as to whether our experts should not
                                attend all such meetings and participate fully in the preparatory
                                work for these treaties. If decided that they shall participate in
                                such meetings, we recommend that instructions be issued to that

                        requesting that certain questions be answered in regard to the Near East. It
                        was decided that this matter should be brought to the attention of the

                                        to accomplish their work so short, that unless some
                                        preliminary work is done for them, it will be difficult to
                                        execute the intended treaty.</item>

                                    time to time, for the purpose of a general exchange of

                                <p>“It is further suggested that if such meetings are held,
                                    advantage be taken of the first of these meetings to refer to
                                    the formation of the ‘Steering Committee’ and to make clear that
                                    it deals only with matters of procedure, and not with
                                    substantive matters of policy.”</p>

                        <item>The Committee approved of this recommendation and requested that it be
                            brought to the attention of the Commissioners at the next

                        <item>The Committee considered a memorandum prepared by Dr. Lord on some
                            documents sent to Mr. Lansing regarding the rectification of the
                            Polish-Czecho-Slovak frontier to include the districts of Spiz and
                            Orawa. The Committee decided that a recommendation should be made to the
                            Commissioners to the effect that if the Teschen question is to be
                            brought up in the Council of Five in the near future, the matter of this
                            frontier rectification might be put on the agenda at the same time; if,
                            however, the question of Teschen is to be left in the hope that the
                            Poles and Czechs will come to an agreement upon it, this question of
                            rectification of the frontier should be made a separate matter to be
                            placed on the agenda of the Council of Five at an early date.</item>

                            fact that the American Delegation has opposed the annexation of

                    <p>1. Doctor Scott reported that the French Secretariat General had requested
                        the Drafting Committee to insert a clause in the Austrian Treaty prohibiting
                        the fortification of the territory granted Czecho-Slovakia south of
                        Pressburg. The Drafting Committee had received no instructions in this
                        regard from the Supreme Council and therefore hesitated to take action. Mr.
                        A. W. Dulles stated that as the territory concerned was taken from Hungary
                        and not from Austria it appeared more appropriate to provide against its
                        fortification in the treaty with Hungary rather than in the Austrian treaty.
                        The Supreme Council had as a matter of fact approved the report of the
                        Committee which provided for the cession of this territory to
                        Czecho-Slovakia under the condition that it should not be fortified.</p>
                    <p>Doctor Johnson inquired what precautions were taken to prevent clauses being
                        slipped into the Austrian Treaty without the approval of the Supreme Council
                        Doctor Scott replied that each delegate on the Drafting Committee was
                        personally responsible in any case where there was the slightest doubt, such
                        as the above instance, to inquire of his delegation before accepting it in
                        the treaty.</p>
                    <p>2. Doctor Scott reported to Doctor Johnson that all slight alterations in the
                        territorial clauses of the Austrian Treaty which he had indicated had been
                        incorporated in the final proof by the Drafting Committee with two
                        exceptions which Doctor Scott mentioned and to which no exception was
                        taken.</p>
                    <p>3. It was noted that a number of Committees had finished their reports on
                        sections of Bulgarian Treaty but that the Supreme Council had not considered
                        these reports. Mr. A. W. Dulles was instructed to prepare a report for the
                        Commissioners with a view to having these matters presented to the Supreme
                        Council at the earliest possible moment in case the Commissioners
                        approved.</p>
                    <p>4. Mr. J. F. Dulles inquired regarding point 3 of the minutes of the meeting
                        of July 7 [<hi rend="italic">17</hi>] concerning the attitude of the British
                        Delegation on the United States’ being a signatory to the Treaty with
                        Bulgaria which had been discussed in his absence. He stated that while in
                        his opinion a certain group of the British delegation took this attitude
                        there was another group which desired American participation and he cited
                        the instance of the British representative on the Reparations
                        Commission,</p>
                    <p>5. Mr. A. W. Dulles read the summary of the state of preparation of the
                        Bulgarian Treaty which was approved with certain corrections and he was
                        instructed to circulate it to the Commissioners, for distribution to the
                        other persons interested, in case the Commissioners approved.</p>
                    <p>6. It was recommended that the Commissioners request the Supreme Council to

                        <item>With regard to the summary of the stage of preparation of the
                            Bulgarian Treaty, Dr. Scott reported that section 10 in regard to Aerial
                            Navigation has been completed, approved by the Drafting Committee and
                            put in final form in the Treaty. Colonel Grant pointed out that these
                            clauses were contained in recommendation of the Military, Naval and Air
                            representatives of June 5.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The Committee discussed the question of full powers for the signing of
                            the Bulgarian Treaty and decided to invite the attention of the
                            Commissioners to the desirability of determining immediately and before
                            the arrival of the Bulgarian delegation on July 25 what countries are to
                            sign the Bulgarian Treaty, if it is to be signed by the American
                            Commissioners and if so what Commissioners are to sign it. The Committee
                            recommends that the necessary steps be taken to have the credentials of
                            the American Commissioners in due form for exchange with the Bulgarians
                            upon their arrival, if the American Commissioners are to sign.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Dr. Scott reported regarding difficulty which he had previously
                            experienced in making rapid progress with the work of the Drafting
                            Committee. He stated however that on his recommendation the Drafting
                            Committee had agreed to continue their work on the Bulgarian Treaty
                            taking as guides the treaties with Germany and Austria and also working
                            into final form clauses based upon unanimous reports of Committees,
                            pending the approval of these reports by the Supreme Council, in order
                            that if these reports were approved the Treaty clauses would be
                            completed.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Mr. J. F. Dulles called attention to a question which had arisen in
                            drawing up an authoritative interpretation of the Rhineland Convention.
                            He stated that as the Convention was official in both French and English
                            he had taken the position that an authoritative interpretation should
                            also be in these two languages. Mr. Dulles added that although this
                            position had met with some opposition by Mr. Clemenceau it had been
                            finally accepted by the Supreme Council.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>The Commitee after some discussion of the question of the Treaty
                            clauses decided to call the attention of the Commissioners to the
                            desirability of determining the language or languages to be used in the
                            treaties with the new States, in the Treaty with Bulgaria and in the <pb
                                n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0499"/>arrangements of protocols that
                            may be drafted to complete these treaties. While these treaties would
                            necessarily be drafted and signed in French and English and possibly
                            Italian the Committee felt it was desirable that the text in one
                            language should be accepted as a standard in case of divergence. In the
                            Austrian Treaty this language was French. Secretary Lansing, before
                            leaving, expressed to Dr. Scott the desirability that the French text
                            should as in the case of the Austrian Treaty, prevail in case of
                            divergence.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Dr. Scott requested that six copies of the German Edition of the
                            Treaty of Peace as ratified at Weimar on July 9, 1919, containing the
                            instrument of ratification, which were printed by the German Government,
                            be obtained.</item>

                        <item>With reference to the question raised by Mr. J. F. Dulles regarding
                            the reply of the Allies to the German note on The Rhineland Convention,
                            Dr. Scott reported that the Drafting Committee had decided not to make
                            use of the phrase “Imperial” in the Allied reply as the translation of
                            the German “Reich” but to use the phrase “of the Empire”. A first proof
                            of the Allied reply, as corrected by the Drafting Committee, would be
                            submitted to Mr. J. F. Dulles for approval.</item>

                        <item>Mr. J. F. Dulles reported that satisfactory progress was now being
                            made on the Reparation clauses for the Bulgarian Treaty. There was one
                            question which had not been settled, namely: Whether the United States
                            was to be represented on the Bulgarian Reparations Commission. Mr.
                            Dulles stated that he was drafting a telegram of inquiry from the
                            Commission to the President in regard to such representation.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Dr. Johnson reported that a number of documents had been brought to
                            his attention showing that the Yugo-Slavs had failed to carry out the
                            order of the Allies regarding the evacuation of Klagenfurt. Mr. Harrison
                            reported that this question had been put upon the agenda of the Supreme
                            Council for the meeting of the 21st.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Harrison reported that two questions which had been brought to the
                            attention of the Commissioners by the Steering Committee, namely: That
                            of full powers for the signing of the Bulgarian Treaty and as to whether
                            Colonel House would be one of the signers—had been discussed and
                            telegrams had been drafted to cover them. As regards the language to be
                            used in the treaties to be prepared with the New States and with
                            Bulgaria and Hungary, Mr. Harrison desired information why the question
                            had been raised by the Committee as he thought the precedent set by the
                            Austrian treaty, in which the French language was to be authoritative in
                            case of divergence, was to be followed in other treaties to be prepared.
                            Dr. Scott stated that the question had been raised because of the
                            objection of the British Delegate on the Drafting Committee to accepting
                            this method of procedure.</item>

                        <item>Mr. J. F. Dulles inquired exactly what action was being taken
                            regarding the preparation of the Turkish Treaty. He added that in view
                            of the probability that the Financial Liquidation of Turkish affairs
                            would require many months, he did not feel that he could in any way
                            become involved in this task. Mr. Harrison reported that when the
                            President left for America, it was understood that the preparation of
                            the Turkish Treaty would be delayed pending determination of America’s
                            attitude regarding a Mandate; that the President has subsequently
                            telegraphed that as there might be considerable delay before he could
                            give the final answer in this regard, he suggested that the Conference
                            go ahead with the preparation of the Treaty; that this reply was
                            referred to the Supreme Council which had reached the conclusion that it
                            would be impossible to proceed with the Treaty until America’s attitude
                            was known, but that in the meantime every effort would be made to
                            preserve peace in the Turkish Empire. This opinion of the Supreme
                            Council has been referred to the President, and no reply has yet been
                            received from him.</item>

                        <item>Dr. Scott reported that the Drafting Committee had almost finished the
                            Economic Clauses for the Bulgarian Treaty. Certain provisions regarding
                            the maintenance of the Capitulations led him to believe that the United
                            States had not taken a very active part in the preparation of these
                            clauses. He had therefore brought the matter to the attention of Mr.

                            final session on the report for the Bulgarian Treaty, and adopted a
                            draft similar to the previous reports of the Commission, with the same
                            reserves on behalf of the United States and on behalf of Japan. This
                            report will shortly go to the Council for consideration.</item>

                        <item>Mr. Harrison reported that Mr. White had suggested that the Supreme
                            Council consider the reports of Committees on the Military, Naval and
                            Air clauses, the Economic Clauses, and the Ports, Waterways and Railroad
                            Clauses for the Bulgarian Treaty. Mr. Balfour had replied that he
                            considered it useless to take up these matters until the question of
                            Bulgarian frontiers had been settled.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Mr. Dulles inquired whether the Drafting Committee had received a
                            draft agreement regarding the share of Austrian debt to be assumed by
                            the states receiving Territory from the old Monarchy. Dr. Scott reported
                            that this had been received and that he and his French and British
                            colleagues had considered that it was in a form which would require
                            little alteration. The Italian delegate had objected to accepting it and
                            no progress could be made. Mr. Dulles stated that the form of Italian
                            participation in Austrian financial obligations had been considered
                            again and again in committee and in every case the final assent of the
                            Italian delegate had been obtained. He could not therefore understand on
                            what ground the Italian delegate <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0502"
                            />in the Drafting Committee could raise objection. The Committee
                            suggested that Mr. Dulles discuss the matter informally in Commission
                            and ascertain the reason for the present objection of the Italians. The
                            Committee was of the opinion that if such informal discussion could not
                            clear up the difficulty it would be necessary to refer the matter to the
                            Commissioners with a view to its being discussed by the Supreme
                            Council.</item>

                        <item>Mr. Dulles stated that he had received a number of inquiries as to
                            whether President Wilson has sent any reply to the inquiry regarding the
                            blockade of Russia. He therefore desired to know whether Mr. White had
                            communicated to the Supreme Council the substance of the President’s
                                telegram.<note n="4" xml:id="d175fn4">Telegram No. 2594, July 18,

                            Mr. Harrison stated that Mr. White had not yet done this but that he
                            would bring it to his attention in order that the necessary information
                            might be given to the Allies.</item>

                            the Yugo-Slavs that the Council’s order relative to the evacuation of
                            Klagenfurt must be carried out. They were to be given a receipt for the
                            arms and ammunition which they had captured and which were to be left in
                            the possession of Allied officers.</item>
                        <label/>
                        <item>The Committee discussed the desirability of recommending to the

                            Paris from Klagenfurt. In view of the fact that the situation had
                            materially changed since the President had sent Colonel Riggs to
                            Klagenfurt to supervise the carrying out of the Armistice, the Committee
                            did not deem it necessary to recommend any action to replace Colonel

                        <item>Dr. Johnson reported that the Yugo-Slav and Rumanian Territorial
                            Committee had considered a number of proposed modifications of the
                            northern frontier of Yugo-Slavia and had rejected all of the Yugo-Slav
                            claims with one slight exception. The frontier between Yugo Slavia on
                            the one hand and Rumania and Hungary on the other could now be
                            considered settled as far as the territorial experts were concerned. It
                            only remained for the Supreme Council to consider the report of the
                            experts.</item>

                        <item>The question of the American attitude on the signing of the Bulgarian
                            Treaty was discussed at length. The committee recognized that there
                            might be some ambiguity in the wording of the President’s telegraph
                            reply that the United States would be “Bound by the Treaty”. The
                            specific statements of President to Dr. Scott, Mr. J. F. Dulles and
                            others of the Commission that America would be a signatory power and
                            would be bound by the Treaty, were however, in the judgment of the
                            Committee, sufficient to permit the American delegation to proceed on
                            the supposition that America would sign the Treaty. Dr. Scott agreed to
                            write Mr. White a statement of his conversation with the President on
                            this question during which the latter had told him very specifically
                            that the United States would be included as one of the contracting
                            parties and would sign the treaty. Mr. Harrison inquired whether the
                            President realized in making this statement that he was reversing the
                            attitude previously taken when he had instructed American
                            representatives, in dealing with Bulgarian affairs, to be present at
                            Committee meetings but not to take any active part in the preparation of
                            the Treaty. Mr. Dulles replied that the President had stated very
                            clearly to him that he realized that in deciding to sign the Treaty he
                            was altering the position he had previously taken on this point. Dr.
                            Scott added that in his conversation with the President he had pointed
                            out to him the broader questions involved in the signing of the Treaty
                            which the President had noted so that there could be no misunderstanding
                            as to his attitude in the matter at the time he left for America.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Dr. Scott stated that Mr. Beer was anxious to proceed as soon as
                            possible to the signing of the Convention regarding “Traffic in Arms”
                            which was practically completed. Dr. Scott inquired whether in Mr.
                            Harrison’s opinion this convention as well as the “Air convention”,
                            which Mr. Lansing had taken with him to the United States, might not be
                            signed with a provision regarding ratification or later adherence to the
                            Convention as far as the United States was concerned. Mr. Harrison
                            stated that as far as the Arms Traffic Convention was concerned he did
                            not see why it could not be telegraphed in full to the United States as
                            soon as completed and, if approved, full power issued the American
                            Commissioners to sign it. As regards the Air Convention Mr. Lansing had
                            doubted whether he had full powers to <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468"
                                facs="0504"/>sign the Convention and in any case did not wish it to
                            be hurried through until the American reservations have been carefully
                            considered and The Convention submitted to the interested parties in
                            America. Mr. Harrison saw no reason why it could not be signed at a
                            later date and at the same time, possibly, as the Bulgarian and
                            Hungarian Treaties.</item>

                            felt that Mr. Grew’s presence would greatly facilitate its discussions
                            and its recommendations to the Commissions regarding the work of the
                            American Delegation.</item>

                            Council. He stated that a special item was to be added, namely, the
                            situation in Hungary, regarding which Mr. Hoover had just received
                            important information which he desired to communicate to the
                            Council.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Dr. Scott showed to the Committee copies of the German official
                            editions of the peace treaty, as well as special pamphlets noting the
                            changes which had been made in the original draft presented to the
                            Germans. Dr. Scott suggested that the appropriate experts should look
                            over this German edition of the treaty and compare it with the official
                            text and also ascertain whether the translation was an accurate
                            reproduction of the English and French text. Dr. Scott felt that it
                            might be of value to point out to the Germans any errors either in text
                            or translation of this text which the government was printing. Mr.
                            Harrison stated that in his opinion by indicating corrections we might
                            in some way make ourselves responsible for the accuracy of the remainder
                            of the text, and that it would be safer to rely exclusively upon the
                            official copy in the French Foreign Office, signed and ratified, as the
                            standard in case any dispute arose as to the accuracy of any
                            text.</item>

                        <item>Dr. Scott reported that Mr. Hurst, the British member of the Drafting
                            Committee, had inquired regarding Bulgarian frontiers and had expressed
                            the hope that the Americans would not insist on their attitude. He
                            stated to Dr. Scott that he understood that Italy had abandoned its
                            support of the American position. Dr. Johnson replied that Castoldi, the
                            Italian representative on the committee studying Bulgarian claims, had
                            recently informed him that rumors that Italy had changed its attitude
                            regarding Western Thrace were incorrect.</item>

                        <item>Dr. Scott stated that he had further evidence of the impatience of the
                            British to finish the work of the Conference as rapidly as possible. He
                            added that he was informed that Mr. Balfour intended to serve notice
                            that he was leaving on the 15th of August. A further rumor had reached
                            him that the British were threatening to make a motion that the
                            Conference adjourn on the 15th to reassemble in London 15 days later, in
                            case the French did not hurry up the general action of the
                            Conference.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Dr. Scott reported that the drafting committee had received certain
                            general instructions from the former Big Four regarding the drafting of
                            the Hungarian Treaty, and that in his opinion almost one-half of the
                            treaty was ready to be put into final form. He inquired whether in the
                            opinion of the committee it would be best for action to be taken in
                            order that the drafting committee might work on the Hungarian treaty or
                            whether it would be best to finish the treaties regarding the New
                            States. The committee felt it would be preferable to take the latter
                            course of action which made no special recommendation to the
                            Commissioners necessary.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Dr. Scott inquired whether completion of the Bulgarian treaty could
                            not be hastened by arriving at a formula under which Bulgaria would
                            agree to accept such southern frontiers as the principal Allied and
                            Associated Powers might subsequently indicate. The Committee pointed out
                            that such a solution would not make it possible for any final decision
                            to be reached regarding either the provisions on Ports and Waterways or
                            the Economic clauses and that therefore it really seemed essential to
                            definitely decide Bulgaria’s southern frontiers before the treaty could
                            be put into shape for presentation.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>The Committee discussed a provision which had crept into a draft of
                            the Bulgarian treaty providing for American representation on the
                            commission which would determine the fate of Bulgarian prisoners of war.
                            It was understood that the attitude of General Bliss was that the United
                            States should not be represented on this commission.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>Just as the meeting was breaking up and when no quorum was present,
                            Mr. J. F. Dulles brought up the question of the advisability of showing
                            the draft of the Bulgarian treaty to the Jugo-Slavs, <pb n="470"
                                xml:id="pg_470" facs="0506"/>Roumanians, and Greeks before its
                            presentation to the Bulgarians. Mr. Dulles felt that the most
                            satisfactory method of doing this would be for the various committees to
                            call the representatives of these states and discuss with them the
                            portions of the Bulgarian treaty which the committee concerned had
                            drafted. It seemed best to take up this question at the next meeting of
                            the Steering Committee with a view to a definite recommendation to the
                            Commissioners.</item>

                        <item>Dr. Scott stated that he felt that the Steering Committee had largely
                            finished the work for which it had originally been formed, and suggested
                            that in the future meetings should be held on Tuesdays, Thursdays and
                            Saturdays, at the same time—2 P.M.—rather than daily. The Committee
                            unanimously accepted Dr. Scott’s suggestion with the amendment that the
                            Chairman should call special meetings at any time it might seem
                            advisable to him.</item>

                            Balkans and Turkey which had been referred to the Committee consisting
                            of Prof. Coolidge, Mr. Buckler and himself and he was able to report
                            that the majority of the questions had already been answered or, where
                            necessary, had already been referred to the President and the Department
                            of State for decision.</item>

                            Bessarabia. Dr. Johnson suggested that the two questions might be taken
                            up with Roumania at the same time with the suggestion that Roumania’s
                            aspiration in Bessarabia might be satisfied in case she would consent to
                            certain concessions in The Dobrudja.</item>

                        <item>Mr. Dulles called the attention of the meeting to a question he had
                            raised at yesterday’s meeting regarding communicating the Bulgarian
                            Treaty to the small States directly interested—Servia, Roumania and
                            Greece—previous to handing it to the Bulgarians. The <pb n="471"
                                xml:id="pg_471" facs="0507"/>Committee unanimously approved of Mr.
                            Dulles’s suggestion that it was advisable to take such action and deemed
                            that Mr. Dulles’s proposal, that the various Committees should ask the
                            representatives of these States to meet with them, was the most feasible
                            way of communicating the various parts of the Treaty. Mr. Harrison
                            suggested that it might be desirable to suggest to Mr. White the
                            advisability of bringing up the matter at the afternoon meeting of the
                            Council.</item>

                            President that the United States was not to be represented on the
                            Bulgarian Reparations Commission.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Dr. Scott reported that it was the desire of the Commissioners that
                            the United States should not be represented on the Commission dealing
                            with Bulgarian prisoner questions. The Committee agreed that in view of
                            the Commissioners’ desire it would be well for Dr. Scott to take this
                            matter up at an early meeting of the Drafting Committee and cause the
                            wording of the Treaty to be revised accordingly.</item>

                        <item>Mr. A. W. Dulles reported that Mr. Polk was expected to arrive in
                            Paris on Tuesday and inquired whether the Committee had any further
                            suggestions to make regarding preparations for his arrival. Mr. Dulles
                            added that Mr. Grew desired an expression of opinion from the Committee
                            whether any notification to the French authorities seemed neceessary in
                            addition to the letter which he had already addressed to Mr. Dutasta.
                            The Committee felt that it would be quite proper to enquire of Mr. White
                            whether he thought it best to make a short statement in the Supreme
                            Council regarding Mr. Polk’s arrival.</item>

                            up work on the Bulgarian Treaty. He suggested certain formulae which

                            necessitating a final settlement of the Southern Frontier and the
                            Frontier in Dobrudja. Dr. Johnson felt that as the matter was on the

                            for the Committee to await the result of that meeting before making any

                            States could not be immediately completed. Mr. J. F. Dulles reported
                            that the agreement with Italy regarding its share in the contribution to
                            the general Austrian debt was being delayed because of a change in
                            Italy’s attitude. He added that Colonel Peel, the British delegate on
                            the Committee concerned, had requested that he be given time to discuss
                            the matter personally with the Italian representatives in the hope of
                            securing their final consent. Mr. Dulles deemed it wise that Colonel
                            Peel be allowed a couple of days for these conversations but stated that
                            if no further progress was made before the Thursday meeting of the
                            Steering Committee he would bring the matter again to the attention of
                            the Committee.</item>

                        <item>Dr. Scott reported that the Drafting Committee had already put into
                            form approximately one-half of the Hungarian treaty. Mr. J. F. Dulles
                            suggested that the Commissioners request the Supreme Council to instruct
                            the various Committees dealing with Hungarian matters to immediately
                            take up and finish their reports for the Hungarian Treaty. Mr. Dulles
                            remarked that in case the Austrians were granted the additional delay
                            for which they had asked, this period could be profitably employed in
                            the preparation of the Hungarian Treaty.</item>

                    <p>I. Dr. Scott gave the following analysis of the present state of preparation
                        of the Hungarian Treaty: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>(1) The Preamble and the Covenant of the League of Nations are ready.
                                The frontiers of Austria are being finally drafted by the
                                geographers and are practically ready for insertion in the Treaty.

                                for Europe are ready with the exception of the Italian Clauses. The
                                Hungarian interests outside of Europe can be modeled on the same
                                clauses in the Austrian Treaty.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>With regard to the Military, Naval and Air Clauses, Colonel Grant submitted
                        the following written report.</p>
                    <list>

                            later.</item>

                    </list>
                    <p>No action has apparently been taken on the Prisoners of War Clauses, but they
                        can very closely follow the Austrian Treaty. The Clauses on Penalties can be
                        taken bodily from the Austrian Treaty.</p>
                    <p>Mr. J. F. Dulles gave the following statement regarding the Reparation
                        Clauses for the Hungarian Treaty—The first meeting was held on the 4th. In
                        principle they will closely follow the Reparation Clauses in the Austrian
                        Treaty, but it will probably be difficult to put them in final form until it
                        is known whether any modifications will be made in the Austrian Reparation
                        Clauses as result of the Austrian reply, as such changes, if made, should be
                        embodied in the Hungarian Treaty. The same applies to the Financial
                        Clauses.</p>
                    <p>The Economic Clauses were adopted by the Supreme Council on May 26th for
                        insertion in the Hungarian Treaty.<note n="5" xml:id="d180fn5">See CF–34,

                        undergo the same changes as were made for the Economic Clauses in the
                        Austrian Treaty.</p>
                    <p>As regards Ports, Waterways and Railways, the Supreme Council directed that
                        the clauses originally adopted for this section by the Supreme Council
                        should be included in the Hungarian Treaty. With the exception of Section 3,
                        Chapter 4, the Ports, Waterways and Railways Clauses are in final form.</p>
                    <p>As a result of this summary, Dr. Scott suggested that the following
                        recommendations be made to the American Commissioners: <list>

                        </list></p>
                    <p>II. Mr. A. W. Dulles stated that the Austrian counter-reply would probably be
                        received on the 6th instant. He inquired whether any definite action by the
                        Commissioners was necessary to see that the appropriate members of the
                        American Commission should be prepared to consider it. Mr. J. F. Dulles
                        stated that, he understood that the Supreme Council had adopted a resolution
                        directing that this reply be submitted for consideration to the various
                        Committees which had drawn up the original clauses.</p>
                    <p>III. Dr. Scott asked whether Mr. J. F. Dulles could take further action to
                        hasten the completion of the agreement with Italy regarding the share of the
                        Austrian debt. Mr. Dulles replied that the Italians had submitted a new
                        proposal to which Colonel Peel and he had replied. Mr. Dulles added that the
                        matter would be actively pressed in the hope of an early solution.</p>
                    <p>IV. Dr. Scott suggested that the American Commissioners consider the
                        advisability of asking the Supreme Council to refer to the Drafting
                        Committee the Arms Traffic and the Liquor Conventions, as well as the
                        Revision of the Berlin and Brussels act.</p>
                    <p>The meeting adjourned at 2:45.</p>

                            Commissioners that an appointment should be made to carry on what might
                            remain of this work.</item>

                        <item>Colonel Grant reported that it was the opinion of a number of military
                            authorities that injustice was being done Austria in forcing her to
                            maintain only a volunteer army. Colonel Grant added that notwithstanding
                            this opinion the military representatives had been obliged to follow the
                            precedent set in the German Treaty in this regard. He felt, however that
                            this was a matter which might well be brought to the attention of the
                            Commissioners in order that when the Austrian reply was submitted to the
                            Supreme Council, the question of a change in the military terms might be
                            considered. Colonel Grant agreed to furnish a memorandum for the
                            information of the Commissioners in regard to this matter.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>Colonel Grant stated that it appeared to him to be vital to the peace
                            of Central Europe that the military forces of not only the enemy powers
                            but also of the new states should eventually be limited. The Committee
                            shared Colonel Grant’s view of this question and unanimously accepted
                            the following statement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It appears to this Committee that, if it is intended to obtain

                                    definite extent, a provision to this effect should be included

                    </list>
                    <p>1. Dr. Scott requested the views of the Committee in regard to the powers
                        which should be included as contracting parties in the agreements to be made
                        with Italy and other states obtaining territory from the former
                        Austro-Hungarian monarchy, specifying the share of these states in the cost
                        of the war of liberation. It was the opinion of the Committee that only the
                        principal Allied and Associated Powers should be contracting parties with
                        the contributing states above mentioned, rather than all the Powers that
                        figure in the Treaties of Peace with Germany and Austria.</p>
                    <p>The Committee desired that this expression of their opinion be brought to the
                        attention of the Commissioners, in order that a ruling might be obtained on
                        the question for the guidance of the American delegate on the Drafting
                        Committee.</p>
                    <p>2. Dr. Scott stated that a difference of opinion had arisen in the Drafting
                        Committee regarding the Powers which should be included as contracting
                        parties in the “Arms Convention,” “Liquor Convention,” and the “Revision of
                        the Berlin-Brussels Acts.” The British delegate on the Drafting Committee
                        desired only the states having colonies in Africa, together with the United
                        States, to be parties. Mr. Beer, the American delegate, had felt quite
                        strongly that all the Allied and Associated Powers should be parties to and
                        bound by these conventions and that neutrals should have the right of
                        adhering.</p>
                    <p>The Committee was of the opinion that Mr. Beer’s position in this matter was
                        entirely correct and should receive the support of the American delegation.
                        It was decided to bring this matter to the attention of the Commissioners,
                        in order that a ruling might be obtained for the guidance of the American
                        delegate on the Drafting Committee.</p>
                    <p>3. Dr. Scott submitted revised clauses on nationality for the Austrian Treaty
                        and requested Mr. A. W. Dulles to examine them in the light of criticism
                        which had been submitted of the former clauses of the Austrian Treaty.</p>
                    <p>4. The Committee remarked on the fact that the German Government had issued a
                        publication giving publicity to certain events and <pb n="477"
                            xml:id="pg_477" facs="0513"/>confidential discussions which had led up
                        to the conclusion of the Armistice.<note n="6" xml:id="d182fn6">The
                            publication referred to is probably Germany, Reichskanzlei, <hi
                                rend="italic">Vorgeschichte des Waffenstillstandes; amtliche

                            1924).</note> The Committee requested the Secretary to obtain copies of
                        this publication and to see that a copy was sent as soon as possible to
                        Washington.</p>
                    <p>Mr. A. W. Dulles reported that Mr. Dresel had already received three copies
                        of this publication.</p>
                    <p>5. The Committee decided to investigate whether the German Government had
                        issued a publication giving details regarding the abdication of the Kaiser,
                        as the German press had recently given a number of new facts in regard to
                        this matter.</p>
                    <p>6. Mr. Woolsey inquired whether the Commission was in possession of a
                        certified copy of the original Armistice conditions and the conditions of
                        prolongation of the Armistice. Mr. Woolsey was informed that the Commission
                        had no such certified copy. It was decided that it was highly desirable to
                        obtain such a copy for the archives of the Department of State, and the
                        Committee decided to bring the matter to the attention of the Commissioners
                        and to suggest that a letter be addressed to Mr. Clemenceau, as President of
                        the Peace Conference, requesting him to furnish the American Commission with
                        such a certified copy of the original Armistice conditions.</p>
                    <p>7. The meeting adjourned at 2:55 P.M.</p>

                            therefore, that the Drafting Committee had decided upon the following

                        <item>Mr. Harrison reported that it was believed that the Austrian Treaty
                            could not be signed before Thursday or Friday, September 11th or 12th,
                            as Dr. Renner could not possibly return to Paris before the afternoon of
                            the 11th.</item>

                        <item>Dr. Scott inquired whether the Supreme Council had authorized the
                            Drafting Committee to work upon the Hungarian Treaty on the basis of the
                            concessions which had been made to the Austrians in the last draft of
                            that Treaty. Mr. Harrison requested a memorandum from Dr. Scott in order
                            that the matter might be presented to the Commissioners and taken up in
                            the Council if approved. Dr. Scott added that if the Drafting Committee
                            were pressed, he saw no reason why the Hungarian Treaty could not be
                            finished by the 17th instant.</item>

                        <item>The Committee suggested that it would be desirable to have the Treaty
                            for the Protection of Minorities in Czecho-Slovakia signed at the same
                            time as the Austrian Treaty. As this Treaty is in the hands of the
                            Drafting Committee, there seemed to be no difficulty in this
                            regard.</item>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Grew</hi>: I have just received a memorandum
                        dated January 9th, 1919, and signed W. L. Black, First Lieutenant, U. S.
                        Army, relative to the measures which have been directed in order to improve,
                            (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Poor elevator service, and (<hi rend="italic"

                        conditions, Lieutenant Black states that he is in receipt of the following
                        order which he requests be transmitted to all enlisted men: <quote

                            <p>“In order to relieve the congestion in the elevators, it is directed

                                and in ascending to the upper floors use either the freight elevator
                                or the stairway. Heads of departments are requested to communicate
                                this order to their enlisted personnel.</p>

                        </quote></p>
                    <p>I am not sufficiently well informed regarding the organization of the Peace
                        Conference to question by what authority Messrs. duBose and Martin issue
                        orders of this character, but my own convictions and my long training in the
                        Naval Service force me to bring to your attention the situation which is
                        being created, with the request that you refer it to such persons as may
                        have authority to give it consideration and to take whatever action may be
                        deemed appropriate.</p>
                    <p>There has been an effort for many years in our country to make the public
                        feel and believe that the uniform of the Army and Navy is something which
                        they should look upon as their very own, an emblem of service to the public
                        and not to individuals. With this in mind, Congress and many of the state
                        legislatures have passed laws prohibiting discrimination against the
                        enlisted men of the Army and Navy. It has been my experience that the
                        enlisted man of the Navy, and I have no doubt of the Army also, is proud of
                        his uniform and proud of his service, but it is seldom that you can find a
                        man who has not at some time noted a tendency toward discrimination against
                        him while in uniform. I beg to point out that the uniform of the enlisted
                        man of the Army and Navy is a uniform of service, not of servility, and that
                        all the men of the Navy wearing this uniform, and a large portion of those
                        in the Army, are doing so because they felt that they should do their share.
                        A tremendous percentage of these men have enjoyed the advantages of a
                        university education and training and are men of no little importance in
                        civil life. Our country prides itself upon its democratic principles.
                        Discrimination against the uniform of the country is abhorrent to me
                        personally and is certainly not in keeping with my ideas of what American
                        democracy stands for. So far as the men directly associated with me are
                        concerned, I think I may say with all due modesty, that there is not a
                        better equipped clerical staff connected with the entire Mission, either
                        from the viewpoint of ability to handle the work in hand, or from a
                        standpoint of education and training.</p>
                    <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0521"/>
                    <p>I beg that this matter be given the earnest consideration of those to whom it
                        should be submitted and that action be taken to rescind this or any other
                        orders which would tend to handicap a man in uniform who has a proper
                        appreciation of his duties and his obligations to his country.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Gay</hi>: Major Dulles and his group arrived
                        some days ago. They will be invaluable, I am sure, in the important work
                        which has to be done here. We have had some friendly discussion with Dulles
                        and the others respecting the precise way in which the group could best fit
                        into the organization of the Peace Conference. I am sure that the solution
                        which has been reached is one which you will approve. Since I last talked
                        with you in Washington the general organization of the American delegation
                        to the Peace Conference has been altered in two ways: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Messrs. Hoover, Hurley, Baruch, McCormick and Davis, who under the

                                “technical advisors”, are to form a separate organization dealing
                                with current business in the food, raw materials, shipping and
                                financial situation and, through liaison arrangement, advising the
                                Peace Commission on these matters.</item>

                            <item>At the instance of the American commissioners, the Inquiry has
                                absorbed the whole research and intelligence organization of the
                                Peace Commission organization proper; that is, whatever specialists
                                on territorial, economic, and political problems have been sent to
                                Paris by the Department of State or by the Army have been assigned
                                to the Inquiry and distributed in to the different parts of its
                                organization. This means that the Inquiry is now the general
                                division of economic, political, and territorial intelligence of the
                                Peace Commission organization. I am in charge of the Central
                                Economics Section of this Division. Aside from the Inquiry, as
                                enlarged, the Peace Commission organization includes only the
                                commissioners and their personal aides, the advisors on
                                international law and on military and naval problems, the
                                secretariat and the general executive organization.</item>

                    <p>Under these conditions there were only two alternatives with respect to the
                        disposition of your group: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>They could have maintained their separate identity and could have
                                been directly attached to the other council composed of the heads of
                                the War Boards and the representative of the Treasury.</item>

                            <item>They could be absorbed in the Central Economic Office under my
                                direction.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>This situation was explained very frankly to Major Dulles and to Messrs.
                        Leith and Tower. Their decision was that their work would be more effective
                        if they were absorbed into the organization of the Peace Commission
                        proper.</p>
                    <p>It has been arranged, accordingly, that Major Dulles will remain closely
                        attached to McCormick and the other War Board heads, familiarizing himself
                        with their problems, ascertaining their needs, and advising them with
                        respect to sources of information. The other men become members of the
                        organization of the Peace Commission and as such become members of my
                        central office. Wolman and Cumberland will work directly as members of this
                        organization. Tower and Leith, I hope, will have an office so located that
                        they can easily maintain the necessary contact with the heads of the War
                        Boards.</p>
                    <p>The whole group, however, will operate as a unit. All important problems will
                        be discussed in conference in such a way that there can be joint and mutual
                        determination of the best way of handling them, whether by special
                        assignment here or by securing the information from you or from
                        organizations on this side.</p>
                    <p>I expect that many of the larger problems will have to be referred to
                        Washington and that, particularly, there will be very frequent cable
                        requests for specific information.</p>
                    <p>I trust that you will agree with me that this is a better outcome than would
                        have resulted from installing your group as a separate and distinct staff
                        outside of the Peace Commission. There are some problems, such as those
                        relating to shipping, trade, and raw materials, with which your group is
                        best equipped to deal. There are other problems, especially those bearing
                        upon territorial adjustments upon which the Inquiry has more material.</p>
                    <p>It would be highly unfortunate if it should happen that the particular
                        problem was assigned to the wrong group of men. The present arrangement
                        makes that impossible. Furthermore, the present arrangement has, I believe,
                        the unanimous approval of your group here. As the thing is worked out there
                        seems to be better chance than I had ever thought possible of accomplishing
                        that general co-ordination and centralization in which you and I have been
                        mutually interested.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                        <p>No plan of work has been prepared. Unless something is done we will be
                            here for many weeks, possibly for months. After the President’s remarks
                            the other day about a draft-treaty no one except the President would
                            think of preparing a plan. He must do it himself, and he is not doing
                            it. He has not even given us a list of subjects to be considered and of
                            course has made no division of our labors.</p>
                        <p>If the President does not take up this matter of organization and
                            systematically apportion the subjects between us, we may possibly have
                            no peace before June. This would be preposterous because with proper
                            order and division of questions we ought to have a treaty signed by
                            April first.</p>
                        <p>I feel as if we, the Commissioners, were like a lot of skilled workmen
                            who are ordered to build a house. We have the materials and tools, but
                            there are no plans and specifications and no master-workman in charge of
                            the construction. We putter around in an aimless sort of way and get
                            nowhere.</p>
                        <p>With all his natural capacity the President seems to lack the faculty of
                            employing team-work and of adopting a system to utilize the brains of
                            other men. It is a decided defect in an executive. He would not make a
                            good head of a governmental department. The result is, so far as our
                            Commission is concerned, a state of confusion and uncertainty with a
                            definite loss and delay through effort being undirected.</p>

                        morning by an address of welcome and you as ranking delegate will be

                        that have occurred to me.</p>
                    <p>I would speak of the privilege it is to be here at Paris in the center of
                        French Civilization under such circumstances and for such purposes. I would
                        say something regarding Paris as an ancient city, and speak of this event as
                        the crowning glory of her history.</p>
                    <p>I would say that the eyes of the world are upon us watching anxiously. We are
                        trusted, else we would not be here, but the people have been tricked in the
                        past so many times that they cannot feel secure in this instance. They will
                        be impatient at delay after nearly <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0524"
                        />five years of the agony of war, and they are looking eagerly towards the
                        day when the world shall be again released and under conditions which it is
                        hoped will bring about a better and more enduring international society.</p>
                    <p>I would suggest that the windows be left open so that the people may hear,
                        not indeed all our deliberations, but, at least, before those deliberations
                        have become fixed conclusions and have assumed concrete form.</p>

                        reached me only this morning, the 19th. That I am heartily in accord with
                        the views expressed in your letter, regarding the use of elevators by
                        enlisted men, may be seen from the fact that on January 15th I wrote to the
                        Executive Officer of the Commission<note n="3" xml:id="d189fn3">Letter not
                            printed.</note> stating that I strongly disapproved of the order in
                        question, and asking him to reconsider it. His reply, dated January
                            17th,<note n="4" xml:id="d189fn4">Not printed.</note> explained that the
                        intention had been to direct hotel employees to use the freight elevators or
                        stairways, and that the notice, as it was actually published, had been
                        published without his final approval. Furthermore, he explained that at that
                        time, January 17th, it had already been canceled. The officer responsible
                        for the actual publishing of this notice, without its first having been
                        submitted to me for approval or disapproval, has been relieved of his
                        duties.</p>
                    <p>Regretting that this action should have resulted in inconvenience to your

                                should be postponed for separate consideration not alone by the
                                victorious belligerents but by all the nations, if and when at some

                    <p>1. At the request of the officers of the Newspaper Correspondents’
                        Association, I am enclosing herewith a copy of the resolutions adopted at
                        the recent meeting relative to publicity of the Peace Conference. It is a
                        response to the statement of the Peace Conference on the same subject issued
                        last Thursday [<hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>].<note n="7" xml:id="d192fn7"

                        <head><hi rend="italic">Resolutions of American Press
                            Representatives</hi></head>
                        <p>The American press delegation acknowledges receipt of the reply of the
                            Peace Conference to the resolutions addressed to them.</p>
                        <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0527"/>
                        <p>The delegation notes that the decision that “representatives of the press
                            shall be admitted to the meetings of the full Conference” is an
                            acceptance of the principle of direct press representation for which the
                            press of America, Great Britain, Italy and the smaller nations
                            contended.</p>
                        <p>The value of this principle, however, turns upon the extent and frequency
                            of its limitations in practice. The Peace Conference announces its
                            intention to limit it to the extent that “upon necessary occasions the
                            deliberations of the Conference may be held in camera”. Without assent
                            on our part to this limitation, we trust that if ever it is applied the
                            public will be advised through the press at the outset of each session
                            in camera of the subject to be discussed and the name of the delegate or
                            delegation making the motion to go into camera; and at the close of the
                            session the conclusions or agreements reached.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that we have not been advised to the contrary, we
                            necessarily assume that any rule designed to prohibit communication
                            between individual delegates and the press on the subjects of the
                            Conference has now been abrogated; and that the press is to have access
                            to verbatim records of the proceedings.</p>
                        <p>We call the attention of the Peace Conference to our request for not
                            fewer than five direct press representatives at each session of the
                            Conference and we submit that, because of the manner in which the
                            several press associations serve the newspapers of America and because
                            of the attendance upon the Conference of numerous individual press
                            representatives, American newspapers cannot carry on their business of
                            informing their vast public with fewer than five.</p>

                        essential principles of democratic states;</p>
                    <p>That no state should discriminate in the matter of public rights against any
                        of its nationals by reason of race or religious belief, whether nationality
                        is acquired by birth, marriage or naturalization;</p>
                    <p>That an individual possesses the right of expatriation and having become a
                        legally naturalized subject or citizen of another state and sworn allegiance
                        thereto owes no allegiance to the state of his origin;</p>
                    <p>That individuals in the exercise of their public or private rights should not
                        be permitted to advocate anarchy which is destructive of all rights, or to
                        organize for the purpose of overthrowing law and order, on which the
                        exercise of public and private rights depends;</p>
                    <p>That the political domination of a class of society for its own interest and

                    <p>The establishment of the Paris home of the American Commission to Negotiate
                        Peace necessitated the taking over and the operating of a large hotel and of
                        two office buildings nearby, the setting up of courier, telegraph, cable,
                        mail, telephone and transportation services, the securing of a large staff
                        of experts in many lines and a large number of enlisted men of the Army. The
                        work has grown until it is now far beyond the original estimates. At the
                        time of organization of the Commission when it was necessary to arrange for
                        office furniture, desks, stenographers, motor transportation, and similar
                        needs even before the size of the Commission had been determined upon, the
                        best that could be done was intelligent guessing. The original estimate, for
                        example, of 150 enlisted men has constantly been revised until today it is
                        several times that number. The requirements for office space have grown
                        until 4 Place de la Concorde has proven inadequate, and additional offices
                        have had to be secured at 3 Rue Royale. Similarly, accommodations at the
                        Hotel Crillon have been so used up that many members of the Commission have
                        had to be quartered at nearby hotels. The personnel for the many different
                        and specialized activities has come, in large part, from the Army
                        notwithstanding the non-military character of the work. Among the officers
                        and enlisted men in the service are many whose previous civil life
                        experience had fitted them for the work to be undertaken, and who could
                        easily be located by the system of qualification cards. It was strongly
                        advisable, therefore, from the standpoint of economy and expedition to draw
                        this personnel from men already in France rather than to bring over a
                        corresponding number of men from the United States.</p>
                    <p>Most of the work of the operation and maintenance of the Paris home of the
                        American Commission to Negotiate Peace is under the direction of Captain R.
                        C. Patterson, Jr., of New York City, Executive Officer of the Commission,
                        assisted by Captain C. N. Peacock and Mr. John Wattawa. The Executive Office
                        has under it the following sub-divisions: General Business Managership of
                        the Commission, Hotel Crillon Managership, Auditing and Purchase,
                        Construction and Repair, Building Superintendency, Telephones, Printing,
                        Supplies, Personnel, Headquarters Detachment, Transportation, Courier
                        Service, Photography and Post Office Service.</p>
                    <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0534"/>
                    <p>The General Business Managership of the Commission, one of the sub-divisions
                        of the Executive Office, is in direct charge of Major George P. duBose. In
                        this sub-division are placed the following sections: Hotel Managership,
                        Auditing and Purchase, Construction and Repair, Building Superintendency,
                        Telephones, Photography and Supplies.</p>
                    <p>The Hotel Crillon, fronting on the Place de la Concorde, the most beautiful
                        square in Paris, is the center of the Commission’s activities. The best
                        features of the French hotel have been retained with many purely American
                        features such as a buffet luncheon and an American barber shop added. The
                        conventional French “petit déjeuner” of coffee or chocolate, rolls and
                        confiture, has been replaced by a real American breakfast served to 300
                        persons daily. The very difficult problem of labor has been solved by
                        keeping the French personnel as nearly intact as possible, especially in the
                        cuisine and dining room, and also by placing a large number of American
                        enlisted men in positions where they are useful. Lieuts. W. L. Black and
                        Charles C. Walker, formerly manager and assistant manager of one of New
                        York’s largest hotels respectively, are in charge of the Hotel Crillon
                        Managership section.</p>
                    <p>The Auditing and Purchase section maintains an intricate system of accounts
                        due to the fact that part of the supplies are bought in the open market in
                        Paris, part secured from Army Supply Depots, and part shipped direct from
                        the United States.</p>
                    <p>The section, Construction and Repair, under Captain H. R. Shepley, is
                        maintained to keep the buildings and quarters occupied by the American
                        Commission in proper order and condition. The work of this section is
                        co-ordinated more or less with that of the Superintendency of Buildings in
                        charge of Lieut. T. W. Scott.</p>
                    <p>The American telegraph and telephone systems originally installed by the
                        Signal Corps have had to be greatly enlarged to carry the mass of material
                        sent over the wires. As a result a joint system of land wire, radio, wire,
                        and cable connects all the American interests in Europe. The occupied
                        territory in the East, Marseilles in the South and Brest, St. Nazaire,
                        Bordeaux and Liverpool in the West are connected with Paris, and across the
                        Atlantic with the United States. In Paris alone a personnel of over 100 men
                        is required to conduct the flow of wire traffic coming in and out of the
                        Commission. From any one of the telephones at the Hotel Crillon, long
                        distance telephones are possible to London, Coblenz, Brest or Bordeaux, or
                        to any of the other Signal Corps exchanges in France. Within Paris itself,
                        two modern American telephone extensions have been established, one for
                        President Wilson’s immediate entourage at the Murat Palace Hotel, and the
                        other for the Hotel Crillon and its office buildings. From these exchanges
                        telephone service is given directly <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0535"
                        />to four other American exchanges in Paris without the necessity of passing
                        through the French central. 25 extra telephone operators brought over from
                        the United States assure speed in making connections, not only with the
                        American systems, but because of the operators’ knowledge of the French
                        language, with the French systems also. This service was originally
                        installed by Colonel John J. Carty, formerly Chief Engineer of the American
                        Telephone and Telegraph Company, with Captain A. L. Hart now in direct
                        charge.</p>
                    <p>The Printing Section handles all printed matter for the Commission. The
                        printing itself is done at the Central Printing Plant of the Quartermaster
                        Corps in Paris. Preferred service is given to requests from the Commission,
                        and the material is turned out with the least possible delay.</p>
                    <p>All matters of supplies are handled by the Supplies section directly in
                        charge of Lieut. Kilpatrick and assistants.</p>
                    <p>Captain Whitney Newton, Jr. is in charge of the Personnel Section, which also
                        includes the Transportation section. All matters pertaining to personnel of
                        the Commission including civilians, commissioned and enlisted men of the
                        Army and Navy, field clerks, and Marines, are handled by the Personnel
                        Section which in general acts as a clearing house in all matters pertaining
                        to personnel.</p>
                    <p>The transportation needs of the Commission are cared for by 52 motor cars,
                        including 15 limousines and 15 sedans. Sixteen machines are definitely set
                        aside for the exclusive use of the Commissioners and other important
                        officials, while the other machines are pooled for other officials having
                        immediate important business. For the handling of supplies such as food and
                        coal two light Ford trucks and six trucks of from 1½ to 6 tons capacity are
                        on hand. This section is in charge of Lieut. Kloeber.</p>
                    <p>The Headquarters Detachment Section of the Executive Office, under Colonel E.
                        G. Peyton has charge of enlisted men assigned to the Commission. This
                        detachment is unique not only because it includes men from every branch of
                        the Army and Marine Corps, but also because of its many duties including
                        private secretaryships, stenography, bookkeeping, auditing, linotyping,
                        printing, coding, plumbing, automobile driving, electrical work and so on.
                        Practically all of these men have seen active service at the front, some for
                        18 months or more and a large number have been wounded. The Headquarters
                        Detachment assists in policing the quarters occupied by the Commission.</p>
                    <p>In addition to wire and postal facilities there is also the Courier Service
                        which connects the Commission not only with points in Paris, but also with
                        the most important centers in Europe and with Washington and New York. This
                        section is in charge of Major A. J. Peaslee, with 42 officers as assistants.
                        To maintain local service in <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0536"/>Paris,
                        a corps of courier sergeants leaves 4 Place de la Concorde every hour from 9
                        A.M. to 10 P.M., following definite routes which include the President’s
                        residence, the American Embassy, Naval Headquarters, Headquarters District
                        of Paris and the Central Printing Plant. The service is also maintained to
                        carry official messages to any point in Paris not on the regular hourly
                        routes, and to carry special messages which are too important to wait until
                        the next regular courier. For points outside of Paris officer couriers are
                        employed who make their journeys by rail, boat or motor car as the case may
                        necessitate. There is a service twice daily to General Headquarters of the
                        A. E. F. at Chaumont, and to the French General Headquarters at Metz, one
                        daily to the 125 Army post Offices, and to Berne, Rome, Brussels, The Hague,
                        London, Milan, Padua, Tours, and to British Headquarters at Montreuil.
                        Almost every third day an officer courier leaves for New York and
                        Washington. The time consumed by this trans-atlantic trip runs from 7½ days
                        to two weeks.</p>
                    <p>The Photography section, under the superintendency of Lieut. Scovell, is also
                        attached to the Executive Office to handle the photography needs in
                        connection with the work of the Commission.</p>
                    <p>Every effort to minimize delay in sending written communications to the
                        United States has been made by the establishment of a special army post
                        office, officially known as A. P. O. 702, but usually called the Commission
                        post office. This post office is equipped with money order, registry and
                        stamp departments, and with a courier service. The personnel is made up
                        entirely of enlisted men from nearly every branch of the service who have
                        been wounded and reclassified for postal service. Lieut. L. N. Cobbledick is
                        in charge of this section of the Executive Office. The official closing time
                        for the day’s mail is 5:30 P.M. when the mail is sorted, tied in separate
                        packages according to destination, placed in sealed pouches and taken to the
                        station by automobile. There it is placed on board a waiting mail car of the
                        Postal Express Railway Mail Service, bound for the port from which the next
                        fast steamer sails. When the pouches arrive at New York City they are sent
                        direct to the Chelsea terminal. This service is open to any one who cares to
                        use it. In connection with this office a branch office of the Base Censor of
                        the A. E. F. under Capt. B. F. Yates has been established to assure
                        censorship as directed in General Orders 145 and 210 of purely military
                        matters.</p>
                    <p>In brief, the Executive Office of the American Commission is the division of
                        Service and Supply. The Executive Office is also charged with the smooth
                        running of the organization of the Commission. These duties make its work
                        vital to the success of the Commission as a whole.</p>

                    <p>The work of some divisions of the American Commission to Negotiate Peace is
                        so inefficient that there should be complete reorganization and rigid
                        economy. If we are getting poor service from a large staff at a high cost,
                        let us reduce the staff and the cost. If the service remains poor, at least
                        we shall not be wasting money on it; and the conviction is growing that if
                        we had fewer officers about we would be able to do more work.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">It is specifically recommended:</hi></p>
                    <p>1) That the following divisions be abolished and the officers in them
                        returned to duty in the army or sent home:</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The Personnel Division. (Present staff: 11)</p>
                    <p>For this division there should be substituted a force of three persons,
                        working under the direction of Captain J. T. Adams in cooperation with Mr.
                        McNeir, the Disbursing Officer.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">b</hi>) The Liaison Division. (Present staff: 19)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">c</hi>) The Ceremonial Office. (Present staff: 3)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">d</hi>) The entire military group, including General
                        Churchill and his staff, and the so-called Combat Situation Section.
                        (Present staff: 27)</p>
                    <p>The offices of General Churchill and the Combat Situation Section should be
                        placed outside the Hotel, and the maintenance and work of this force should
                        not be a charge against the Commission.</p>
                    <p>It should be possible for the President to request Secretary Baker to
                        establish in Paris a Military Intelligence office, which <pb n="502"
                            xml:id="pg_502" facs="0538"/>can be run in any way that the Secretary
                        directs, since he would be responsible for both the costs and the results.
                        It is impossible to prevent the growth of any military group on the
                        Commission to an absolutely absurd size. I am convinced that only the
                        complete detachment of the Commission from the army will reduce costs and
                        increase efficiency.</p>

                    <p>This service has proved itself incapable of management of the pass system of
                        these two buildings. Two people have come into this building within the past
                        two weeks, one at 7:30 in the morning and another at 2:30 in the morning,
                        and walked through the lobby without meeting a single person, with the front
                        door open without guard. The getting of passes to the buildings has been
                        accompanied by every form of inconvenience and delay that one could
                        imagine.</p>

                    <p>Unless these missions are recalled at the end of a few weeks and close study
                        given to their reports and the results of their efforts, there will be heavy
                        calls for more money and more men and the gathering of perfectly useless
                        material will take place. After a time the men get too detached from the
                        work of the conference, and the value of their work decreases very
                        noticeably. In spite of the very high importance of the results of the
                        Austrian mission, I very much doubt if it will be of any real value to the
                        peace conference in a few weeks more. Any unexpended balance remaining to
                        the credit of these missions should be turned back to the Commission.</p>

                        <item>The questions now coming before our Commissioners all have strategic
                            permutations that cannot be safely overlooked. Yet oversights of this
                            kind must occur so long as there are no arrangements within the
                            Secretariat for their supervision, as at present. It was for this
                            purpose, presumably, that I was ordered to duty with the Commission. I
                            have not been so used, and it is impracticable for me to function in
                            this regard unless I am informed of the nature of the questions arising
                            and when they are to be considered.</item>

                        <item>The personnel and organization of the important foreign Commissions
                            indicate that their Commissioners are adequately supported in this

                            entrée to enable me to analyze the strategic permutations of questions
                            about to come before our Commissioners. To determine how this may best
                            be done, I suggest a conference with you.</item>

                            Assistant Secretary of the U. S. Treasury.</note> [from Davis, Lamont,
                        and Strauss]. While Strauss and Lamont were in transit, Davis cabled you
                        regarding (1st) numbering cables, and (2nd) removal of all records to Paris
                        and arrangements for getting needed information from London. See cables D–25
                        and D–5.<note n="15" xml:id="d207fn15">Neither printed.</note></p>
                    <p>Organization now consists of Davis, Lamont, Strauss, Jeremiah Smith, Loree,
                        Cook, Whitney and sufficient stenographers.<note n="16" xml:id="d207fn16"

                        probably remain, but status not settled. Cables are coded by Ammission. Cook
                        has just arrived after having closed London office. He and Loree are dealing
                        with daily cables, but Loree is taking his family back to New York next week
                        and cannot, until his arrival there, tell if he can return. Davis, Lamont,
                        Strauss, with Smith as Counsel, will keep each other thoroughly posted and
                        consult on all matters daily. Work of Mission here is done through
                        Committees, American membership of which is settled by President, who has
                        appointed Davis on Committee for Reparation of Damages and Armistice
                        Committee. Strauss, besides other more temporary tasks assigned to him,
                        while in transit, was named on Finance Committee. Members of Committees can
                        designate alternates and we expect to conduct our affairs interchangeably,
                        Lamont to act on Armistice Committee, Davis on Reparation, Strauss on

                        financial questions by Secretary of Treasury, is fully understood by all and
                        Davis has heretofore succeeded by insisting on this view in warding off
                        numerous requests for advances. Lamont has been laid up with influenza, but
                        is well now. Strauss has gone to most meetings with Davis, getting
                        acquainted with people and organization. These meetings have so multiplied
                        recently that there has been practically no time to draft cables posting you
                        generally, which we hope to find time for shortly. The Supreme War Council
                        has set up a Supreme Economic Council consisting of representatives of five
                        principal powers, on which President has named for United States, Davis,
                        Hoover, McCormick, Hurley, Baruch. Supreme Economic Council constituted
                        under following resolution of Supreme War Council: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    dealt with on behalf of the United States and the Allies by
                                    civilian representatives of these governments experienced in
                                    such questions as finance, food, blockade control, shipping and
                                    raw materials,</item>

                                    may determine from time to time. The Economic Council shall

                    <p>Supreme Economic Council, like all other interallied bodies, can only act by
                        unanimous consent. Financial questions to come before Economic Council are
                        likely to be limited to relief questions, also methods in which Germany and
                        Austria will pay for food or kindred questions. Davis will not of course act
                        without your instructions in any cases except where your views or
                        instructions have been communicated.</p>
                    <p>All Inter-Allied questions are becoming more and more Armistice questions or
                        Peace Treaty questions, consequently present Inter-Allied bodies are
                        referring more and more problems to Supreme War Council which has neither
                        time nor organization to deal with them. Supreme Economic Council is
                        therefore intended as a sort of Executive Committee of Supreme War Council
                        to settle questions on which after discussion unanimous consent may be
                        obtainable leaving, it is hoped, only a few clear-cut issues to be presented
                        for decision.</p>
                    <p>We have taken every occasion to impress on all National representatives that
                        we meet, the limits on power of the United States to <pb n="507"

                        limitations and also impossibility of placing unlimited Liberty Bonds and
                        have urged them to induce their merchants and bankers to make private
                        arrangements with American business men, encouraging them with our opinion
                        that credit and investment markets in the United States if properly
                        cultivated can probably deal with all needs for purchases in the United
                        States. Davis, Lamont, Strauss.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I wish to submit the following
                        observations: Most of the severe attacks which have been made on the Peace
                        Conference, and on the President, have been based on the charge that little
                        progress was being made toward actual peace, demobilization, et cetera.</p>
                    <p>Now that the President has gone, I think that there should be even fuller
                        publicity of the activities of the Conference than before, for it seems to
                        me very necessary that we should avoid having it appear that his departure
                        means delay, and that things are being held up, and the peace of the world
                        postponed, as the opposition, I am sure, will say, pending his return to
                        Paris.</p>
                    <p>I would suggest, therefore, that the American Delegation, at least, give out
                        everything possible as to what it is doing, and as to the progress of events
                        generally.</p>

                    <p>20. The memorandum I received containing account of conversation between
                        British Chief of Staff and Foch was sent Feb. 19 in regular cipher on
                        account of its length. Clemenceau, Balfour and I were to have had a
                        conference at ten o’clock this morning to discuss plans for speeding up work
                        of Conference. Clemenceau was shot at nine o’clock so conference had to be
                        abandoned. French have changed their position and now desire to hurry the
                        signing of peace. I believe their change of position may be explained by
                        realization that their own army is becoming demoralized. Amount of
                        compensation mentioned by Foch is far less than sum contended for by French
                        Treasury which is demanding that costs of war be assessed against Germany. I
                        am doing everything possible to hasten work of Conference so that upon your
                        return terms of preliminary peace will be ready for your consideration.</p>

                            and the French respecting boundaries of Germany. Tardieu, who, since
                            attack on Clemenceau, has become more prominent, said to me yesterday
                            that France would be willing to have the Rhinish Republic set up only
                            for a limited period of years, at the end of which the population would
                            be permitted to decide for themselves what their future should be. He
                            said that in this way a breathing space would be given us all and France
                            would secure protection until she recovered from the present war. The
                            principle of self-determination would be in this way safeguarded.</item>

                        <item>It now seems possible that we shall arrive at a solution of the
                            reparation matter which we can accept without abandoning the principle
                            accepted by Germany and the Allies at the time of the Armistice. In the
                            event however that this principle is seriously threatened with <pb

                            may be wise for us to intimate that as we do not wish to impair in any
                            respect the agreement between the Associated Governments and Germany at
                            the time of the Armistice we would prefer to withdraw from any
                            participation in any recovery from Germany except to the extent of our
                            own claims for reparation which we can satisfy out of the funds in the
                            hands of the Alien Property Custodian. If this intimation is given it
                            may be that the Allies will reconsider their position.</item>

                            them. If this procedure is followed it ought to be possible to summon
                            the Peace Conference for a date not later than the first week of
                            April.</item>

                        <item>An inquiry was also made by the Secretary General of the Peace
                            Conference as to whether the American Delegation intend to print the
                            American text of the minutes of such committees and commissions. This
                            matter is in direct connection with the production of mimeograph copies
                            of the minutes, which are now being made as a result of the conference

                            of the minutes of the meetings in the English language, which
                            consequently it will be necessary for you to submit to his office,

                            committee or commission. May I venture to direct your attention to the
                            fact that these final reports should be prepared in <hi rend="italic"
                                >printed</hi> form for consideration by the Peace Conference, and
                            that a sufficient number of copies in the English text should be at hand
                            for the use of the members of the American Commission at least
                            twenty-four hours before the matter is to be taken up for consideration
                            by the Conference. This may also be worked out in collaboration with
                            your British colleague, if such action is found practicable.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The text of the printed copy of the final report will be official and
                            will, as mentioned on last Wednesday morning, agree exactly with the
                            sense of the official text of the copy printed in the French language.
                            The number of printed copies of these reports which should be furnished
                            to the Secretary General of the Peace Conference will depend upon his
                            needs therefor, but without knowing exactly how many he may require, I
                            would suggest that one hundred copies be placed in his hands at a time
                            not less than twenty-four hours before the session at which the report
                            will receive consideration.</item>

                    <p>913. Personal and confidential for President Wilson from Vance McCormick.</p>
                    <p>My conferences with Belgians and French have impressed me with the very great
                        desirability of your landing on your return at Antwerp and proceeding to
                        Paris through Belgium and invaded regions of France. I feel that far more
                        than local considerations would be involved in such a procedure and that it
                        would beneficially affect political forces which cannot be ignored. There
                        has been a distinct improvement in the atmosphere here at Paris within the
                        last fortnight and I believe that announcement of your intention to return
                        via Belgium and Northern France would go far toward maintaining our
                        relations with France and Belgium on this more favorable basis. I also point
                        out that you may consider it preferable to make your second landing in
                        Europe in a country which you as President have not yet visited and where a
                        new welcome would accordingly be awaiting you. I have talked this over with
                        Colonel House who heartily approves.</p>

                        <item>George is desirous of arranging his engagements so that he can be in
                            Paris at a time most advantageous from your standpoint. He can either
                            come the later part of this week and remain here for about a week or can
                            be here on about March 14th and remain here for approximately ten days.
                            His Labor Committee is expected to report on March 20th but he can
                            probably put off receiving this report for five or six days at the most
                            provided he is engaged in Conference in Paris during that time. I
                            suggest that you authorize me to express to him your hope that he arrive
                            on March 14th and stay as long as practicable. Please cable me as soon
                            as possible respecting this matter.</item>

                        <item>Last Monday night Pichon and Klotz called on me. They were very much
                            disturbed over the French financial situation and stated that unless
                            England furnished France with some sterling exchange almost immediately
                            there would be a serious break in the price of the French franc with
                            disastrous results. They stated that the British Chancellor of the
                            Exchequer would come to Paris if he could see me <pb n="517"
                                xml:id="pg_517" facs="0553"/>for a conference respecting this
                            matter. I agreed to see him at any time he came. On Thursday at noon
                            Klotz, Tardieu and other French Treasury officials called on me and
                            asked me to intervene at once with England so that France would be
                            furnished immediately with a few million pounds of sterling exchange to
                            tide them over until the Chancellor of the Exchequer could come to Paris
                            for conference. I promised to do what I could. I at once took steps to
                            point out Lloyd George the unfortunate effect which would be caused by
                            French financial difficulties at this time and I urged that some
                            sterling exchange be given the French to tide them over their
                            difficulties. George directed that this be done. Klotz expressed deep
                            gratification of French Cabinet for this assistance. British Chancellor
                            of the Exchequer will come to Paris early next week for
                            conference.</item>

                    <p>7549. Department desires to call your attention to the fact that the Embassy
                        is not keeping it advised of the general attitude of the French Press, and
                        more especially the reported changes in sentiment towards the American
                        program in the League of Nations. The American correspondents in Paris are
                        sending daily reports on this subject, and it is therefore embarrassing that
                        the Embassy has failed to keep the Department advised. Call your attention
                        in particular that no report was made as to attacks on our program which led
                        to threat of moving Peace Conference.</p>

                        <item>1. Unless you think I should come more immediately to Paris I shall
                            land at Antwerp and go from there to Bruxelles and from Bruxelles
                            through the devastated regions arranging it from Lille to Paris. I
                            believe that I can be confident of reaching Antwerp by the 14th and
                            should be in Paris some four days later. I would be obliged if General
                            Harts would arrange the motor transportation through the devastated
                            regions.</item>

                            made, and I am quite willing, if he wishes me to do so, to come direct
                            to Paris by Brest, and I hope that you will say to him that I regard it
                            as of the highest importance that we should constantly have the benefit
                            of his counsel and guidance. Please let me know as soon as possible
                            whether the Antwerp plan should be given up and my visit to Bruxelles
                            made later.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>We note what you say about the house we are to occupy and the
                            insistence of the French Government that we should be its guests. We
                            find that it will not be possible to bring a complete set of servants
                            and think it on the whole unwise to attempt to bring a few. We would be
                            very much obliged therefore if you would arrange through the French
                            Government for reliable servants.</item>

                    <p>12. After receiving your No. 1, I got in communication with Lloyd George by
                        telephone. He thinks that it is essential for you to come <pb n="519"
                            xml:id="pg_519" facs="0555"/>directly to Paris as soon as possible. His
                        difficulties with the coal miners and other laborers culminates around the
                        24th or 25th of March and it will be necessary for him to return to England
                        by then. If you arrive in Paris by the 13th or 14th we both believe it may
                        be possible to settle the preliminary peace terms with Germany by the 23d
                        and name a day for the regular peace congress in which the Central Powers
                        are to participate. I have April 2d tentatively in mind for the assembling
                        of the Congress. The preliminary peace terms for Austria should also be
                        ready early in April. The Brussels trip can be taken during the interim
                        between the calling of the Peace Congress and its date of assembling. I am
                        glad you are not bringing your servants. The French Government are holding
                        those you had at the Hotel Murat intact for you.</p>

                    <p>At the meeting of the Commissioners this morning, Mr. White read a telegram
                        which had been received from the naval authorities regarding the proposal
                        that the President land at Antwerp.<note n="25" xml:id="d226fn25">Not
                            printed.</note> This telegram mentioned that while the mine fields in
                        the English channel were largely cleared up, there was still some danger
                        from mines, and that the navigation of the Scheldt was as yet very difficult
                        for a vessel of the size of the “George Washington”. The naval authorities
                        recommended that if the President made the trip as contemplated, he should
                        land at Flushing and proceed by destroyer to Antwerp. The Commissioners were
                        unanimous in the decision that they could not assume the responsibility for
                        advising the President to take a trip which involved an element of danger.
                        Mr. Lansing pointed out that it would be out of the question to touch at
                        Flushing, which was Dutch territory.</p>

                            administration of the government, to imperil the financial interests of
                            the railways systems of the country, and to make arbitrary use of powers
                            intended to be employed in the interests of the people.</p>
                        <p>It is plainly my present duty to attend the Peace Conference in Paris. It
                            is also my duty to be in close contact with the public business during a
                            session of the Congress. I must make my choice between these two duties,
                            and I confidently hope that the people of the country will think that I
                            am making the right choice. It is not in the interest of the right
                            conduct of public affairs that I should call the Congress in special
                            session while it is impossible for me to be in Washington, because of a
                            more pressing duty elsewhere, to cooperate with the Houses.</p>

                        <p>I take it for granted that the men who have obstructed and prevented the
                            passage of necessary legislation have taken all of this into
                            consideration and are willing to assume the responsibility of the
                            impaired efficiency of the government and the embarrassed finances of
                            the country during the time of my enforced absence.</p>

                        <p>The reply of Dr. Clive Day and Dr. W. L. Westermann, members of the
                            Committee on Greek Claims, to the above noted inquiry is quoted in full
                            as an annex to this memorandum. (See Annex “A”)</p>
                        <p>The reply of Captain Stuart Montgomery, Secretary of the Polish
                            Commission states that it is believed that the report of that commission
                            adheres to the President’s principles in an entirely reasonable manner.
                            He explains that the report consists of two main sections (Sections 2
                            and 3), both of which were prepared by Dr. Bowman, and accepted by the
                            British and French Delegations. (See Annex “B”)</p>
                        <p>The following commissions have not reported:— <list>

                        <p>In regard to the reports submitted by the Belgian and Danish Territorial
                            Commission the Secretary, Mr. Frank L. Warrin, Jr., stated by telephone
                            that the report relative to the Treaty of 1839 recently adopted by the
                            Council of Ten as submitted by this commission contains no violations of
                            the President’s principles. He said that the second report of the
                            commission was not as yet sufficiently advanced to admit of a statement
                            on the question at hand.</p>

                        <p>With reference to your memorandum of March 11th, instructing me to
                            report, before the arrival of the President, in what respects if any the
                            report of the Polish Commission violates or does not violate any of the
                            President’s declarations, and the justification therefor, I beg to say
                            that it is believed that the report of the Commission <pb n="526"
                                xml:id="pg_526" facs="0562"/>adheres to the President’s principles
                            in an entirely reasonable manner.</p>
                        <p>This statement is considered to be all the more justified because the
                            report of the Commission consists of two main sections (Sections two and
                            three), the first of which deals with the principles which guided the
                            deliberations of the experts in determining the boundaries, and the
                            second the application of the principles to special cases.</p>
                        <p>In addition the fact may be noted that both these paragraphs were
                            prepared by Dr. Bowman, and accepted by both the British and the French
                            delegations, and that in the preparation of these sections the
                            President’s principles were always kept in mind.</p>

                    <p>7701. That I might have before me Press comments upon the significance of his
                        return and what his presence again at the Conference will mean, I have
                        delayed reporting upon the reception of President Wilson on his arrival in
                        Paris yesterday. I believe his coming has been at heart more wished for by
                        the real lovers of France than one can see from the surface. The large crowd
                        assembled at the station gave him a hearty welcome. I get this view from the
                        talks I have had with a number of prominent Frenchmen who with a clear
                        vision have come to understand the importance if not the necessity of having
                        Mr. Wilson’s counsels in determining the great problems which now demand the
                        most prompt solution. The Marquis de Chambrun, member of the Chamber of
                        Deputies who as member of the Foreign Affairs Committee is in a position to
                        know the frame of mind of his colleagues, voiced this sentiment very
                        strongly the other day. He told me in a long and frank talk that he was glad
                        to see the evidence of a better understanding of Wilson’s plan for helping
                        France. He explained quite fully the reasons for his belief. Having
                        expressed a desire for an appointment several days ago, this morning M.
                        Leygues Minister of Marine, who is one of the most high minded and able men
                        in public life came to the Chancery to see me. His encomiums of Mr. Wilson
                        were as sincere as they were generous, for I have known M. Leygues as a warm
                        friend almost since I came here. He told me that I might rely on the fact
                        that the French people as well as the Government had entire confidence in
                        the wisdom of President Wilson and his unselfish plans for maintaining peace
                        among all nations. What has been my own conviction for a long time past that
                        a number of the French papers were printing partisan and distorted
                        despatches from their Washington correspondents <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527"
                            facs="0563"/>who were influenced by Republican partisans in Washington,
                        there being evidence that there was a studied political campaign being
                        carried on by such means to be exerted over here, was corroborated by M.
                        Leygues.</p>
                    <p>I stated in a former recent telegram that I had observed evidences which I
                        rather sensed than being actually told that the President was coming to be
                        understood as quite as good a friend of France in times of peace as he had
                        been in war. That this feeling has a very substantial foundation, I believe
                        more firmly than ever. Much has been done to remove the scales from the eyes
                        of those over here who had not before understood the real difference between
                        the position of the President and that of his opponents by the open
                        declaration of his opponents at home in favor of isolation of the United
                        States from European Affairs. I do not expect any serious opposition over
                        here from now on, as one was so evidently for their interests and the other
                        against them.</p>
                    <p>Like the <hi rend="italic">Petit Parisien</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Gaulois</hi>, some of the papers of the largest circulation and of the
                        greatest influence display a genuine welcome toward his coming that betokens
                        a feeling that he is greatly needed. The following quotation from the
                        journal <hi rend="italic">L’Avenir</hi> of this morning perhaps bears out
                        this view as succinctly as could be stated: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“It must be admitted even by those who regarded Mr. Wilson as a
                                rather embarrassing person that things have stagnated since his
                                departure. When Mr. Wilson is not here there is no society of
                                Nations and nothing can be done without this society. This
                                stagnation of things is due largely to the fact that the solution of
                                pressing difficulties can only be approached from a point of view
                                which he alone knows how to defend with conviction and
                                authority.</p>
                            <p>France must state the problem as it really is. The society should at
                                first consist of a moral and material alliance between the great
                                Entente countries.”</p>

                    <p>1188. In reply to urgent request to Legations Berne, Hague and Copenhagen for
                        frequent cable reports on conditions in Germany, Austria and Hungary,
                        Legation at Berne replies that it has no means at its disposal for
                        collection such information, as its staff has been so reduced to meet the
                        requirements of the Mission to Negotiate Peace. The Legation suggests that,
                        inasmuch as the American Peace Mission has sent special missions of
                        investigation to different portions of Central Europe comprising, in several
                        instances, former members of the Legation staff who are in constant
                        telegraphic communication with Paris, the information desired by the
                        Department be supplied by some person attached to the Mission at Paris, who
                        will make it his business to keep the Department informed. The Department
                        has no current information regarding conditions and developments in Germany,
                        Austria, Hungary, Poland, Lithuania, Czecho-Slovakia, or Yugo-Slavia, and
                        because of the depletion of the staffs of the Legations adjacent to Central
                        Europe for the use of the Mission, I am unable to call upon those Legations
                        to supply desired reports regarding Central European conditions. May not
                        arrangements be made whereby some one on the Mission staff can be assigned
                        to furnish the Department with comprehensive cable summary and mail copies
                        of important telegraphic and mail reports received by the Mission from its
                        representatives in Central Europe and Russia? Would greatly appreciate an
                        early reply.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: May we bring to your
                        attention a matter, which has come to the notice of the Commission,
                        concerning the feeling which has arisen among the Delegates of the Latin
                        American countries against the action of the Council of Ten in not giving
                        them more ample representation on the Financial and Economic
                        Commissions?</p>
                    <p>When the above mentioned Commissions were formed it was decided by the
                        Council that the lesser powers should have five delegates from their number
                        on each of the Commissions. A meeting of these powers was held under the
                        Presidency of Mr. Cambon, and resulted in a request for more representation
                        on each Commission.<note n="31" xml:id="d236fn31">See minutes of the
                            meetings of the powers with special interests, <ref
                                target="frus1919Parisv03#pg_447">vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">iii</hi>,
                                pp. 447</ref> ff.</note> One or two other meetings were subsequently
                        held in which an attempt was made to make a list which would be satisfactory
                        to both the lesser European Powers and to the Latin American nations. The
                        attempt failed and a vote was taken in which the Latin American Delegates
                        supported by China and Siam, had a majority and elected as representatives,
                        a majority of Latin American Delegates, with only two or three Europeans.
                        This list was not accepted by the Council of Ten and representatives of the
                        lesser powers were chosen by it, giving six places on the Financial
                        Commission and seven places on the Economic Commission to the European
                        nations, but including Brazil on the latter Commission. This left Panama, a
                        belligerent, and Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia without representation on any of
                        the various Commissions, producing very hard feelings against the Great
                        Powers.</p>
                    <p>A crisis has now come and various meetings have been held by the Latin
                        American delegates in which some of them have gone so far as to say that
                        they considered that an insult had been given to Latin America and that to
                        protect themselves from the arbitrary acts of the Great Powers, they should
                        withdraw from the Conference and possibly try to make a separate peace with
                        Germany. There were also remarks made to the effect that if such an action
                        as this on the part of the powerful nations was to be an indication of what
                        the Great Powers would do in the League of Nations, it was best for them not
                        to enter the League.</p>
                    <p>Unless the Council of Ten will make some further concessions to the Latin
                        American countries, such as giving Panama and Peru representation on either
                        the Financial or Economic Commissions, if it is not possible to give places
                        to Ecuador and Bolivia also, coupled with <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532"
                            facs="0568"/>an appropriate statement, setting forth that there was no
                        intention to treat the Latin Americans in an arbitrary manner, the feeling
                        of resentment will undoubtedly react most unfavorably on the cause of the
                        Associated Governments, and may give an opportunity for German propaganda,
                        which is only dormant in South and Central America, to work on their
                        feelings and impair the work which is being done at the Conference.</p>
                    <p>The actual importance to the lesser Latin American nations of having
                        representation on either Commission is probably very slight, but the pride
                        of various governments seems to have been hurt for the reason that although
                        they were invited to send delegates to the Conference, their delegates were
                        not allowed a place on any of the Commissions.</p>
                    <p>As the United States is represented in the Council of Ten, it comes in for
                        its share of the resentment against the Great Powers and our relations with
                        Latin America may be seriously impaired if we do not do all in our power to
                        better the situation.</p>

                        <p>The following suggestions are submitted with regard to the form and
                            nature of the forthcoming Treaty of Peace with Germany.</p>
                        <p>War, i. e. the state of belligerency, cannot be brought to an end more
                            than once. If the forthcoming treaty is to enable the transition of the
                            Allied countries to a peace footing to be carried through, and
                            demobilization to be completed, it should put an end to the state of
                            war.</p>
                        <p>Demobilization may deprive the Allied Powers of the power to apply <pb
                                n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0569"/>further coercion to Germany,
                            consequently reference should be made in the forthcoming treaty to all
                            matters affecting the enemy Powers for which provision is to be made in
                            the Peace Settlement. Matters which have been worked out in detail can
                            be dealt with in detail in the treaty. Matters which have not by then
                            been worked out in detail should be provided for by imposing upon the
                            enemy acceptance of the principle agreed upon by the Allies and by
                            stipulating that the principle is to be worked out in detail after the
                            treaty has been signed.</p>
                        <p>Subjects which can only be dealt with in principle in the first treaty
                            will probably be fairly numerous, and it will be convenient that the
                            documents containing the detailed arrangements which may be come to for
                            carrying the principle into effect should ultimately be collected and
                            annexed to some second treaty or convention to be signed by all the
                            parties.</p>
                        <p>Questions which are purely inter-allied need not be included in the
                            forthcoming treaty. This will give the Allies more time to arrange
                            matters between themselves. In practice it will probably be found
                            convenient to make the settlement with the enemy comprehensive, and to
                            include in it the arrangements to which the enemy must be a party and
                            also those which it is convenient that he should have no <hi
                                rend="italic">locus standi</hi> for contesting afterwards.</p>
                        <p>If the above suggestions are approved there is no need to call the
                            forthcoming treaty the <hi rend="italic">Preliminary</hi> Treaty of
                            Peace as there will only be one. Peace will have been made once and for
                            all. The second instrument to which the detailed arrangements are
                            annexed can be called the Final Act.</p>
                        <p>So far as one can judge at present, if the plan outlined above were
                            adopted, the treaty of peace with Germany might be arranged as
                            follows:—</p>

                    <p>1331. Department’s 1188, March 19, 7 p.m. Ammission cannot understand
                        allusion to former members of Berne Legation staff being in constant
                        telegraphic communication with Paris from different parts of Central Europe.
                        Special information missions now operating under directions of Commission or
                        on their way are: one, Austro-Hungarian mission including also Poland; two,
                        Southern Russian mission; three, Baltic Provinces Mission. None of these
                        includes service diplomats nor at present in any case any person who has
                        been attached to any Embassy or Legation during the war.</p>
                    <p>Referring to depletion of Legation staffs for use of Mission. Ammission in
                        view of great mass of diplomatic and political correspondence has found it
                        necessary to establish a special division in charge of persons with
                        diplomatic experience to handle the material and they are kept exceedingly
                        busy. This division includes two members of diplomatic service from Berne
                        Legation staff and three clerks from Berne. The Berne Legation has
                        emphasized the decrease of work there and willingly assented to the transfer
                        of this personnel. Besides these the Division includes one member of The
                        Hague Legation staff. In addition to these one member of The Hague Legation
                        and one of the Berne Legation act as secretaries to Commissioners and
                        Osborne shortly expected here from Copenhagen. It is not thought that this
                        utilization of members of the Central Europe missions is unreasonable or
                        excessive in view of great and increasing volume of work here.</p>
                    <p>As far as Germany is concerned for reasons fully explained in Ammissions 921,
                        February 26, 9 p.m., the Mission has been withdrawn. Detailed written
                        reports from members of German party have only just been compiled and will
                        be promptly forwarded by courier. Ammissions 968, February 27, represents
                        latest direct news of real importance from observers in Germany. If another
                        mission goes in Ammission will not fail to keep Department fully informed by
                        cable.</p>
                    <p>Referring Austro-Hungary and other missions same course of forwarding written
                        reports and telegraphing summaries of important information is being pursued
                        and will be carefully followed up.</p>

                    <p>The Commission comprises the following departments. There are also certain
                        associated bodies which perform, in some degree, services for the Commission
                        but also are engaged in work wholly unconnected with any of the functions of
                        the Commission. The following is a brief, suggestive description of the
                        scope of these departments and associated bodies, with the numbers of
                        personnel. The staff of the President is not included: <table rows="165"

                        <p>I am sure now that there will be no preliminary treaty of peace, but that
                            the treaty will be complete and definitive. This is a serious mistake.
                            Time should be given for passions to cool. The operations of a
                            preliminary treaty should be tested and studied. It would hasten a <pb
                                n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0584"/>restoration of peace. Certainly
                            this is the wise course as to territorial settlements and the financial
                            and economic burdens to be imposed upon Germany. The same comment
                            applies to the organization of a League of Nations. Unfortunately the
                            President insists on a full-blown Covenant and not a declaration of
                            principles. This has much to do with preventing a preliminary treaty,
                            since he wishes to make the League an agent for enforcement of definite
                            terms.</p>
                        <p>When the President departed for the United States in February, I assumed
                            and I am certain that he had in mind that there would be a preliminary
                            treaty. With that in view I drafted at the time a memorandum setting
                            forth what the preliminary treaty of peace should contain. Here are the
                            subjects I then set down: <list>

                        <p>The President’s obsession as to a League of Nations blinds him to
                            everything else. An immediate peace is nothing to him compared to the
                            adoption of the Covenant. The whole world wants peace. The President
                            wants his League. I think that the world will have to wait.</p>

                        <p>After the experience of the last three months [January–March, 1919] I am
                            convinced that the method of personal interviews and private conclaves
                            is a failure. It has given every opportunity for intrigue, plotting,
                            bargaining, and combining. The President, as I now see it, should have
                            insisted on everything being brought before the Plenary Conference. He
                            would then have had the confidence and support of all the smaller
                            nations because they would have looked up to him as their champion and
                            guide. They would have followed him.</p>
                        <p>The result of the present method has been to destroy their faith and
                            arouse their resentment. They look upon the President as in favor of <pb
                                n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0585"/>a world ruled by Five Great
                            Powers, an international despotism of the strong, in which the little
                            nations are merely rubber-stamps.</p>
                        <p>The President has undoubtedly found himself in a most difficult position.
                            He has put himself on a level with politicians experienced in intrigue,
                            whom he will find a pretty difficult lot. He will sink in the estimation
                            of the delegates who are not within the inner circle, and what will be
                            still more disastrous will be the loss of confidence among the peoples
                            of the nations represented here. A grievous blunder has been made.</p>

                                note more general in character which follows: …”</note></head>
                        <p>Everywhere there are developing bitterness and resentment against a
                            secretiveness which is interpreted to mean failure. The patience of the
                            people is worn threadbare. Their temper has grown ragged. They are sick
                            of whispering diplomats.</p>
                        <p>Muttered confidences, secret intrigues, and the tactics of the “gumshoer”
                            are discredited. The world wants none of them these days. It despises
                            and loathes them. What the world asks are honest declarations openly
                            proclaimed. The statesman who seeks to gain his end by tortuous and
                            underground ways is foolish or badly advised. The public man who is sly
                            and secretive rather than frank and bold, whose methods are devious
                            rather than obvious, pursues a dangerous path which leads neither to
                            glory nor to success.</p>
                        <p>Secret diplomacy, the bane of the past, is a menace from which man
                            believed himself to be rid. He who resurrects it invites condemnation.
                            The whole world will rejoice when the day of the whisperer is over.</p>

                        investigations, as well as with the conduct of political matters, that they
                        should suggest any subject which they might think advisable for inclusion in

                        after you left. He was perfectly delighted with what I was able to tell him
                        concerning the Syrian-Armenian matters, and the period of occupation.</p>
                    <p>I took occasion to ask him if he had signed the Russian Memorandum. He said
                        he had not but would do so. He thought that Pichon had it. He rang for his
                        secretary giving instructions to have it brought to him. I find, however,
                        that it is in Hoover’s hands and I am sending it to you under this cover so
                        you may have Clemenceau sign it this morning.<note n="38" xml:id="d242fn38"

                        between our two countries—a condition which I was sure he did not wish. He

                        himself upon any of the great questions before the Conference. I shall await

                    <p>All are to have subsistence while attached to Conference, salary till they
                        reach home, and transportation home.</p>
                    <p>The following are promised in addition salary to July 1st, but subsistence
                        only, of course, while here: Clive Day, C. H. Haskins, Mark Jefferson, D. W.
                        Johnson, A. K. Lobeck, P. T. Moon, Charles Seymour, W. L. Westermann.</p>
                    <p>Assistants, clerks etc., are mainly from the Army, so they could no doubt be

                        will not be allowed any readjustments requiring further study, the

                    <p>After the signing of the Armistice, when it was found necessary to organize
                        the Peace Commission, it was determined that the Commission would depend
                        upon the Army for staff assistance, drawing from the A. E. F. all the
                        personnel required to meet stenographic and clerical needs, as well as
                        depending upon the A. E. F. for cartographers, book-keepers, chauffeurs,
                        orderlies, guards, etcetera. The Army, too, was to furnish certain officers
                        expert in given lines, other officers from the intelligence organizations,
                        others to act as aides to the Commissioners, others to be in liaison between
                        the Commission and the French Government offices and between the Commission
                        and the various peace delegations. Consequently the civilian staff brought
                        from the Department of State was small, including, all told, four officials,
                        four confidential clerks, five cipher clerks, and three other clerks.</p>
                    <p>An estimate was made in Washington of the number of assistants needed from
                        the Army and this was cabled to Paris and the Army <pb n="558"
                            xml:id="pg_558" facs="0596"/>was asked for aid. The estimate proved far
                        too low, as did estimates generally concerning the personnel needs of the
                        organization, and as one office after another was added to the Commission
                        the Army was constantly called on for additional help.</p>
                    <p>In studying the personnel of the American Commission to Negotiate Peace it is
                        first of all necessary to consider certain handicaps under which the
                        Commission labors. First of all is the fact that the organization was formed
                        over night, to meet an urgent need, and in a foreign country where there
                        were not available many things to facilitate operations which would have
                        been at hand in any American city.</p>
                    <p>An equally important factor is the character of offices available. The
                        Commission took over the Hotel de Crillon, facing the Place de la Concorde,
                        No. 4, Place de la Concorde, and a portion of the premises at No. 3, Rue
                        Royale, which adjoin and connect with “No. 4.” The Crillon is at one end of
                        a structure extending the whole square. “No. 4” is at the other, a hundred
                        feet away, and separated by two other buildings. The whole is an ancient
                        structure. The interior of the Crillon has been modernized and constitutes a
                        first-class hotel. “No. 4” is a large rambling building, evidently modelled
                        and remodelled many times, until there are in it a hundred rooms from the
                        largest 34 x 45 feet to the smallest 6 x 8. There are a score of floor
                        levels, a dozen stairways and so many passages that even those familiar with
                        the building find it difficult to make their way about. The building at 3
                        Rue Royale is much the same—mostly small rooms and very much cut up.</p>
                    <p>Were it possible to have the whole Commission installed in one modern
                        building the personnel problem would be much simpler. It would be possible
                        to get along with many fewer stenographers and orderlies, considerable
                        duplication of work could be avoided and the personnel could probably be
                        cut, considering everything, including guards and watchmen by from
                        seventy-five to a hundred people. The quarters, however, were the best
                        available unless the Commission took over one of Paris’ biggest hotels,
                        which would have been a far more elaborate and expensive proposition.</p>
                    <p>At first it was planned that all offices, with the exception of those of the
                        Commissioners themselves, should be in No. 4. It was soon found that this
                        was impossible, even with the preliminary organization, and it became
                        necessary to convert many of the rooms in the Crillon into offices until
                        thirty-five per cent of the rooms available were made into offices. Most of
                        these are over-crowded. No. 4 is likewise crowded, the figures showing that
                        there are only about forty square feet to a person throughout the
                        building.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Personnel.</hi></p>
                    <p>The personnel of the organization is of three kinds: Civilian, Army and
                        Naval. The civilians are mainly administrative and advisory, <pb n="559"
                            xml:id="pg_559" facs="0597"/>with a few stenographers and clerks and a
                        score of telephone operators. The bulk of the personnel from the Army is
                        clerical. The Navy personnel consists of Naval advisors, their aides, naval
                        orderlies, and the Communications Office, consisting of twenty-five
                        officers, all of them code experts, and forty-six men who do the typing and
                        clerical work connected with keeping up telegraphic and radio
                        communication.</p>
                    <p>In January a Personnel Committee was formed for the purpose of scrutinizing
                        every application made by any office for additional personnel and also to
                        examine the existing organization with a view to eliminating anyone not
                        needed. Later another Committee was formed, which included Mr. White and
                        General Bliss, two of the Commissioners, the purpose of which was to still
                        further examine the personnel of the organization with a view to
                        eliminations wherever possible. A very careful examination of the whole
                        organization has been made since the formation of those committees and not
                        only have the services of many officers and men been dispensed with, after
                        examination, but the investigation resulted in numerous offices cutting down
                        personnel voluntarily, and in general keeping a careful watch on
                        personnel.</p>
                    <p>The investigation showed that in several instances the functions of offices
                        which were important at the outset had, with the process of organization,
                        disappeared, and their usefulness finished. Whenever this was found to be
                        the case the offices were reduced or abolished. This has happened with
                        respect to the Military Liaison Office which now has a personnel, including
                        clerical, of four, where before it was thirteen, the Combat Section which
                        now has a personnel of three against seventeen, the Political Liaison which
                        has been reduced from seventeen to nothing at all except that two of the
                        officers have been transferred to other departments.</p>
                    <p>The greatest portion of the Commission’s personnel is composed of enlisted
                        men of the army and with respect to their large numbers there are one or two
                        most vital points which must be considered. First of all is the fact that it
                        is necessary for the Army to feed and quarter all of these men and to look
                        after their discipline. The men all belong to what is known as the
                        Headquarters Detachment, a regular military organization, with a colonel
                        commanding and with twelve other officers on duty with the men. This is a
                        strictly military organization, set up and operated by the Army and devised
                        to afford the best means of caring for the men on duty with the Commission.
                        The men are quartered in barracks a couple of miles from the Place de la
                        Concorde and sleep there. There are Army messes at the barracks and at “No.
                        4” where the men get their meals. The detachment includes the requisite
                        number of cooks, guards, battalion non-commissioned officers, barbers,
                        tailors, et cetera, needed by a <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0598"
                        />military organization of its size, all engaged in the duty of looking
                        after whatever military regulations require, but none of them having
                        anything directly to do with the business of making peace. This is cited to
                        show the futility of endeavoring to balance the Commission’s total personnel
                        with the number of civilians which would be required for an equal quantity
                        of work, but who would look after themselves.</p>
                    <p>Another important point in considering the numbers of men on the personnel
                        rolls concerns the character of assistance which the Army has furnished.
                        Army officers themselves freely admit that soldiers in offices do not turn
                        out the volume of work that civilians accomplish. For whatever reason, this
                        appears to be true here, and the note is made with the fullest appreciation
                        of the splendid work which most of the soldiers are doing and the pride that
                        they take in it and in being attached to the Commission. Most of the
                        soldiers, however, are Class B and C men, many of them who have been wounded
                        or gassed, and not capable of performing as great a volume of work as if
                        they were entirely well. Further, for the first two months of the
                        organization, the conditions under which they lived were deplorable—a damp
                        barracks, badly lighted and without proper ventilation, sanitary facilities
                        or sleeping quarters. This has led to a great deal of illness, in a climate
                        where the percentage is high anyhow. This condition, however, has shown much
                        improvement lately. But for a considerable period the men, as a body, were
                        unhappy and forlorn, and incapable of their best work.</p>
                    <p>The result of illness is that a certain surplus of men must be kept on hand
                        to take the places of men who become incapacitated. These, some of them,
                        remain idle for a day at a time. In any business in America this would, of
                        course, be impracticable and unnecessary. No business house would think of
                        such a system. In this connection it must also be considered that the loss
                        to the Government of detaining such men here is nil, for if the men were not
                        in Paris they would be elsewhere. If these particular individuals were
                        permitted to go home they would only take the places on transports of other
                        individuals on transports who would have to remain in France until
                        transportation became available. They may as well be in Paris as somewhere
                        else in France. Where men have had a chance of returning to the States, the
                        Commission has supported their applications.</p>
                    <p>Another important phase of the personnel question concerns the necessity of
                        utilizing soldiers in the upkeep of the hotel and of the office buildings.
                        Elsewhere this would not arise. Here there are soldiers who run the
                        elevators, operate telephones, do fatigue duty, attend to the furnaces,
                        serve as electricians, plumbers, car dispatchers, et cetera, to say nothing
                        of the score who operate the small printing <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561"
                            facs="0599"/>plant which the Commission has taken over. The necessity of
                        employing only American citizens in all of the work of the Commission swells
                        the military personnel, as other Americans are not available.</p>
                    <p>Still another consideration is that in some cases offices are kept running
                        twenty-four hours a day, which means double or treble shifts of men.</p>
                    <p>Following is an analytical report, office by office, of the personnel
                        employed:</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">President Wilson:</hi></p>
                    <p>Total personnel—15.</p>
                    <p>There are nine civilians, including secret service men, and stenographers.
                        There are two commissioned Army officers, two commissioned Naval officers,
                        and one enlisted man.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Commissioner Lansing:</hi></p>
                    <p>Total personnel—13.</p>
                    <p>Of the civilians, one is an assistant; another a confidential secretary; and
                        the third a stenographer. There is one commissioned officer who is an Aide.
                        The enlisted personnel includes a chauffeur and hall orderlies, who are
                        worked in shifts.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Commissioner White:</hi></p>
                    <p>Total personnel—12.</p>
                    <p>One civilian, a member of the Diplomatic Service, who acts as an Assistant to
                        Mr. White. There is one Military Aide; three field clerks, who are
                        stenographers; and the remainder orderlies, who work in shifts.</p>

                    <p>Total personnel—32.</p>

                        enlisted Navy, and one enlisted Marine. This office looks after the bulk of
                        the Presidential correspondence, which is voluminous, and this accounts for
                        the magnitude of the personnel.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Commissioner Bliss:</hi></p>

                        stenographers; the remainder are office assistants, guards, and
                        orderlies.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary General:</hi></p>

                    <p>Includes four civilians, who are office assistants, one Naval Lieutenant, who
                        also serves as Mr. Grew’s representative on certain committees; one Naval
                        Yeoman, who is a stenographer; while the remainder are office assistants, or
                        orderlies.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Diplomatic Secretary:</hi></p>

                        other sections under his jurisdiction. There is one civilian, who is
                        Confidential Secretary, and one orderly.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">General Military Liaison:</hi></p>
                    <p>Total personnel—2.</p>

                    <p>Total personnel—13.</p>
                    <p>This office handles the diplomatic and political correspondence of the
                        Commission. Its civilian members, numbering eight, include experts on
                        various subjects; the Chief of the Diplomatic Bureau of the Department of
                        State; three commissioned officers, each an expert; and two
                        stenographers.</p>

                    <p>This office handles all cipher and code messages in and out of the
                        Commission. It is open twenty-four hours a day, and the men work in watches.
                        It is purposely fully staffed in order to meet the maximum requirements.
                        About one-third of the business of the communications office is devoted to
                        transmitting and receiving messages to Mr. Hoover’s organization. It is
                        desirable that these communications be handled by this office, although Mr.
                        Hoover’s work is not wholly Peace Commission work, but is really
                        international. If such work were eliminated, the personnel could doubtless
                        be reduced by twenty men.</p>

                        verbatim reports of all plenary sessions of the Peace Conference. It is a
                        pool of stenographers to be drawn upon.</p>

                    <p>The personnel of some of the offices enumerated below are carried on the
                        Peace Commission rolls, although they are not directly attached to the Peace
                        Commission, nor is their personnel properly chargeable to the Commission.
                        However, there is, in each case, an association which warrants a record
                        being kept by the Commission.</p>
                    <p>Attached to the Commanding General, District of Paris—total 12. Includes
                        eleven officers, and one enlisted man. While these officers have been
                        engaged in looking after the President, they are not directly attached to
                        the Commission.</p>
                    <p>Courier Service Officers—total, 81—all commissioned. This comprises the
                        courier service between Paris and numerous points in Europe where American
                        Missions are stationed. A similar service would have to be maintained
                        whether the Peace Commission existed, or not, although not such an extensive
                        service as this. Prior to America’s entry into the War, such a courier
                        service was maintained by the Department of State.</p>
                    <p>Field Observers—total 77. Civilians, eight; Army commissioned, thirty-two;
                        Navy commissioned, nine; field clerk, one; Army enlisted, twelve; Navy

                        American Missions in Poland, Austria, Russia, Turkey, and elsewhere. While
                        under the supervision of the Commission, they are working generally for the
                        United States Government, and in reality the Missions afield take the place
                        of certain Embassies and Legations.</p>
                    <p>Financial Commissioner—total 14. Includes eleven civilians, one commissioned
                        army officer, and two enlisted men. While the Financial Commissioner is a
                        Technical Adviser of the Commission, he is also the representative in Europe
                        of the Treasury Department, and <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0605"/>a
                        considerable portion of his personnel is devoted to United States Government
                        work, rather than that of the Commission.</p>
                    <p>Headquarters Detachment—total, 297. Includes twelve commissioned Army
                        officers, two hundred and eighty one enlisted men, one commissioned Marine
                        officer, and three Marine enlisted men. The headquarters detachment includes
                        all of the officers and men essential to the maintenance of a military
                        organization. It furnishes certain orderlies to the Commission, as well as
                        the outside guard at Hotel Crillon and “No. 4”. Its officers are engaged in
                        strictly military duties, looking after the discipline of the men, their
                        feeding, and the “paper work” of the organization. The figures include
                        cooks, barbers, tailors, organization non-commissioned personnel, et
                        cetera.</p>
                    <p>Historical Branch, War Plans Division—total 2. Both Army officers, engaged in

                        Department for historical purposes.</p>
                    <p>Post Office—total 16. Includes two commissioned Army officers, one civilian,
                        and eleven enlisted men (Army), and two Marine enlisted men. The Post Office
                        handles the mail for the entire organization, including a great quantity of
                        soldier mail.</p>
                    <p>Shipping Board—total 18. Includes twelve civilians, four commissioned Army
                        officers, and two enlisted men. Like the office of the Financial Adviser,
                        this is an associate body, but not actually a part of the Peace Commission.
                        The office, like that of the Financial Adviser, existed before the formation
                        of the Peace Commission.</p>
                    <p>Supreme War Council—total 4. Includes three commissioned Army officers, and
                        one field clerk. Another associate body.</p>

                        Army enlisted men, one civilian, and eighteen women operators. Engaged in
                        installation and telephone service.</p>
                    <p>Transportation—total 106. Includes six civilians, four commissioned Army
                        officers, and ninety-six enlisted Army men. This force handles all
                        transportation, passenger, and otherwise; runs twenty-four hours a day;
                        cares for the cars, and operates the garage. It includes waitresses employed
                        at the men’s mess.</p>
                    <p>War Industries Board—total 1[<hi rend="italic">14</hi>]. Includes nine
                        civilians, four commissioned Army officers, and one enlisted man. Another
                        associated body, with dual functions, which is not entirely chargeable to
                        the Peace Commission.</p>
                    <p>War Trade Board—total 10. Includes seven civilians, two Army enlisted men,
                        and one Navy enlisted man. Another associate body not entirely chargeable to

                        <p>The terms of peace were yesterday delivered to the German
                            plenipotentiaries, and for the first time in these days of feverish rush
                            of preparation there is time to consider the Treaty as a complete
                            document.</p>
                        <p>The impression made by it is one of disappointment, of regret, and of
                            depression. The terms of peace appear immeasurably harsh and
                            humiliating, while many of them seem to me impossible of
                            performance.</p>
                        <p>The League of Nations created by the Treaty is relied upon to preserve
                            the artificial structure which has been erected by compromise of the
                            conflicting interests of the Great Powers and to prevent the germination
                            of the seeds of war which are sown in so many articles and which under
                            normal conditions would soon bear fruit. The League might as well
                            attempt to prevent the growth of plant life in a tropical jungle. Wars
                            will come sooner or later.</p>
                        <p>It must be admitted in honesty that the League is an instrument of the
                            mighty to check the normal growth of national power and national
                            aspirations among those who have been rendered impotent by defeat.
                            Examine the Treaty and you will find peoples delivered against their
                            wills into the hands of those whom they hate, while their economic
                            resources are torn from them and given to others. Resentment and
                            bitterness, if not desperation, are bound to be the consequences of such
                            provisions. It may be years before these oppressed peoples are able to
                            throw off the yoke, but as sure as day follows night the time will come
                            when they will make the effort.</p>
                        <p>This war was fought by the United States to destroy forever the
                            conditions which produced it. Those conditions have not been destroyed.
                            They have been supplanted by other conditions equally productive of
                            hatred, jealousy, and suspicion. In place of the Triple Alliance and the
                            Entente has arisen the Quintuple Alliance which is to rule the world.
                            The victors in this war intend to impose their combined will upon the
                            vanquished and to subordinate all interests to their own.</p>
                        <p>It is true that to please the aroused public opinion of mankind and to
                            respond to the idealism of the moralist they have surrounded the new
                            alliance with a halo and called it “The League of Nations,” but whatever
                            it may be called or however it may be disguised it is an alliance of the
                            Five Great Military Powers.</p>
                        <p>It is useless to close our eyes to the fact that the power to compel
                            obedience by the exercise of the united strength of “The Five” is the
                                <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569" facs="0607"/>fundamental principle of
                            the League. Justice is secondary. Might is primary.</p>
                        <p>The League as now constituted will be the prey of greed and intrigue; and
                            the law of unanimity in the Council, which may offer a restraint, will
                            be broken or render the organization powerless. It is called upon to
                            stamp as just what is unjust.</p>
                        <p>We have a treaty of peace, but it will not bring permanent peace because
                            it is founded on the shifting sands of self-interest.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Grew</hi>: I find that I shall not retain
                        the least shred of respect for myself if I let the moment pass without
                        protesting most vigorously against the treaty which has been presented to
                        the German plenipotentiaries. This treaty, it seems to me, will by wronging
                        Germany make her eager for revenge; it will foster the Prussian spirit in
                        the countries whose power will give it its only sanction; it will stand as a
                        monument of shame above the graves of the millions who suffered and died in
                        the greatest of all wars. I may add that I have <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570"
                            facs="0608"/>spoken to many persons about the treaty, and that none
                        express approval, while but few attempt extenuation. The opinion is general
                        that the treaty with Austria will be even worse.</p>
                    <p>In view of my feelings as expressed above, it is possible that the Commission
                        may no longer wish to continue my services, and if such action is taken I
                        should be glad to be returned home.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">From: A. A. Berle, Jr.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">To: Mr. Grew (for the Commissioners).</p>
                    <p>After reading the summary of the terms of the proposed German treaty, and
                        examining its text, I feel bound in honor to place on record my protest
                        against American acquiescence in it.</p>
                    <p>The American war was declared, supported, and fought to a victorious
                        conclusion on and for certain fundamental principles, stated by the
                        President, to the attainment of which the United States pledged itself. The
                        treaty as prepared seems in large measure to have abandoned both letter and
                        spirit of these pledges. The abandonment seems to include not merely the
                        compromises necessary to achieve a humanly workable scheme, but in many
                        cases, a surrender of the principles involved. In certain striking instances
                        (notably the Japanese clauses), the treaty threatens also to create a
                        situation thoroughly dangerous to the interests of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Bearing in mind the difficulty of securing persons acquainted in detail with
                        the subject matter of my present duties, and having no desire to hinder the
                        work here in any way, I leave to the Commissioners the question of my
                        continued connection with the Commission. My single desire is to serve
                        faithfully the United States, and to assist in realizing, so far as
                        possible, the ideals expressed by the President prior to the proposal of the
                        treaty. But, (if by no other considerations), the honorable fulfilment of my
                        oath as a United States officer would constrain me to a statement that
                        conclusion of the proposed treaty will not, in my judgment, serve either the
                        idealistic or material interests of America, or, indeed, of humanity.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Grew</hi>: I feel impelled by my own
                        conscience to register in some manner a protest against the terms of peace
                        which have been proposed to Germany. The United States entered the European
                        War for the maintenance of certain principles of international justice
                        clearly expressed by our President. Inspired by those ideals, we have borne
                        great sacrifices in the hope that a better world would emerge as a result.
                        Consideration of the terms of this peace leaves me with a profound sense of
                        disillusionment.</p>
                    <p>We have bartered away our principles in a series of compromises with
                        interests of imperialism and revenge, until hardly a shadow of them remains.
                        Instead of assuring the peace of the world by a just reconstitution, this
                        treaty seeks guarantees for a settlement in favor of the victors which
                        reduces the vanquished to powerless and indefinite servitude. Such a
                        settlement assures neither permanence nor tranquility. My earnest conviction
                        is that our country dishonors itself in adding its signature and
                        guarantee.</p>
                    <p>If, in view of these opinions, my services should be no longer desired, I
                        shall be glad to be relieved from my duty with the Commission.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Grew</hi>: I should like to express to you,
                        and, through you, to the members of the American Peace Commission, my
                        sentiments on the Peace Settlement which is under way. I have found that my
                        feelings are echoed by a surprisingly large number of persons connected with
                        the American Commission.</p>
                    <p>I feel that the Peace, as proposed, will be an exceedingly dangerous
                        settlement,—if it could be called a ‘settlement’,—of world affairs. I
                        believe it to be provocative of future wars, rather than a guarantee of
                        world peace. I believe it will stir up strife among the nations, rather than
                        allay it. I feel that the idealism of America has been very largely
                        sacrificed on the altar of imperialism. One need not go beyond the mention
                        of Shantung to establish his case.</p>
                    <p>I have endeavored to be as useful as possible to the Commission, but I feel
                        that that usefulness is largely at an end, and I put my services at your

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I have submitted today
                            to the Secretary of State my resignation as an Assistant in the
                            Department of State, Attache to the American Commission to Negotiate
                            Peace. I was one of the millions who trusted confidently and implicitly
                            in your leadership and believed that you would take nothing less than “a
                            permanent peace” based upon “unselfish and unbiased justice”. But our
                            Government has consented now to deliver the suffering peoples of the
                            world to new oppressions, subjections and dismemberments—a new century
                            of war. And I can convince myself no longer that effective labor for “a
                            new world order” is possible as a servant of this Government.</p>
                        <p>Russia, “the acid test of good will”, for me as for you, has not even
                            been understood. Unjust decisions of the Conference in regard to
                            Shantung, the Tyrol, Thrace, Hungary, East Prussia, Danzig, the Saar
                            Valley; and the abandonment of the principle of the Freedom of the Seas
                            make new international conflicts certain. It is my conviction that the
                            present League of Nations will be powerless to prevent these wars, and
                            that the United States will be involved in them by the obligations
                            undertaken in the Covenant of the League and in the special
                            understanding with France. Therefore, the duty of the Government of the
                            United States to its own people and to mankind is to refuse to sign or
                            ratify this unjust Treaty, to refuse to guarantee its settlements, by
                            entering the League of Nations, to refuse to entangle the United States
                            further by the understanding with France.</p>
                        <p>That you personally opposed most of the unjust settlements, and that you
                            accepted them only under great pressure, is well known. Nevertheless, it
                            is my conviction that if you had made your fight in the open, instead of
                            behind closed doors, you would have carried with you the public opinion
                            of the world, which was yours; you <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574"
                                facs="0612"/>would have been able to resist the pressure and might
                            have established the “new international order based upon broad and
                            universal principles of right and justice” of which you used to speak. I
                            am sorry that you did not fight our fight to the finish and that you had
                            so little faith in the millions of men, like myself, in every nation who
                            had faith in you.</p>
                        <p>Very sincerely yours,</p>

                            future wars have been planted by unjust decisions of the Conference in
                            regard to Shantung, the Tyrol, Thrace, Hungary, East Prussia, Danzig and
                            the Saar Valley; and by the abandonment of the principle of the Freedom
                            of the Seas. It is my conviction that the present League of Nations will
                            be powerless to prevent these wars and that the United States will be
                            drawn into them by the obligations undertaken in the Covenant of the
                            League and in the special understanding with France.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the welfare of the American people and mankind would be
                            promoted by the refusal of the United States to sign or ratify the
                            Treaty of Peace, the League of Nations Covenant and the understanding
                            with France. Therefore, I feel unable to assist, even as a subordinate,
                            in the imposition on the world of these settlements and respectfully

                                Bulgaria may also for the same reasons contest the cession of

                                        Montenegro respectively. It is also true that the Greeks
                                        claim Albanian territory as then delimited, and that the
                                        Albanians in turn claim Greek territory. It may be useful to

                                and it might be that the peoples concerned would prefer self-help to

                            since the Treaty was passed, and under the provisions of the Treaty that
                            as between the Allies distribution of the materials, money, etc., for
                            reparation is to be settled by agreement, Great Britain agrees to waive
                            any question of title in the United States to the seized ships, and in
                            the same way agrees that Brazil, Cuba, China and Siam shall retain the
                            ships seized by them respectively provided payment is made for the
                            same.</p>
                        <p>France has agreed with the United States that it does not question the
                            United States’ title, but has not to this date agreed with relation to
                            the ships seized by the other states.</p>

                        <p>Great Britain and France have waived any question as to our title, and we
                            hope for similar agreements on the part of Italy, Greece, Japan and
                            Belgium. With such agreements we need fear no further difficulty in
                            maintaining our title. However, that as a matter of courtesy we should
                            present the matter to Greece and Belgium and possibly the other
                            countries, and will do so as soon as we have arrived at an understanding
                            with Japan.</p>
                        <p>We know of no other questions involved in the seized ships which might
                            give difficulty from the standpoint of the United States. There are some
                            rather complicated claims put forward by Italy, particularly with
                            relation to Adriatic shipping, but in this question we should not be
                            affected so far as ship tonnage is concerned.</p>

                        American Commission feel that as soon as the German Delegation has submitted
                        its reply regarding the Conditions of Peace it would be very desirable to
                        call a meeting of all the Commissioners, Technical Experts and Advisors
                        connected with the American Mission in order that the German proposals might
                        be discussed by the members of the Commission under your guidance.</p>
                    <p>In the event that you approve of this suggestion we shall be glad to take
                        steps to prepare this meeting at the time and place which you may
                        indicate.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Governor</hi>: The reason for the letter of May
                        27th which Lansing, Bliss and White composed and which I signed is this:</p>
                    <p>Hoover told me yesterday that for your own protection he strongly hoped that
                        you would do what has been suggested in this letter. I did not go into
                        details with him but I feel sure he was speaking advisedly.</p>
                    <p>I have no doubt that any view which you would take of the German objections
                        to the Treaty would be the view of every one with whom you would confer. If
                        you do not confer with them, I have a feeling that some of them will be
                        disgruntled and perhaps make trouble.</p>
                    <p>I told the Commissioners what Hoover had said to me and they proposed the
                        letter. I merely make this explanation so you will understand how it came
                        about.</p>
                    <p>Affectionately yours,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear White</hi>: Do not think because I have not
                        written to you that I have been unappreciative of your very welcome and
                        interesting letters. The fact is that I have not been at all in agreement
                        with the general course of diplomatic policy which has been followed in
                        Paris. I have felt that we occupied a very strong position before the
                        Conference. We had nothing to ask for, and everybody wanted something from
                        us which we were quite willing to give so <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589"
                            facs="0627"/>long as they behaved decently. This situation plainly
                        required on our part reserve and an avoidance of affirmatives in the first
                        instance. With my slender means of information, however, I have not felt
                        like writing letters which might make you unhappy; indeed, I have strongly
                        suspected that you and Lansing and Scott were unhappy enough as it was. Of
                        course, I may be all wrong, and you may be able easily to set me right when
                        we come to talk about it; but in the meantime I think I better not discuss
                        the subject, but simply express my strong desire to see you back again safe
                        and sound.</p>
                    <p>Please give my kind regards to Lansing and General Bliss who began his

                    <p>In response to your instructions I have taken up with Mr. Suter of the
                        Committee on Public Information the matter of suspension of their various
                        services, and submit the following report:</p>
                    <p>Mr. Creel has ordered the suspension of all activities on July 1st. This
                        involves the closing of the Paris and New York offices on June 15 in order
                        that all records and accounts may be cleared up by the end of the fiscal
                        year. This will deprive the Commission and the Government of the following
                        services: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Utilization of the Committee’s machinery, hitherto most effective
                                and useful, for the world-wide distribution of Presidential
                                speeches, Peace Commission communiques, Relief Commission
                                communiques and various other things. There will doubtless be
                                further Presidential addresses and official statements which in the
                                interests of the country will require widest distribution.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The Committee has since the beginning of the Conference
                                transmitted some thousands of words daily for American
                                correspondents to the United States by radio. A suspension of this
                                service would create a great deal of trouble with the correspondents
                                who utilize it freely and depend upon it for quick transmission, the
                                cable delays often running to sixty and seventy hours.</item>

                            <item>The Committee furnishes a daily summary of American news and
                                editorial comment on matters of interest to the Commission, <pb

                                The news summary comes by radio, the editorial comment, particularly
                                if it is critical, by the more secret cable. This service is
                                interesting and helpful. It is sent from the Committee’s New York
                                office which also attends to “broadcasting” Presidential messages,
                                to the American, Latin-American and the Far Eastern press.
                                Therefore, if that office is kept open for one purpose it can also
                                without considerable additional expense, except cable tolls, furnish
                                the news and editorial summary.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>The Committee’s London office has been closed. It furnished a
                                voluminous daily report of the English press, incorporating the news
                                sent by American correspondents of British newspapers, comprising
                                the most elaborate news service from America received in Paris.
                                Since May 31 the Commission has been without this service. This
                                office was a most important link in the system of broadcasting
                                Presidential messages, etc.</item>

                            <item>The Paris Office of the Committee attends to copying and
                                distributing all material received, from New York and from London,
                                filing outgoing material on the radio, filing Presidential and other
                                addresses, broadcasting all official statements, et cetera. It also
                                produced a review of the French press. This has been abandoned. The
                                Commission, however, has a review of its own.</item>

                        present month so far as Paris is concerned. As to New York the exact
                        situation is not known. The London Office can be reopened at once, the staff
                        not having departed for the United States, at a cost of about $300. per
                        week, exclusive of cable tolls, the amount of which would depend on the
                        quantity of material handled. The New York office would require $400.
                        weekly. The Paris office could be kept on for the $500. weekly, a total of
                        operating expenses of about $1,200. per week, exclusive of cable tolls.</p>
                    <p>It is possible that the Committee on Public Information has funds which might
                        be used for the continuation of the work until the end of the Conference.
                        This could be ascertained by telegraphing Mr. Creel, who, however, is very
                        anxious to wind up the Committee’s affairs everywhere.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Herman Suter is now in charge of the Paris office, Mr. Rogers having
                        departed, and is willing to carry on the work, although at considerable
                        personal sacrifice.<note n="48" xml:id="d262fn48">The Paris and New York

                        the adoption by the United States Government of a Russian policy
                        fundamentally opposed to my conception of what is practical toward Russia as
                        a whole, and what is just toward the Baltic states with which I have been
                        especially charged. Under these circumstances I cannot honestly or with
                        self-respect remain attached to the American Commission to Negotiate Peace
                        any longer than may be necessary to obtain the appointment of a new American
                        member to the Baltic Commission.</p>

                        <item>Now that the American policy towards Russia has been defined by the
                            correspondence with Admiral Kolchak, Russian affairs become peculiarly
                            the province of the State Department and of men whose profession is the
                            diplomatic service. This staff must shoulder the task of effectuating
                            the outlined policy and the responsibility for the measures taken.
                            Observers brought into the work during the emergency merely complicate
                            matters. Further, I find myself in the peculiar difficulty of
                            whole-heartedly disagreeing with the proposed line of action, and
                            completely unable to secure its alteration, yet as the American
                            Delegation stands committed to it, under military order to further it.
                            Under the circumstances I feel that my own usefulness is largely
                            ended.</item>

                            actually handling Russian affairs for the State Department, are both far
                            more capable than myself of interpreting the incoming

                            task is really political, it is not unreasonable to ask that no
                            distinction be made between civilian and military appointees.</item>

                        of the Presidential party, which was due at Adinkerke the following morning
                        at nine o’clock. The King and Queen of the Belgians flew to Adinkerke the
                        same afternoon. There also arrived the same evening the various Aides to the
                        King, as well as the members of the King’s household who had been attached
                        to the President and Mrs. Wilson. Baron Moncheur, General Joostens and Count
                        de Renesse were designated to attend the President, while Madame de

                    <p>The train with the Presidential party arrived on time Wednesday morning and
                        the entire party then proceeded in Belgian and American motors which had

                        been pitched and servants from the Palace had brought from Brussels, food,
                        tables, etc. After lunch they proceeded to Ypres, and thence, by way of

                        in time to take a special train to Brussels. The train left Zeebrugge at
                        6:45, arriving at Brussels at 9:15 at the Gare du Luxembourg. At the
                        station, to meet the President, were Mr. Béco, the Governor of the Province
                        of Brabant, the Burgomasters of Brussels and Ixelles, the former, Mr. Max,
                        the distinguished Mayor who had shown such courage and determination in
                        resisting the German dominion during the early days of the occupation. The
                        station platform was lined with troops, and as the train <pb n="594"
                            xml:id="pg_594" facs="0632"/>came into the station the band played the
                        “Star Spangled Banner”, while all stood at attention. After the reception
                        and presentation of certain officials the party proceeded by motors through
                        the streets, which were lined with troops and large crowds, (in spite of the
                        lateness of the hour and the growing darkness the line to the Palace was
                        massed with people), to the Royal Palace, where a presentation of the Palace
                        Officials took place.</p>
                    <p>Thursday, June 19th: At nine o’clock the President and King, accompanied by
                        their suites, proceeded on a motor trip to Charleroi and the ruined
                        factories at “La Providence”. It should here be stated that, the previous
                        days having been spent in Flanders, it was thought advisable that the
                        President should visit the Walloon country, as well, before returning.
                        Furthermore, the Belgian officials seemed anxious that the President, during
                        his brief visit, should see as much as possible of the havoc and destruction
                        deliberately wrought by the German army during the Occupation.</p>
                    <p>The party returned to Brussels in time for the luncheon arranged at the
                        American Legation, officially given by the President to Their Majesties the
                        King and Queen, which took place at 12:30. Previously to that hour, American
                        troops had taken their places, lining both sides of the street before the
                        Legation, and a military band from Base Section No. 9 at Antwerp was also
                        present. At about 12:20, as the President’s car came in sight, the
                        flourishes and ruffles were given, following Which the band broke into the
                        “Star Spangled Banner”, while the troops stood at attention. About five
                        minutes later, on the arrival of the King, the flourishes and ruffles were
                        repeated, while “La Brabançonne”, the Belgian national anthem was played. As
                        the King entered the Legation the Belgian flag was raised on a separate
                        staff beside the American flag. (For list of the guests at the luncheon see
                        enclosure 1.<note n="52" xml:id="d267fn52">Not printed.</note>)</p>
                    <p>Following the luncheon, after the departure of the King and Queen, Cardinal
                        Mercier, Burgomaster Max and other Belgian officials, the President received
                        the staffs of the Legation, Military Mission and Consulate General, after
                        which the American colony, the Belgian-American Chamber of Commerce and
                        various Belgian delegations, including representations from the Comité de la
                        Politique Nationale, the Belgian League of Nations, the Maison du Peuple,
                        etc., were presented to the President.</p>
                    <p>At 2:30 the President and Mrs. Wilson, accompanied by their Aides, together
                        with the American Minister and Mrs. Whitlock and other officials, proceeded
                        to the Parliament, where the President was received on the floor of the
                        Chamber of Deputies. A speech of welcome was <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595"
                            facs="0633"/>delivered by Mr. Poullet, the President of the Senate,
                        after which M. Hymans, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, delivered an address
                        of welcome in English. (For copies of these speeches in French see the <hi

                    <p>After the reception at the Parliament the Presidential party, and the King
                        and Queen, motored to Malines, where the President was received by Cardinal
                        Mercier in the Archbishop’s Palace. Following the reception at Malines, the
                        party proceeded to Louvain, where the Burgomaster of the town greeted the
                        President in the old Hotel de Ville in the same room in which the German
                        High Commander in 1914 had summoned the people of Louvain to unconditional
                        surrender. (For the reply of the President to the Mayor of Louvain see

                        Hotel de Ville the party proceeded to the University of Louvain, the Library
                        of which had been destroyed by the Germans, and here, among the ruins, the
                        President was presented with the degree of Doctor of Laws by the Rector of
                        the University. (For the speech of the President delivered on this occasion
                        see enclosure 4.<note n="53" xml:id="d267fn55">Not printed.</note>)</p>
                    <p>From Louvain the party returned to Brussels, going directly to the Hotel de
                        Ville, where the President was greeted by the Burgomaster and Echevins of
                        the city in the Gothic room where the old Spanish flags were still hanging.
                        The Burgomaster greeted the President on behalf of the city, after which the
                        President rose and thanked Mr. Max. (For the President’s reply to the
                        Burgomaster see enclosure 5.<note n="53" xml:id="d267fn56">Not
                            printed.</note>) After the scene in the Gothic room the President and
                        King, together with the Queen and Mrs. Wilson, appeared on the balcony,
                        where they were acclaimed by the populace in the stately Grand Place below.
                        Various singing societies of Brussels then rendered a song in their honour,
                        following which trumpeters gave a fanfare from the roofs. After this very
                        impressive and stirring ceremony the President returned to the Palace, where
                        he received the Diplomatic corps. This was immediately followed by a state
                        dinner at the Palace, at which the King proposed the toast of the President
                        and the President replied by drinking a health to Their Majesties. (For the
                        President’s greeting to the King see enclosure 6.<note n="53"

                    <p>At 11:00 o’clock the Presidential party returned to Paris by special train,
                        the route to the station again being lined with troops, and large crowds
                        being assembled to greet the President on his departure. Again the bands
                        played the “Star Spangled Banner” while the officials of the town bade him
                        farewell.</p>

                    <p>2709. [From Lansing.] The other American Commissioners consider in view of
                        the general situation that it would be wise for me to return to Washington
                        as soon as possible. In the event that I do so it would necessitate your
                        taking my place on the Commission as soon as we could have a conference in
                        Washington or New York. I would like your opinion as to the advisability of
                        my return to aid with the treaty in the Senate and an expression as to your
                        willingness to assuming the duties of a Commissioner.</p>
                    <p>So far as the duties of Commissioner are concerned I am sure that you would
                        not from now on find them arduous and that they would be an agreeable change
                        from the confining work of the Department. I am sure that the change would
                        give you opportunity for rest while the experience would be interesting and
                        useful.</p>
                    <p>This plan is not dependent entirely upon the Germans’ signing the treaty but
                        their failure to do so at once might compel some delay in putting it into
                        operation.</p>
                    <p>Please telegraph me at once your opinion which I hope will not be adverse if
                        based on personal disinclination alone. I wish you would be perfectly frank
                        in expressing your views. Lansing.</p>

                    <p>I am strongly of opinion that your presence here during debate on treaty is
                        essential. It is daily brought home to us the necessity of having some one
                        in the Department with whom friends of the administration can freely consult
                        in connection with treaty. You have confidence of Congress and can speak
                        with authority of your experience and your high office.</p>
                    <p>I am naturally deeply gratified at the suggestion of my assuming duties of
                        Commissioner and grateful for the thought. Would it be possible for me to
                        delay decision until I see you here as I would like to have some idea as to
                        how long it would take and know something about the character of work. It
                        will be necessary for me to make some plans for my family as I hesitate to
                        take five children abroad for the winter and yet do not like to leave them,
                        and I will also have to consult my doctor and get his opinion as to my
                        undertaking this work. Is it essential that your successor go over at once?
                        I hope not.</p>

                    <p>The Treaty of Peace with Germany was signed today in the Galerie des Glaces
                        of the Palace of Versailles.</p>
                    <p>The hour set for the ceremony of signature was three o’clock and promptly on
                        the hour the great assembly was opened by M. Clemenceau <pb n="598"
                            xml:id="pg_598" facs="0636"/>and before four o’clock the last delegate
                        had affixed his name to this greatest of treaties.</p>
                    <p>For two or three days there has been much anxiety about who was to see the
                        signing and who was not. The Secretariat of the Commission has had a very
                        unhappy time with the applications for tickets, and I imagine that the
                        Secretariat General of the Conference must have been nearly wild with the
                        pressure brought to bear to obtain admission.</p>
                    <p>Friday night the matter was settled, the lists revised and the tickets
                        issued. We obtained 60 tickets for the conference room, a lesser number for
                        the gallery outside, and about 50 for the grounds of the Palace. There were
                        some heart-burnings I know but that was unavoidable.</p>
                    <p>It seemed best in view of the possibility of confusion to go early to
                        Versailles, so at one o’clock Mrs. Lansing and I accompanied by Foster and
                        Allen Dulles and Captain Garfield started from the Hotel de Crillon in an
                        automobile driven by Corporal Chaveriat who had Private Seymour, my personal
                        orderly, with him. Mr. Kirk, my secretary, came in our other car with his
                        mother and some of the staff. We ran out through the Bois de Boulogne, up
                        the winding road to the terraced gardens of St. Cloud and then on to the
                        Versailles road through the forest. All along the route were French soldiers
                        with red flags to direct the way. On the windshield was pasted a circular
                        device like a target, blue in the center, then a white circle and outside of
                        that a red one. This acted as a pass. On entering Versailles the curious
                        crowds lined the way while soldiers and <hi rend="italic">gens d’armes</hi>
                        kept them back from the pavement.</p>
                    <p>We drove to the Palace by the broad approach at the front. On either side of
                        the spacious roadway was a row of cavalry in horizon blue and trench helmets
                        and carrying their long lances from which fluttered little red and white
                        streamers. Behind these rows and about 20 feet from them were poilus
                        shoulder to shoulder; and behind the poilus were dense masses of people. We
                        drew up at the entrance to the basement, where our hats were checked, and we
                        then mounted the staircase to the main floor of the Palace. On every third
                        step stood two dragoons in their white trousers, black boots, dark blue
                        coats with red facings, and glittering silver helmets with black horse tails
                        over their shoulders. They stood like statues with sabres drawn looking
                        neither to the right or left.</p>
                    <p>Passing through several ante-rooms we finally reached the Hall of Mirrors
                        where a great table extended along the inner side of the gallery with short
                        wing tables at either end. The seats of the delegates were on the outside in
                        the usual order followed at the Preliminary Conference except that delegates
                        sat on both sides of the wing tables. The place for the German delegates was
                        on the left wing table next <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0637"/>to the
                        long table. In the center of the long table was the seat of the presiding
                        officer, M. Clemenceau. Directly opposite his seat in the center of the room
                        was a gold Louis XVth table on which lay the great treaty in a case of brown
                        leather. On both sides of this table and filling all the available space
                        between the tables of the delegates were the members of the Secretariat
                        General and the Secretaries of the various Commissions. The space thus
                        occupied took up about one third of the Hall, the rest of the space being
                        filled with benches without backs, but beautifully upholstered in tapestry,
                        for spectators and members of the press, the latter being to the right of
                        Mr. Clemenceau.</p>
                    <p>When we arrived only a few people were in the room, but delegates and invited
                        guests gathered rapidly. It was about two o’clock when M. Clemenceau
                        arrived. He passed through the spectators section shaking hands right and
                        left and causing perturbation to the ushers who were making way for him and
                        who constantly got so far ahead that they had to turn back to find him. I
                        was standing near the table where the aisle ended. When he saw me his face
                        lit up with a smile and he exclaimed, “This is a great day for France”. I
                        replied, “A great day for the world, Mr. President”. I had reached out my
                        hand to shake hands, when he said, “No, give me both your hands, that is the
                        way France and America should greet each other today”. He then passed on
                        toward his seat. A little later I followed him and he turned as I passed and
                        showed me a wonderful gold pen and holder which lay in a leather case, a
                        present from some organization. I discovered that he was sitting in
                        President Wilson’s seat and pointed out the fact to him. “Oh”, he exclaimed,
                        “I am glad you told me before the President came. He might have been
                        embarrassed and I would have been very much annoyed.”</p>
                    <p>It was soon after this, as the delegates began taking their seats in
                        considerable numbers, that there began a regular field day in writing
                        autographs. Most of these were put upon the place-programs but every now and
                        then an album appeared. During this occupation the President arrived and was
                        at once deluged with requests for his signature, which he gave at first
                        willingly but later with evident unwillingness.</p>
                    <p>Soon, however, there was a stir at the entrance behind the spectators. The
                        President said, “Here they come”. Preceded by ushers and French officers and
                        followed by four or five secretaries the German Commissioners, Müller and
                        Bell came down the aisle. Their appearance was not prepossessing. Their
                        expressions were tense or possibly stolid. They were nervous and
                        unquestionably felt deeply the humiliation which they, as representatives of
                        a vanquished and hated country had to bear. They came to the table and were
                        directed to their seats by Dutasta, the Secretary General of the Conference.
                            <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0638"/>No one rose and no
                        acknowledgement of their arrival was given. I think that I would have felt a
                        deep compassion for these scapegoats of Germany, save for the fact that I
                        could not but think of the joy which would have filled their hearts if they
                        were there representing a victorious Germany with the Emperor William seated
                        in the place of “The Old Tiger” of France. It would have been an awful, not
                        a glorious, day for the world and civilization.</p>
                    <p>As soon as they were seated M. Clemenceau stood up and briefly stated that
                        the treaty was ready and that it was necessary for Germany to perform the
                        conditions, which were irrevocable. After being interpreted into English,
                        the remarks were rendered into German and, when the interpreter spoke of the
                        necessity of performance and the unchangeable character of the conditions,
                        Dr. Müller nodded his head and said in a low voice “Oui! Oui!”. In some ways
                        the scene was painful. It was as if men were called upon to sign their own
                        death warrants, fully realizing that they were at the mercy of those whom
                        they had wronged beyond the possibility of pardon. They seemed anxious to
                        get through with it and be off.</p>
                    <p>After the translation of the words of M. Clemenceau, Dutasta and Martin, the
                        fussy little head of “the protocol”, walked over to the German delegates and
                        conducted them to the table where lay the treaty, open at the place where
                        they were to sign. Their seals like the seals of all other delegates had
                        been previously affixed. With pallid faces and trembling hands they wrote
                        their names quickly and were then conducted back to their places. Their
                        names were at the end of the pages containing the signatures.</p>
                    <p>When the Germans had signed, the pages were turned back to the beginning.
                        Then President Wilson rose and walked down to the right wing table and
                        around the end and proceeded to the table with the treaty upon it. I
                        followed, then Mr. White, Colonel House and General Bliss. In that order we
                        signed opposite our individual seals, the old Lansing coat of arms being
                        finely impressed. The President’s seal was a small one with his name written
                        stenographically. It had been made with a gold ring thus engraved. We then
                        in turn signed the Polish treaty and the Rhine agreement which were on small
                        side-tables.</p>
                    <p>I used, in signing, a plain steel pen in a silver penholder, the latter
                        presented for the occasion by my office. The same penholder and pen I had
                        used this morning at the President’s house to sign the treaty with France by
                        which the United States promises to come to her aid in the event of
                        aggression by Germany. The Treaty was signed by Clemenceau, Pichon, the
                        President and me, and is to be sent to the Senate at the same time as the
                        Treaty of Peace is laid before that body.</p>
                    <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0639"/>
                    <p>When we had signed the Treaty of Peace and returned to our seats by way of
                        the left wing table, the President whispered, “I did not know I was excited
                        until I found my hand trembling when I wrote my name.” I had noticed that
                        his signature was unusually cramped. My own name I wrote without any feeling
                        of nervousness. Possibly I was not as sensitive to the occasion as the
                        President. It is hard to understand why I was not more responsive to the
                        emotional impulses of such a momentous event. I cannot explain it
                        myself.</p>
                    <p>After the American delegation had signed, the delegates of the British Empire
                        followed, then those of France, Italy and Japan and so on down the list in
                        the alphabetical order of the countries. From the time that the Germans
                        affixed their signatures to the document to the end of the signing about
                        forty-five minutes elapsed. It became a monotonous business after the first
                        few had signed, and so the delegates and spectators visited with their
                        neighbors, while the autograph-hunters continued their efforts, clustering
                        about the central group of M. Clemenceau, President Wilson and Mr. Lloyd
                        George. It certainly took from the dignity of the occasion.</p>
                    <p>There was one circumstance which caused a feeling of disquietude and, in a
                        measure, of surprise, and that was the absence from the assembly of the
                        Chinese delegates.</p>
                    <p>In the morning Baron Makino, the head of the Japanese delegation, came to see
                        me at my request. For three quarters of an hour I labored with him
                        endeavoring to persuade him to issue a formal public statement embodying the
                        assurances of Japan to the Council of Four as to the surrender of Shantung
                        to China and the liberal policy Japan intended to pursue. I gave him a draft
                        of a statement and urged him to see the Chinese and, if he was unwilling to
                        issue the statement at once, to tell them that he would issue it after the
                        signing of the treaty. I pointed out to him that such a course would gain
                        general applause and cause satisfaction everywhere and that, if he failed to
                        do it, I believed China would not sign the treaty since the Council of Four
                        had refused to permit them to sign with reservations. I said that, if the
                        Chinese failed to sign, the blame for their failure would fall chiefly upon
                        Japan whatever the justice of the case might be, that it would cause the
                        Shantung articles and Japan’s designs to be the source of serious criticism,
                        and might even endanger the ratification of the treaty in certain countries,
                        while it would undoubtedly arouse bitter resentment in China and might
                        result in forceful resistance to the Japanese throughout the country.</p>
                    <p>Baron Makino listened with great attention and expressed appreciation of my
                        efforts but said that on account of Japanese public opinion he was afraid
                        that the proposed action could not be taken and that he did not believe that
                        the Chinese would refuse to sign the treaty. I repeated that I was sure that
                        he under-estimated the intensity of <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0640"
                        />China’s sense of being unjustly treated and that I was firmly convinced
                        that the Chinese delegates would not sign unless some public statement of
                        policy in the nature of the one which I had given him was issued or at least
                        promised. I asked him again to study the draft and to act for his government
                        in a way to relieve the situation and insure China’s participation. I felt,
                        however, that, while Makino was very courteous and apparently impressed, I
                        had not made a dent in his armor of oriental inscrutability. In a word, I
                        know that I have completely failed in persuading him.</p>
                    <p>Subsequent events proved the correctness of my assertion so far as the
                        signature of the treaty by China was concerned, and I believe that the
                        consequences will be like those prophesied unless Japan changes the course
                        taken by her delegates and gives out a statement. Even then it may be too
                        late to remove the impression already made.</p>
                    <p>The President was greatly disturbed at the absence of the Chinese. When I
                        pointed it out to him, he exclaimed, “That is most serious. It will cause
                        grave complications.” I told him of my interview with Makino and he said
                        that he was sorry that they had not listened to me, as he believed trouble
                        would result. He then added “this is most unfortunate, but I don’t know what
                        we can do”.</p>
                    <p>It was also a subject of remark that neither President Poincaré nor Marshal
                        Foch was present. The impression seemed to be general that Poincaré was not
                        there because Clemenceau did not want him, as the report is that there is
                        little love lost between them. I believe, however, that the reason was that
                        it would have caused embarrassment to find him a seat in conformity with his
                        official dignity. Of course he could not preside and yet as head of the
                        French Republic he could not have taken a position below the French Premier.
                        This seems to me the most plausible explanation of his absence, though the
                        former may have had some influence.</p>
                    <p>I do not know what excuse will be offered for Foch’s not being present.
                        Probably the call of duty will be given, a convenient but inconclusive
                        reason, though possibly the true one. My own belief is that he purposely
                        absented himself to show that he did not approve the treaty. At the plenary
                        session of the Conference preceding the delivery of the treaty to the
                        Germans on May 7th, he made an address<note n="58" xml:id="d272fn58"><ref

                        declaring that the treaty ought not to be signed as it was not severe enough
                        on Germany and failed to protect France from future aggression. Having taken
                        this radical position, to which little or no attention was paid by anybody,
                        he would have been in rather a humiliating position if he had sanctioned by
                        his presence the celebration of a treaty to which he had so unequivocally
                        objected. His absence, however, caused general remark, astonishment and
                        regret.</p>
                    <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0641"/>
                    <p>After the signature and after M. Clemenceau’s announcement that the session
                        was ended, the German delegates were formally conducted out of the Hall.
                        When they had gone, the other delegates without ceremony left their seats,
                        some going to the windows to look at the famous fountains and the crowds
                        swarming on the terraces, others chatting with the spectators, examining the
                        signed treaty or making their way to the exit. Even before the last delegate
                        had signed the cannon had begun to boom out the news while the whirring of
                        aeroplanes over the palace and gardens was clearly audible.</p>
                    <p>One of the striking features of the ceremony was the presence of twenty
                        poilus and twenty doughboys in the embrasures of the windows facing the long
                        table. The French soldiers were hideously disfigured by face wounds, some
                        appearing to have on the grotesque masks of Greek comedy and tragedy. The
                        American boys were from different units and selected under General
                        Pershing’s direction.</p>
                    <p>M. Clemenceau accompanied by President Wilson and Mr. Lloyd George proceeded
                        to the Terrace, where immense throngs crowded about them cheering as they
                        walked slowly between the playing fountains. Mrs. Wilson, Mrs. Lansing,
                        Ambassador and Mrs. Wallace and I stood in one of the balconied windows of
                        the Galerie des Glaces and watched the scene which was most inspiring, a
                        wonderful demonstration of popular joy.</p>
                    <p>We then went down to the grand entrance and found our car after some little
                        delay, and, foregoing tea with M. Clemenceau, we were soon on our way to
                        Paris along roads black with people who waved flags and cheered as we
                        passed. It was surprising how many American flags were in evidence.</p>
                    <p>Tonight Paris is a seething mass of rejoicing people. They are dancing,
                        shouting, carrying flags of various nationalities and dragging about the
                        streets captured German guns which have adorned the Place de la Concorde and
                        Champs Élysées. Great army trucks, French, American and British, pass along
                        simply hidden with men in uniform, and the cocottes are reaping a rich
                        harvest of soldiers’ caps as souvenirs. The scene is one hard to describe.
                        Paris seems delirious.</p>
                    <p>We were dining this evening with the Paderewskis at the Hotel Ritz, but I had
                        to leave at 9:15 to go to the Gare des Invalides to see the President and
                        his party start for Brest. It was no easy matter to drive a motor car
                        through the revellers who filled the roadway. Crowds were about the station
                        and the President received a great ovation as he entered the decorated way
                        to his train.</p>
                    <p>I saw M. Clemenceau at the station and said to him, “This is your day, Mr.
                        President.” “And yours, yes, yours too,” he answered, his face beaming. “It
                        is not the same”, I said, “You are the great figure”. He smiled even more
                        broadly and shook my hand warmly as we parted.</p>
                    <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604" facs="0642"/>
                    <p>The revelry is continuing as I write. It is after one o’clock now, and songs,
                        cheers, and horns are making a joyous din, while the streets and the great
                        square still are filled with men and women. Paris does not intend to sleep
                        tonight. So ends this great day.</p>

                        <p>My Fellow Countrymen: The treaty of peace has been signed. If it is
                            ratified and acted upon in full and sincere execution of its terms it
                            will furnish the charter for a new order of affairs in the world. It is
                            a severe treaty in the duties and penalties it imposes upon Germany, but
                            it is severe only because great wrongs done by Germany are to be righted
                            and repaired; it imposes nothing that Germany can not do; and she can
                            regain her rightful standing in the world by the prompt and honorable
                            fulfillment of its terms. And it is much more than a treaty of peace
                            with Germany. It liberates great peoples who have never before been able
                            to find the way to liberty. It ends, once for all, an old and
                            intolerable order under which small groups of selfish men could use the
                            peoples of great empires to serve their own ambition for power and
                            dominion. It associates the free governments of the world in a permanent
                            league in which they are pledged to use their united power to maintain
                            peace by maintaining right and justice. It makes international law a
                            reality supported by imperative sanctions. It does away with the right
                            of conquest and rejects the policy of annexation and substitutes a new
                            order under which backward nations—populations which have not yet come
                            to political consciousness and peoples who are ready for independence
                            but not yet quite prepared to dispense with protection and
                            guidance—shall no more be subjected to the domination and exploitation
                            of a stronger nation, but shall be put under the friendly direction and
                            afforded the helpful assistance of governments which undertake to be
                            responsible to the opinion of mankind in the execution of their task by
                            accepting the direction of the league of nations. It recognizes the
                            inalienable rights of nationality; the rights of minorities and the
                            sanctity of religious belief and practice. It lays the basis for
                            conventions which shall free the commercial intercourse of the world
                            from unjust and vexatious restrictions and for every sort of
                            international cooperation that will serve to cleanse the life of the
                            world and facilitate its common action in beneficent service of every
                            kind. It furnishes guarantees such as were never given or even
                            contemplated before for the fair treatment of all who <pb n="605"
                                xml:id="pg_605" facs="0643"/>labor at the daily tasks of the world.
                            It is for this reason that I have spoken of it as a great charter for a
                            new order of affairs. There is ground here for deep satisfaction,
                            universal reassurance, and confident hope.</p>

                    <p>922. Statement by President Wilson upon leaving France.</p>
                    <p>“As I look back over the eventful months I have spent in France, my memory is
                        not of conferences and hard work alone, but also of innumerable acts of
                        generosity and friendship which have made me feel how genuine the sentiments
                        of France are towards the people of America, and how fortunate I have been
                        to be the representative of our people in the midst of a nation which knows
                        how to show its kindness with so much charm and such open manifestation of
                        what is in its heart. Deeply happy as I am at the prospect of joining my own
                        countrymen again, I leave France with genuine regret, my deep sympathy for
                        her people and belief in her future confirmed, my thought enlarged by the
                        privilege of association with her public men, conscious of more than one
                        affectionate friendship formed, and profoundly grateful for unstinted
                        hospitality and for countless kindnesses which have made me feel welcome and
                        at home. I take the liberty of bidding France God-speed as well as good bye,
                        and of expressing once more my abiding interest and entire confidence in her
                        future. Woodrow Wilson.”</p>

                    <p>2894. [From Lansing.] Your 2709 [<hi rend="italic">2381?</hi>] of June 23.
                        The President considers that it is advisable that I return to Washington as
                        soon as machinery can be started to complete work here, which I believe can
                        be done in a few days.</p>
                    <p>I am, therefore, planning to leave on July 10th or soon after that date. You
                        may of course reserve final decision as to taking my place until I arrive in
                        America. I would however earnestly advise your coming in that capacity as I
                        am sure that you would find the change of work a very great relief. I
                        realize the difficulties which you mention but hope that they may be
                        overcome.</p>
                    <p>My opinion is that someone fully representative of the Administration should
                        continue my work here, which now that the German treaty is out of the way
                        and the Austrian treaty about completed, ought not to be arduous.</p>
                    <p>In the event that you are able to come I wish you would consider the
                        possibility of bringing Woolsey<note n="61" xml:id="d275fn61">Lester H.
                            Woolsey, Solicitor for the Department of State.</note> with you. If the
                        Solicitor’s office can be left by him in the hands of a competent head, I am
                        sure that he ought to come with you, not only on your own account but
                        because he will be greatly needed in arranging for the post-war work of the
                        Department, a branch of the work with which you should not be burdened if
                        you can arrange to come. If you think it wise you may confidentially sound
                        Woolsey as to this plan. He would work well with Dr. Scott and Foster Dulles
                        who will remain here.</p>
                    <p>I hope that in the event that my suggestion appeals to you you will plan to
                        leave within a few days after my arrival in America as there should be as
                        little hiatus as possible in the Commission’s head since the work will be
                        hampered during that period. Lansing.</p>

                                congratulations. I hope with all my heart that this first act of the
                                gigantic work, crowning the efforts and sacrifices of millions of
                                men who fought for the cause of justice, will open a new era of good
                                will and prosperity; an era in which will be recognized and
                                maintained the unquestionable right of all nations, great and small,
                                who have suffered so cruelly by the vicissitudes of war, to be
                                equally free and independent, and in which they shall be permitted

                            <p>Roumania has fought for the realization of her long-deferred hope of
                                national unity and the establishment of those rights so often in the
                                past denied to small nations. She has seen her territory overrun,
                                her prosperity destroyed, and her people subjected to untold
                                hardships without pity through relentless foreign occupation. She
                                places her trust in the spirit of fairness of the President and
                                people of the American Republic in these moments of difficulty and
                                danger when she is gallantly striving to maintain her position and
                                perform her full duty as a bulwark of order and civilization in

                        today, I have had a talk with Mr. McNeir and he tells me that he is
                        prepared, subject to the approval of the Commissioners, to take over the
                        responsibility for the organization and business management of the
                        Commission, it being understood that he will have the choice of an Executive
                        Secretary to succeed Mr. Patchin and to work directly with himself. This
                        responsibility, if the proposed plan is adopted by the Commissioners, will
                        cover all of the various branches of the business organization, including
                        hotel management, communications office, index and files, distribution,
                        translation, repair and maintenance, telephones, supplies, post office,
                        transportation, personnel, printing, courier service, photography,
                        headquarters detachment, medical office, and, finally, the disbursing
                        office, of which Mr. McNeir is already in charge.</p>
                    <p>I shall be very glad if the Commissioners will approve of this transfer of
                        responsibility, so that I may have more time to handle diplomatic
                        correspondence and to attend to the affairs of the Commission directly
                        related to the Peace Conference.</p>

                    <p>3053. Reports have reached the Commission that stories are being published in
                        America criticizing a dance recently given in the Hotel Crillon. On the
                        night of July 4th, as a part of the general celebration in Paris, the
                        members of the Staff of the Commission gave an informal dance, the first
                        entertainment of any kind by them since the beginning of the Conference. It
                        was a subscription affair, the expenses of which were borne by the guests
                        themselves, and without any cost whatever to the Government. The story
                        should be denied.</p>

                    <p>3063. For the President [from Lansing]. At the meeting of the Council of Five
                        this afternoon M. Clemenceau stated that he had been requested, by the
                        committee of the Chamber now examining the treaty with Germany, for copies
                        of the printed minutes of the League of Nations Commission and inquired
                        whether his colleagues on the Council had any objection to his furnishing
                        the committee these minutes for their confidential information. I advised
                        against it inasmuch as I believe that it would establish a very dangerous
                        precedent. Copies of certain reports of conference commissions have been
                        made public but none of the minutes of any of the commissions have been
                        given out.</p>
                    <p>At M. Clemenceau’s request I undertook to inquire as to your wishes and will
                        let him know your answer at the earliest moment possible. Meanwhile M.
                        Clemenceau will delay making reply to the request of the committee of the
                        Chamber. Lansing.</p>

                        p.m. think it would be most unwise to supply legislative committee with
                        minutes of Commission on League of Nations or any other Commission. I do not
                        remember any action of the Commission authorizing the printing of its
                        minutes. Please thank Clemenceau for seeking my opinion. (Signed)

                    <p>Many thoughts rush to mind on leaving the Peace Conference after six months
                        of effort. Never before has such an international gathering been held, for
                        here has been the meeting-ground of 27 nations to liquidate a world-war and
                        establish a new order, and a laboratory where already a system of world
                        cooperation has been born out of necessity.</p>
                    <p>Out of it all has come the most important international document ever drawn,
                        the treaty of peace with Germany, a document which not only meets the issues
                        of the present war, but also lays down new agreements of the most helpful
                        and most hopeful character. The nations are bound together to avert another
                        world catastrophe; backward peoples are given a new hope for their future;
                        several racial entities are liberated to form new States; a beginning is
                        made towards removing unjust economic restrictions: and the great military
                        autocracies <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0651"/>of Central Europe are
                        destroyed as the first step in a general disarmament.</p>
                    <p>The treaty is, of course, not all that we had hoped for. It could hardly be
                        expected to be. Too many conflicting interests were involved, as well as too
                        many legitimate doubts which would tax the most perfectly balanced mind.
                        Nearly everyone will find in it weaknesses both of omission and commission,
                        provisions inserted which might better have been left out and provisions
                        left out which might better have been inserted. Such a document must,
                        however, be examined both against the background of its creation and in the
                        large sweep of its spirit. From that point of view we may call it a
                        stepping-stone from the old international methods to the new. If it still
                        holds some of the distrusts and hatreds of the war which Germany has full
                        well earned for herself, if its construction has been hindered by memories
                        of secret pacts and promises, it must be borne in mind that it carries with
                        it the evident purpose to throw off the old methods of international
                        intrigue and plotting.</p>
                    <p>But the present treaties are but the starting-point of world reconstruction.
                        Now that the general principles have been laid down it remains to execute
                        them. And by that I mean, not so much retributive action against nations
                        which have recently run amuck in the world, but rather the cleansing and
                        healing processes that shall really make good our hopes and aspirations.
                        Undoubtedly there is a great danger in the world today. Many people have
                        thought that the mere signing of the treaty with Germany marks the ending of
                        the world peril. Public opinion seems to have breathed a sigh of relief and
                        lapsed back into apathy. Concentration of thought on world problems is
                        weakening now when it is most essential, and the forces of disintegration
                        and reaction have been given a freedom of action far greater than when the
                        world was on its guard.</p>
                    <p>The situation today is serious. Western civilization is still dazed by the
                        shock of four and a half years of destruction. Industry and commerce are not
                        yet restored. All of Europe is impoverished; parts of it are starving. Its
                        whole political fibre has been shot through. Russia and Hungary are gripped
                        by subversive political doctrines; Austria-Hungary and Turkey as empires
                        have ceased to be; Poland and Czecho-Slovakia are struggling to their feet
                        as members of the family of nations. All that complicated machinery of
                        society which it took decades to elaborate and a world war to tear down
                        cannot be replaced overnight by a wholly different machinery.</p>
                    <p>Many problems remain unsettled. Territorial adjustments to secure the rights
                        of peoples to live under their own flag as far as possible in the tangled
                        skein of European nationalities must still be made effective. Attainment of
                        the Polish frontiers on all sides, particularly in East Prussia, is very
                        difficult. The Teschen coal fields are still <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614"
                            facs="0652"/>a source of contention between Poland and Czecho-Slovakia;
                        Hungary is interrupting the trade of all Central Europe; the Adriatic
                        problem is still unsolved, as well as the fate of those large territories
                        formerly under the Turk, including especially Asia Minor and Armenia.</p>
                    <p>World statesmanship will be sorely tried in the next few years. Two things
                        are essential, first an alert, intelligent, interested public opinion, and
                        second cooperation of the nations. The former is needed both as a check on
                        any sinister purposes that may crop up and as the great support for common
                        action. The second is essential unless the nations are to return to a
                        selfish particularism which can only breed the most dangerous disputes. The
                        Peace Conference has been history’s greatest instance of a unified world
                        statesmanship directing the moral and material resources of the world’s
                        family of nations; to allow the spirit behind it to disintegrate at this
                        moment of emergency when united action is imperative, would be fatal to all
                        the hopes of permanent peace with which we entered the war. If it is true
                        that one nation can destroy the equilibrium of all, it is all the more true
                        that each nation is bound by its own law of self-preservation to cooperate
                        with the others to check troubles before they gather headway.</p>
                    <p>So I leave for home tonight, pleased but not over-complacent with the outcome
                        of the past six months, and hopeful but not in the least unmindful of the
                        problems of the next few years.</p>

                        <p>May I, through the French press, bid an affectionate farewell to France
                            and the French people and express my deep gratitude for all the
                            courtesies they have shown me during the months I have been here? I
                            return home with a deep sense of what France has suffered in the war,
                            but with a still deeper conviction that the courage which brought her
                            through to victory will carry her over the trying days of
                            reconstruction.</p>
                        <p>I think that I should say that a delay in the sailing of my steamer has
                            brought my departure to the eve of that day so historic to France, and
                            which now is doubly consecrated by the first Victory Parade of the
                            Allied and Associated Powers.</p>
                        <p>The temptation to remain is great, but imperative necessity prevents my
                            doing so. The demands of peace, including the ratification of the treaty
                            and the Franco-American agreement and the expansion of the work of
                            America’s Department of Foreign Affairs to meet the new problems
                            involved, are no less stern than those of war, and I am sure that the
                            French people, to whom I am deeply indebted, will appreciate better than
                            many others the call of duty.</p>

                    <p>3283. The Paris and New York offices of the Committee on Public Information
                        have continued since June 30 by authorization of the American Commission to
                        furnish a news and editorial service from America by radio. Such parts as
                        are not confidential have been released to the English language newspapers
                        of Paris, and also translated and delivered to the French press. The Paris
                        office has transmitted the official statements and communiqués of the Peace
                        Conference and the Commission to the New York Office for delivery to the
                        three American press associations. In addition there is transmitted daily by
                        radio from the Paris office an average of 6,000 words for the American press
                        associations and newspapers, affording a definite relief from the cable
                        congestion. In this way the transmission machinery hitherto most effective
                        has been kept intact by the Commission at the very moderate cost of $300 a
                        week for the New York office <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0656"/>and
                        about $210 a week for the Paris office. The Commission’s authorization
                        covering the operations of these two offices was effective to July 15, and
                        further authority for this service is now necessary from that date and for a
                        continuance to such time as the Commission’s work in Paris may be concluded.
                        Mr. Walter S. Rogers, who so effectively organized the radio and cable press
                        service, is now in Washington and could furnish you directly any further
                        information you may need on this matter. Commission hopes that Department
                        will find it possible to furnish the funds necessary for this purpose.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Subject: Interchange of Wireless Service Between France and
                        the United States.</p>
                    <p>When the United States entered the war an arrangement was made between the
                        United States and France for an interchange of wireless service. This
                        included the transmission of news reports from the United States to Paris
                        through the Committee on Public Information.</p>
                    <p>After it had been decided that the Peace Conference was to be held in Paris a
                        continuance of the wireless arrangement was negotiated personally between
                        Colonel House and Premier Clemenceau: This continuance was for the duration
                        of the Conference.</p>
                    <p>This made possible the continuance of the wireless news reports from America
                        for release to the English Language newspapers of Paris, as well as the
                        French press. In addition a large amount of editorial comment and many
                        special reports were transmitted from the United States to the American
                        Commission to Negotiate Peace. There was transmitted back to America all the
                        official communiqués and statements of the Peace Conference, announcements
                        of the American Commission, and President Wilson’s addresses. In addition
                        this <pb n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0658"/>wireless arrangement greatly
                        facilitated the frequent world-wide broadcasting of presidential and
                        Conference announcements.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the crowded condition of the cables the service was broadened to
                        include a daily transmission to the United States of 3,000 words for the
                        three American Press Associations, and an additional 3,000 words for the
                        leading American newspapers.</p>
                    <p>Still another development was the adding of a 400 word American news service
                        daily to central Europe, sent from the wireless station located on Eiffel
                        Tower.</p>
                    <p>This whole wireless arrangement has been of great value to the Government and
                        to our people during the Peace Conference, especially in view of the
                        terribly congested condition of the cables.</p>
                    <p>I have just had a letter from Colonel Cartier, head of the French Radio
                        system, suggesting that the interchange of wireless service between the
                        United States and France being a wartime arrangement, now that Peace has
                        been signed with Germany, a new arrangement should be made.</p>
                    <p>In view of the many important matters before the Peace Conference yet,
                        including treaties to be concluded with Austria, Bulgaria, and Turkey, it
                        would be very unfortunate to have the wireless service in any way curtailed
                        until at least the bulk of the more important matters are settled.</p>
                    <p>I believe if Commissioner White recalled the arrangement to the attention of
                        Premier Clemenceau, it could be continued without interruption. In this way
                        a valuable line of communication is constantly available, one that has
                        already proved to be an avenue for goodwill between the two countries.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Governor</hi>: Almost as soon as I arrived in
                        England I sensed an antagonism to the United States. The English are quite
                        as cordial and hospitable to the individual American as ever, but they
                        dislike us collectively.</p>
                    <p>The war has left but two great powers in the world, where before there were
                        seven. While Russia has collapsed internally, and Germany and Austria have
                        fallen through defeat, France and Japan have gone from first to second rate
                        powers because the United States and Great Britain have become so powerful.
                        While the British Empire vastly exceeds the United States in area and
                        population and while their aggregate wealth is perhaps greater than ours,
                        yet our position is much more favorable. It is because of this that the <pb
                            n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0659"/>relations between the two countries
                        are beginning to assume the same character as that of England and Germany
                        before the war.</p>
                    <p>By her industry and organization Germany was forging ahead as the first power
                        in the world, but she lost everything by her arrogance and lack of
                        statesmanship. Will it be Great Britain or the United States who will next
                        commit this colossal blunder. If we are farsighted we will conduct ourselves
                        so as to merit the friendship of all nations, for it is to me conceivable
                        that there may come a time when we will need it.</p>
                    <p>Our war expenditures gave a spectacular exhibition of our wealth which has
                        excited the envy of the world, and which if we are unwise, may lead to a
                        great coalition against us. It looks now as if it would be necessary for us
                        to supply coal to those who formerly looked to England for this commodity,
                        and if we continue our merchant marine building on the present scale, we
                        will be hitting at two of her most lucrative industries.</p>
                    <p>Labor in Europe is showing a strange disinclination for work, and English
                        labor is lagging behind more and more. This accentuates the widening
                        economic position between us. The advanced liberals are questioning the
                        Government as to the reason for their big navy estimates for next year. The
                        Government’s answer is that when the war was ended Great Britain was going
                        at top speed in naval construction and that it would be a great waste not to
                        finish the ships now on the ways. It was brought out that there would be
                        eighty-four ships of the larger class and some thirty-five destroyers. It
                        was the Government’s intention, so it was said, to use the newer types to
                        replace the older ones now in use. The truth is this new construction is
                        because of us, and for no other reason.</p>
                    <p>Haldane,<note n="76" xml:id="d302fn76">Viscount Haldane, Lord High Chancellor
                            of Great Britain, 1912–1915.</note> Grey<note n="77" xml:id="d302fn77"
                            >Viscount Grey of Fallodon, British Secretary of State for Foreign
                            Affairs, 1905–1916.</note> and I dined together on Sunday. The purpose
                        of the conference was to discuss the Government’s request to Grey to become
                        Ambassador at Washington. Curzon, acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, at
                        Lloyd George’s instance, asked Haldane to use his good offices with Grey,
                        and Haldane, in turn, asked me to help. Haldane told Grey and me that the
                        three matters that the Government had in mind to settle with the United
                        States were, first, the naval building program, second, the Irish question,
                        and third, the League of Nations. Grey said that in no circumstances would
                        he become Ambassador, but he would consider going out on a special mission
                        for the purpose of discussing these questions, provided the Government
                        agreed with him about these. He thought there would be no difficulty in
                        regard to the League of Nations or the naval program, but he was insistent
                        that they should outline their Irish policy and that it should be one with
                        which <pb n="622" xml:id="pg_622" facs="0660"/>he could agree. I suggested
                        that Lloyd George and Curzon be told that it was impossible to discuss an
                        abstract question and that he Grey wanted to know what was their Irish
                        program before even considering the question of accepting their offer. This
                        would place the burden on the Government rather than upon Grey.</p>
                    <p>As to the naval building program, Grey told Haldane that he would write him a
                        memorandum which he could hand to the Government. This memorandum would
                        outline his, Grey’s, views which are as follows:</p>
                    <p>That in no circumstances would Great Britain build against the United States
                        no matter how many keels we laid. However, England would hold herself free
                        to build against any European power in any quantity that seemed to her best.
                        On the other hand, the United States could exercise her own judgment about
                        building without regard to Great Britain as against Japan, and they would
                        consider it a matter of no concern to them.</p>
                    <p>Grey told me in this conversation and in another I had with him some two
                        weeks ago that the British Government’s policy during the time he was in
                        office was to disregard the naval program of the United States. In the first
                        place they thought war between the two nations was inconceivable, and in the
                        second, that in a rivalry it was admitted that the United States could
                        outbuild Great Britain. In discussing this matter further with Grey he
                        admitted that this was the liberal point of view and not the conservative or
                        the one held in naval circles. I predict that when they receive Grey’s
                        memorandum concerning these questions, they will soften in their insistence
                        that he go to Washington.</p>
                    <p>You may be surprised that I am not taking into account the League of Nations
                        as a preventive, not only for trouble with Great Britain but also as a
                        deterrent in naval armaments. I consider the League as the great hope of a
                        peaceful solution of all these vexatious international jealousies, but we
                        must admit that it is a long cry from today to the time when the League
                        shall have proved itself such an instrument as we all hope it may be. The
                        fact that this Government wishes an Ambassador of Grey’s standing to go to
                        America to discuss the question of naval armaments indicates that they do
                        not expect it to be reached through the League of Nations.</p>
                    <p>You will have noticed that the British have been very insistent upon
                        reduction of standing armies but they never protest against naval armaments.
                        One of the necessary things to be done in my opinion is the creation of an
                        international code of laws covering both land and sea. It is your belief
                        that in the next war there will be no neutrals, therefore, there is no
                        necessity for a revision of the laws of the sea. I do not agree with this
                        position. It is quite conceivable that war might come between say France and
                        England in which no other nations would be involved. However, the lack of
                        sea laws would almost inevitably bring us into the conflict. If, on the
                        other hand, <pb n="623" xml:id="pg_623" facs="0661"/>we had a chart which
                        all nations had accepted, then any two belligerents would of necessity have
                        to conform to it or bring the world in arms upon themselves. This question
                        of the freedom of the seas is the one thing above all others that brought us
                        into the war, and yet it is no nearer solution today than it was before
                        Germany collapsed. If there were a Liberal Government here I am sure they
                        would recognize the seriousness of this menace.</p>
                    <p>I do not know that I would advise doing anything more at present than to call
                        attention to the fact that it was your purpose to ask consideration of the
                        question sometime within the near future. In the meantime, there might be a
                        Government here sympathetic to the view that a general international
                        understanding upon this subject should be reached.</p>
                    <p>It is my judgment that we should go ahead as rapidly as possible with the
                        organization of the League of Nations, and at the first meeting of the
                        Assembly bring up the question of a reduction of armaments and seek an
                        agreement. Do you not think also that our people should be warned not to
                        expect complete payment of loans to the Entente? Should they not be asked to
                        consider a large share of these loans as a part of our necessary war
                        expenditures, and should not an adjustment be suggested by us and not by our
                        debtors? If this is done then it would be well to do it with a <hi
                            rend="italic">beau geste</hi>. For instance, I notice we have sold our
                        one billion of war material in France to the French Government for three
                        hundred millions. Would it not have been better to have made this a gift in
                        name as, indeed, it is in fact?</p>
                    <p>The one coalition which might conceivably prove dangerous to us is that of
                        Great Britain and Japan, and yet a large section of our people, notably
                        those of Irish and German descent, would welcome trouble in this direction.
                        On the other hand, we have those that are trying to make difficulties with
                        Japan.</p>
                    <p>If I were you I should take some early occasion to invoke the sober attention
                        of our people to these dangers. The world is in a belligerent mood, and the
                        next ten years will be the most dangerous to its peace. If we can get over
                        this period safely and get the League in satisfactory operation, war may
                        conceivably become almost obsolete. Could you serve mankind better at the
                        moment than to caution all to sit steady in the boat, and do what is
                        possible to bring things back to the normal. At present, the world is a long
                        way from being safe, and another upheaval now may completely wreck
                        civilization.</p>
                    <p>Affectionately yours,</p>

                        <p>P. S. Hoover who has just left, is in one of his most pessimistic moods.
                            He is simply reveling in gloom. He gives Europe but thirty days longer
                            of orderly life—after that it is to be revolution, starvation and chaos.
                            In his opinion the coal situation is the most menacing.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. White</hi>: Mr. Suter, who has been assisting
                        us in our wireless news service, has brought to my attention a letter which
                        he has received from Colonel Cartier, head of the French radio system,
                        suggesting that the interchange of wireless service between the United
                        States and France was a wartime arrangement and now that peace has been
                        signed a new arrangement should be made by which news material would be sent
                        over the regular wires. Mr. Suter feels that in view of the many important
                        matters still before the Peace Conference, it would be very unfortunate to
                        have the wireless service curtailed at present.</p>
                    <p>I remember that Colonel House personally arranged for this service with Mr.
                        Clemenceau last autumn, and it is my impression that Mr. Clemenceau gave
                        Colonel House assurances that this service would be continued for the
                        duration of the Peace Conference—not merely until peace should be signed. If
                        you consider it advisable, I can ascertain from Colonel House exactly what
                        the understanding was, but I believe that if you should find an opportunity
                        to say a personal word to Clemenceau about it he would very likely agree to
                        keep the service running during the period of the Peace Conference.</p>
                    <p>I append Mr. Suter’s statement<note n="78" xml:id="d303fn78"><hi

                        giving all the facts regarding the service, and should be glad to learn
                        whether you feel that you can properly take the matter up personally with
                        Mr. Clemenceau.</p>

                    <p>2678. For Polk. Your 3386, July 29, 10 p.m. Glad to learn of your safe
                        arrival. I was greatly disappointed not to see you but have written you very
                        fully and frankly though in greatest secrecy and explained that the
                        political situation appears very mixed. The Republicans have no definite
                        plan as to the treaty and seem considerably disorganized. They do not know
                        whether to follow Taft, Root, Hughes or Lodge, while Borah, Hiram Johnson,
                        Sterling and Fall seem to be flocking by themselves. The President has been
                        very conciliatory and has undoubtedly smothered a good deal of opposition.
                            <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0663"/>I advised him not to arouse
                        resentment by going on a speaking tour on August 4th. He seemed disposed to
                        go but some of the Democratic senators gave him the same advice so he has
                        postponed his trip which is good thing. He can win more support by talking
                        to individuals here than by speaking to arouse the people. The impression is
                        gaining ground that the opposition is to the President personally and not to
                        the treaty and the public does not like it. I am sure the President is
                        gaining ground every day.</p>

                    <p>I have had an hour with Lodge and he seems to be very friendly to the
                        Department and to favor expanding its activities. I have not seen Porter but
                        shall do so in a day or two.</p>
                    <p>Phillips left last night for a month’s vacation. I shall not leave before
                        September. I am trying to make some arrangement so Long can get away.</p>
                    <p>Affectionate regards to you and Mrs. Polk who I hope will enjoy the life in
                        Paris.</p>

                    <p>2681. Your 3283, July 23rd. Before deciding upon the continuance of the Paris
                        and New York offices of Committee on Public Information beyond August 1st,
                        it is important to know definitely whether the service supplied by them is
                        indispensable to the efficient functioning of the Commission. If not, it
                        should be discontinued in view of necessity for economy. Would it be
                        possible to transmit official communiqués to Department, for distribution to
                        press associations and have someone within the Mission file the radios for
                        transmission by French radio? And would not foregoing, with a slight
                        enlargement of the cable information service now supplied by the Department,
                        meet the requirements of the Mission and serve as a practical substitute for
                        Committee on Public Information?</p>
                    <p>Please telegraph your views immediately, in order that decision may be made.
                        Expenses of New York office to August 1st being charged to your
                        allotment.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I have read your letter to
                        Senator Lodge as Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations,<note n="80"
                            xml:id="d307fn80">For text of the letter as sent, see <ref

                        Covenant.</p>
                    <p>My only criticism is that you indicate that there were memoranda relating to
                        the debates in the Commission on the League of Nations which you cannot
                        deliver to them on account of their being in the hands of your colleagues in
                        Paris. I think that this may result in their saying to you that they wish to
                        have copies of these memoranda and would like you to telegraph for them.</p>
                    <p>My own view is, in regard to the proceedings which took place before the
                        Commissions, that they are all of a confidential nature and would require
                        the assent of all the other nations before you could present them to a
                        Senate Committee. This, as you will recall, is the position we took when Mr.
                        Clemenceau asked whether we would be willing to consent to the submission of
                        the minutes on the League of Nations to the French Senate.<note n="81"
                            xml:id="d307fn81">See <ref target="#pg_611">pp. 611</ref>, <ref
                                target="#pg_612">612</ref>.</note> I fear that putting it solely on
                        the ground of the memoranda not being in your hands will compel you later to
                        refuse on the ground which I have stated.</p>
                    <p>My suggestion is that you state that ground in your letter and in that way
                        prevent a further request.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Polk</hi>: As members of a committee designated
                        by the American newspaper correspondents in Paris who are using the cable
                        and wireless regularly and are especially interested in the activities of
                        the Peace Conference, we wish to call to the attention of the American
                        delegates the necessity, in our opinion, for the continuation throughout the
                        negotiation of all the treaties growing out of the war of the arrangements
                        for the press which obtained while the German Treaty was in process of
                        negotiation.</p>
                    <p>The use of the wireless granted to American newspapers and news associations
                        through the courtesy of the American Government has been of mutual
                        advantage, in our opinion, to the American Government and the American
                        Press, and we trust it will be possible for the Peace Delegation to arrange
                        for the continuation of this service until all the treaties are disposed of.
                        This service has enabled individual papers to carry much more matter than
                        they could have afforded to send by cable and has undoubtedly been an
                        important factor in enlightening public opinion in the United States.</p>
                    <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0667"/>
                    <p>During the German peace negotiations the American correspondents were granted
                        an audience with a member of the delegation both in the morning and in the
                        afternoon. Mr. White saw us in the morning and Col. House in the afternoon.
                        This arrangement enabled morning and afternoon newspapers to vary their
                        service. Will it not be possible for you to see us daily at 6 p.m. and for
                        Mr. White to see us at 10.30 a.m.? Such appointments would enable us to
                        check up matter appearing in the foreign press and to keep the American view
                        before the public at home.</p>
                    <p>Twelve of the representative newspapers of New York, Brooklyn, Chicago and
                        Philadelphia, as well as the four more important news services of the United
                        States, have correspondents who are covering the Conference daily. In
                        addition many American magazines, weeklies and feature services have writers
                        in Paris who are dependent upon frequent conferences for their information
                        concerning the progress of the treaty negotiations. All of these
                        correspondents will be deeply grateful for any assistance you and the other
                        members of the American delegation may be able to give us which will make it
                        possible to serve the American public more efficiently.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Chairman</hi>: I have at last been able
                            to go personally over the great mass of papers which remained in my
                            hands at the close of my stay in Paris, and am disappointed to find that
                            it is in no respect a complete file, the complete files remaining with
                            the American Commission.</p>
                        <p>You ask for all drafts or forms presented to or considered by the Peace

                            presented by the American Commissioners, and this I take pleasure in
                            enclosing, along with the formal Report of the Commission on the League

                            transcript of the stenographic reports of the Peace Commission relating
                            to or concerning a League of Nations or the League of Nations <pb

                            bearing upon or used in connection with the Treaty of Peace with Germany
                            now pending. No stenographic reports were taken of the debates on the
                            League of Nations, and such memoranda as were taken it was agreed should
                            be confidential. The reason for regarding as confidential intimate
                            exchanges of opinion with regard to many delicate matters will, of
                            course, occur to you, and I beg to say that I am following the example
                            of the representatives of the other Governments in making this
                            explanation.</p>
                        <p>The various data bearing upon or used in connection with the Treaty of
                            Peace with Germany are so miscellaneous and enormous in mass that it
                            would be impossible for me to supply them without bringing from Paris
                            the whole file of papers of the Commission itself, and would include
                            many memoranda which, it was agreed on grounds of public policy, it
                            would be unwise to make use of outside the Conference.</p>

                    <p>For some weeks Grey has had under consideration an urgent request from this
                        Government to become Ambassador to the United States, in order to bring
                        about an understanding regarding the League of Nations, the naval building
                        program and the Irish question. He declined to consider an Ambassadorship,
                        but has been willing to discuss the possibility of going as a special envoy.
                        His condition was that he might discuss the matter with me and determine
                        what policies regarding the three subjects mentioned would be essential to a
                        successful mission.</p>
                    <p>Grey, Haldane and I have had several conferences and came to these
                        conclusions.</p>

                            It was conceded that the United States could outbuild Great Britain in a
                            contest of this sort. Great Britain was to be free to build whatever she
                            thought necessary for her protection against any European power.</item>

                    <p>The Prime Minister, after consultation with Bonar Law, accepted this program
                        with two reservations.</p>

                        <item>The right of Ireland to impose customs would have to be examined in
                            order to determine whether such a plan would be practicable.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Haldane and I advised Grey to accept provided the conditions outlined are
                        handed Grey in the form of instructions and are not left as a verbal
                        understanding.</p>
                    <p>An announcement may be made immediately. If Grey goes under these conditions
                        the most vexatious subject between the two countries will be in a fair way
                        for settlement. The Prime Minister insists that this shall be entirely
                        confidential until publication.</p>

                    <p>3604. Your 2681 July 31, 3 p.m. Representatives of American newspapers here
                        urge that arrangements be made for the continuation of the radio service
                        until all the treaties are disposed of. French Government now allows them
                        3,000 words per day.</p>
                    <p>In view of the foregoing, would it be possible for this service to be handled
                        by Mr. Emery and the messages sent direct to the Department so as to allow
                        the discontinuance of the New York office? Also in order to maintain the
                        exchange by radio, would it be possible for Mr. Emery to send us enlarged
                        daily news telegram by radio? This American news could then be distributed
                        to the French press as heretofore.</p>
                    <p>Suter is returning early next week. He should arrive by the 20th and will
                        proceed to Washington to explain mechanics of the situation to Emery.</p>
                    <p>Under the circumstances and if you approve, it would seem desirable to
                        continue the New York office until after Suter’s arrival, giving the staff
                        now notice that the office would be closed on the 31st. After Suter’s
                        departure the office here will cost about $120 per week.</p>
                    <p>Please pay expenses of New York office to date, charging to our
                        allotment.</p>

                        regarding the interchange of wireless service between the United States and

                        continue to use this service as heretofore. Therefore, Mr. White suggests
                        that, if you consider it necessary that any further arrangements should be
                        made, this message be communicated to Colonel Cartier, suggesting that he

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Governor</hi>: I am enclosing you a copy of a cable
                        which I sent you on the 9th.<note n="86" xml:id="d312fn86">Not enclosed with
                            file copy of this letter.</note></p>
                    <p>Haldane telephoned this morning and asked me to come to London to lunch at
                        the Prime Minister’s with Grey and himself. I had a chill day before
                        yesterday and was not quite equal to the trip but Grey is coming down here
                        this afternoon. Before I close this letter I will let you know the final
                        outcome and will also send you a cable tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>I am very happy at the turn things have taken. It is not only that Grey’s
                        going has brought George and his Ministers to terms regarding the essential
                        questions between our two countries, but since I last wrote you the
                        Government have been hammered mercilessly by the Liberals.</p>
                    <p>A week or ten days ago a dinner was given me at the Reform Club to meet most
                        of the representative liberal writers in England. I am enclosing you an
                        extract from a letter which I have just received from Sir George Paish
                        giving the result of the conference.<note n="87" xml:id="d312fn87">This
                            extract does not accompany the file copy of Colonel House’s
                            letter.</note> I gave these men sufficient information to guide them in
                        their editorial work, <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0671"/>and I am
                        already beginning to see the result. The atmosphere has cleared considerably
                        and with Grey in Washington with you I have no doubt but that everything
                        will come right.</p>
                    <p>It is my intention to sail for home around the middle of September. There is
                        no need of remaining longer than that. If Mandate A is to be finished before
                        the Turkish Treaty is formed as we desire, there will be ample time to
                        accomplish it before then. If the Council of the League of Nations should
                        sit before our Senate ratifies the Treaty, it would not do for me to sit
                        with them although it has been intimated that as a matter of courtesy they
                        would like a representative of the United States to be present.</p>
                    <p>We are having a difference of opinion in regard to the time of the meeting of
                        the Assembly. I am urging that it sit in Washington just as soon as the
                        Treaty is ratified by the Senate and enough of the other powers to put it
                        into force. Cecil and Drummond take a contrary view. They do not want it to
                        be called until early next year or in the Spring. I consider this would be a
                        great mistake, and every liberal in England with whom I have talked have
                            [<hi rend="italic">has</hi>] expressed an agreement with me. This
                        includes Grey and Haldane and the liberal group of editors whom I met at the
                        Reform Club. To delay the meeting of the Assembly as long as Cecil and
                        Drummond desire would be to disappoint the world and make it feel that the
                        League was to be another Hague Conference fiasco.</p>
                    <p>Cecil’s argument is that there ought not to be a meeting until an agenda of
                        sufficient importance is worked out to make it impressive. My contention is
                        that an agenda can be formulated within an hour and then committees can be
                        appointed at the Washington meeting to report if necessary at the next
                        meeting of the Assembly which could be held in Geneva in the early winter or
                        spring. The world would then have an assurance of the things that were in
                        contemplation and under way. Happily, the matter is in your hands and the
                        meeting can be called when in your judgment it seems best to do so.</p>
                    <p>My principal activities with the League now are to delay action and thus far
                        I have been successful.</p>
                    <p>Affectionately yours,</p>

                        what you have already done to bring our two countries closer together.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Colonel</hi>: I cannot tell you how glad I was
                        to see that the British had decided to send Lord Grey over. I am sure he and
                        the President will get on and with the assistance of Tyrrell a lot of hard
                        spots will be smoothed out. I am sure you had a good deal to do with this
                        arrangement.</p>
                    <p>We are drifting along here in rather an unsatisfactory way owing to the fact
                        that I am having some difficulty in getting my instructions from Washington.
                        We almost made a compromise on the Thracian situation after a hard fight
                        against the whole “bunch” and were then told by Washington that they would
                        not listen to any compromise whatever, but wanted East and West Thrace in an
                        International State. That of course is out of the question, for as long as
                        it is not known who is to have the mandate for Constantinople neither the
                        British nor French would be willing to run the chance of the other getting
                        all the territory along the Aegean. I have telegraphed again to Washington
                        and am waiting anxiously to see whether I am going to get “spanked” or
                        whether we can close up the Bulgarian treaty. This really is the only
                        serious question I have left.</p>
                    <p>My information in regard to the Treaty prospects is rather mixed. My
                        observation was when I left home that the situation was in the middle. It is
                        not as bad as the republicans would make it out and it is not as good as the
                        President is being told by some of his advisers. Personally, I think they
                        will have to come to definitions and I don’t think that would be
                        particularly objectionable. I know <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0673"
                        />the French won’t fight it. I rather look for the Committee to report in
                        the next ten days and the Senate ought to pretty thoroughly talk itself to
                        death in three weeks.</p>
                    <p>I hope to get over to London as soon as the Austrian Treaty is signed—that
                        should be within the next ten days. Balfour wishes to shut up shop and leave
                        then as the Bulgarians will take some time to consider their treaty and we
                        cannot treat with the Hungarians until they have a government. Hugh Wallace
                        is going to make a speech September 6th at Bordeaux and I have been asked to
                        go down, but I think that I will let them dedicate the monument without my
                        presence.</p>
                    <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>Looking forward to seeing you and with warmest regards to the family, I
                        am</p>
                    <p>Yours faithfully,</p>

                        <p>P. S. I wish you would impress on the British how dangerous the Roumanian
                            situation is. If we permit these little fellows to defy us they will all
                            get the habit and Germany will catch the disease. Our people in Central
                            Europe think that Colonel Cunningham had something to do with the
                            Hapsburg Duke being in the foreground. That is a marvelously stupid
                            thing for them to permit. If the Hungarians want a Hapsburg let them
                            wait until they can vote for one.</p>

                        <p>P. S. Our annual falling out seems to have occurred. The Foreign Office
                            received a cable the other day saying that we were no longer on good
                            terms and asking that the Prime Minister and Balfour be informed. The
                            press representatives also told me that they had the same news. I am
                            wondering where this particular story originated and why they wanted the
                            Prime Minister and Balfour to be informed. Tyrrell said it came from one
                            of their men in New York and not from Washington.</p>

                    <p>5882. For Colonel House’s information. Your telegram concerning Grey did not
                        reach us until your letter enclosing a copy of it was handed to me.<note
                            n="89" xml:id="d316fn89">See Colonel House’s letter of August 11 to
                            President Wilson, <ref target="#pg_632">p. 632</ref>.</note> If Grey
                        arrives with satisfactory powers on the questions you refer to, the greatest
                        service would be rendered to the two countries. In any case, Grey will be
                        heartily welcomed although the fact that Great Britain continues to send us
                        special envoys instead of a permanent Ambassador is causing a great deal of
                        unfavorable comment on this side. We should all be glad if Grey were able to
                        remain.</p>
                    <p>I beg you to reconsider your plans. You will make a grave mistake by coming
                        back before the Senate ratifies the Treaty. It would undoubtedly be
                        construed as a breaking up of the American Mission and it would supply great
                        capital. I hoped that you could return to Paris and participate in the work
                        carried on there. You should, in any case, be in reach to cooperate with the
                        Mission in every possible way. The situation here makes this vitally
                        important. I expect that by the early part of October the treaty will be
                        ratified.</p>
                    <p>Please acknowledge receipt of note from the President.</p>

                    <p>2934. For the President [from House]: Today’s papers carry news that you will
                        definitely tour the States. My best wishes go with you. I believe that the
                        people throughout the country are tired of the technical controversies into
                        which discussion has lately been drawn in Washington and will welcome a
                        reassertion of the ideals America fought for and the broad principles upon
                        which the League is based. There is a noticeable sag in popular interest in
                        Europe as well as in America and your voice is eagerly awaited.</p>
                    <p>The world needs to be reminded of the way in which the League will serve to
                        avoid war through discussion, delay and publicity; it needs to be assured
                        that some program of world disarmament is really contemplated which will
                        contribute to remedy the cost of living; it needs to be shown the closely
                        interwoven economic relations between countries which make international
                        cooperation not only a moral choice but a shelter and even a selfish
                        necessity.</p>
                    <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0676"/>
                    <p>From this distance it seems to me that hostility to the League in America is
                        almost wholly based upon article 10. You will best know after your tour is
                        over whether or not the American people show response to the argument that
                        we are for the first time making order out of anarchy in international
                        relations and are laying down the principle that territory is no longer to
                        be acquired by force of arms. It would seem that our people have not yet
                        grasped the limitations and significance of the external aggression clause.
                        I cannot help feeling that you will find response to the argument that we
                        are now taking in international relations the first primitive step which the
                        state took in requiring its citizens to go to law for the vindication of
                        their claims. Edward House.</p>

                        this morning insisting that I remain in Europe for the present, and
                        expressing the hope that I might return to Paris soon.<note n="90"

                            Britain, <ref target="#pg_636">p. 636</ref>.</note> He is so urgent that
                        it leaves me no choice but to comply.</p>
                    <p>The final sittings of the Mandate Commission are to be on September 9th and
                        10th provided, indeed, they are held at all in view of the French attitude.
                        Unless there is some change of plans we shall probably reach Paris on
                        September 13th. I sincerely hope that I shall not have to remain longer than
                        October 1st.</p>
                    <p>Our party will consist besides Mrs. House and myself of Miss Denton, Berry
                        (Naval Yeoman) and perhaps Col. Bonsai. I would appreciate it if you would
                        get us the best available rooms. Those formerly occupied by General Bliss
                        would do if they can be had. However, I shall leave this to you.</p>
                    <p>In view of this change of front I would appreciate it if you would telegraph
                        me or write what kind of statement you think should be given out upon my
                        arrival in Paris or before I leave London. This is important. What I have in
                        mind to say is that I am returning to Paris to advise with the Commission in
                        regard to unfinished matters of the Peace Conference.</p>
                    <p>Please inform General Bliss and Mr. White, and all of you please keep the

                    <p>3019. [For Polk.] Your 4002 of September 2, 3 p.m. The reason the President
                        has asked House to return to Paris is that Colonel House had planned to come
                        to the United States shortly after September 1st and the President thought
                        his return while negotiations were still proceeding at Paris would cause
                        criticism. I am of the impression that the President does not wish to have
                        the Colonel here while the treaty is being considered by the Senate because
                        he would certainly be summoned before the Committee, which might be
                        embarrassing.</p>
                    <p>Of course, you will remain at the head of the American delegation as House is
                        below Henry White in rank. In my opinion, you should assert your position
                        and keep control of affairs.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Governor</hi>: After receiving your cable<note
                            n="93" xml:id="d327fn93">No. 5882, August 28, 1919, to the Ambassador in
                            Great Britain, <ref target="#pg_636">p. 636</ref>.</note> I notified
                        Lord Grey that I would not be able to return with him to the United States
                        on September 20th, as I had promised. He seems a little timid about the
                        whole adventure and I hope you will give him the warmest possible welcome.
                        He is one of the finest characters I have ever met and you will find him the
                        most satisfactory man representing a foreign government with whom you have
                        had to deal. He would like to meet you in a personal way first before
                        discussing business, and if <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0679"/>you
                        could have him around some evening alone I think it would be a joy to you
                        both.</p>
                    <p>I had a talk with Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer, yesterday. He
                        believes that England can pull through and finally pay all her obligations
                        provided she gets a little helpful consideration from the United States. It
                        is not merely money that they want but at the moment they would like the
                        interest payments deferred, and they would like the use of the American
                        dollars which will come to them in one way or another during the next few
                        months.</p>
                    <p>I am counting upon going over to Paris on the 13th. It is my intention to be
                        there in an advisory capacity and not to sit in negotiations that are now
                        pending. I shall try to get things so organized as to shorten their labors
                        and bring them to an early conclusion. There is an enormous amount of
                        criticism here and I suppose everywhere because of the delay.</p>
                    <p>The Hungarian, Bulgarian and Austrian Treaties should be out of the way by
                        the first of the month, and it seems by common consent the Turkish Treaty is
                        to be deferred.</p>
                    <p>I shall count upon sailing for the United States the 10th of October. This
                        would bring me there after the Treaty is out of the way.</p>
                    <p>Affectionately yours,</p>

                    <p>2634. For Polk from House.</p>
                    <p>“In answer to your number 2241 about a week ago I received the following from
                        Lansing.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>‘By direction of the President the Department has today announced to the
                            press that the report of your return to the United States is not true.
                            But that when you complete your conferences in England in regard to the
                            organization and work of the League of Nations, you will go to Paris to
                            resume your duties as Peace Commissioner.’</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>In view of this do you think it necessary to give out any further statement?
                        Before leaving here I thought I might say,</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>‘The President has asked me to return to Paris as soon as I have finished
                            sitting on the Commission for mandates. I do not know how long it will
                            be necessary for me to remain in Paris but I shall probably not return
                            to England.’</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>Will you not give me your opinion? I expect to leave here Saturday morning
                        but will not reach Paris before Sunday evening. Are you coming here this

                    <p>4126. Confidential for the Secretary of State from Polk.</p>
                    <p>Last week Balfour announced that as soon as the Austrian Treaty was signed
                        and the Bulgarian Treaty delivered he would leave and as he saw no necessity
                        for the Council continuing to sit no one would come to take his place.
                        Clemenceau objected strenuously. I told Balfour and Philip Kerr, Lloyd
                        George’s Secretary, that while I thought the Council was mixing up with a
                        good many things that really belonged to the foreign offices, yet an
                        adjournment at this time would be entirely misconstrued, as the Roumanian
                        question is unsettled and the Silesian question and a number of other
                        matters that could not be left up in the air. I pointed out the impression
                        on Roumania and Hungary would be extremely bad. Balfour was firm as he is
                        thoroughly tired out. He leaves Thursday but Philip Kerr has persuaded Lloyd
                        George to come here the end of this week and <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643"
                            facs="0681"/>he will sit through next week. If these matters are not
                        cleared up then I think he will send Bonar Law or Curzon.</p>
                    <p>I feel, however, that it is a mistake to continue to sit in the Quai D’Orsay,
                        as we are surrounded by a number of the permanent French Foreign Office
                        officials and they are able to create an impression in the minds of the
                        small powers frequently not in line with the views expressed by the
                        delegates. If we continue to sit I will take this up. Will cable you again
                        on this subject after I see Lloyd George on Friday. Polk.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Governor</hi>: I arrived here yesterday. The Peace
                        Conference is practically a thing of the past. We have four Commissioners
                        now here and the British have none other than Milner who will remain for
                        only a short while. My judgment is that the sooner the Conference is wound
                        up the better it will be for the situation at home. I notice that the
                        republican senators say that the Conference will be in session for another
                        six months and that the Treaty can easily be amended.</p>
                    <p>If the Conference adjourns leaving someone to sign the Bulgarian and
                        Hungarian Treaties it would be the best solution. The Turkish Treaty will
                        have to be taken up separately and at some more distant date.</p>
                    <p>Lloyd George wanted the Conference to adjourn immediately but Clemenceau and
                        Polk disagreed with him. Polk thinks that within ten days it ought to
                        adjourn temporarily until the Bulgarian and Hungarian Treaties are ready for
                        signature. I strongly advise, therefore, that you give direction to bring
                        matters to as speedy a conclusion as the situation admits.</p>
                    <p>There is nothing in life I would dislike more than being called before the
                        Senate Committee. I have never had any experience in such matters. However,
                        I am convinced that it would serve the cause well if I could be there and
                        tell a different story from any that I have read as having been told. I
                        could certainly put your position and your attitude while in Paris in a
                        better light. I feel somehow that you have been crucified by your friends,
                        perhaps not consciously but nevertheless it is a fact.</p>
                    <p>I am counting now on sailing October 8th unless you indicate a wish that I
                        come sooner. I follow you from day to day and my heart was never so
                        responsive to your efforts in behalf of mankind.</p>
                    <p>Affectionately yours,</p>

                    <p>4216. Confidential for the President and Secretary of State [from Polk].
                        Lloyd George told me Friday night in the course of general discussion that
                        he wanted to clear up everything immediately that could be cleared up and
                        adjourn the Conference. He said he <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0683"
                        />was leaving town Monday night, that no cabinet officer was willing to stay
                        here and therefore he expected to do what could be done on Monday and then
                        adjourn. He said that the Italian question should be settled and he was in
                        favor of letting the Italians have Fiume. As to Fiume I told him that as he
                        knew a compromise had been submitted to President Wilson and pending an
                        answer from him I did not see that any discussion could be of any use but
                        that as he was aware the United States Government could not consent to any
                        such arrangement named in connection with the adjournment of the Conference.
                        I saw him on Saturday afternoon and told him that while I agreed with him
                        that the Conference should be hurried up he must remember the delay was not
                        our fault and that there were many matters pending which must be settled, in
                        my opinion, before an adjournment could be taken. I specified particularly
                        the Roumanian, Galician and other pending matters. I told him that it was
                        necessary to deliver the Bulgarian treaty and to complete the Hungarian
                        treaty and that some organization should be kept here for the purpose of
                        watching the Hungarian and Roumanian situation, that these might be cleaned
                        up this week but that in any event I did not think the British Government
                        had the right to issue an ultimatum and close the Conference when we were
                        ready and willing to dispose [of] the subjects still pending. He finally
                        said that he agreed with me and promised to have someone stay here after he
                        left and suggested Sir Eyre Crowe. I told him that in my opinion he should
                        have one of the regular plenipotentiaries or a cabinet officer, that the
                        appearance of the British withdrawing at this time would be extremely bad.
                        He said he would try to see what he could do to persuade Milner or Bonar Law
                        to stay here for this week.</p>
                    <p>I will report further after our conference this morning. Polk.</p>

                            replied by letter on the 18th<note n="97" xml:id="d335fn97">Not found in
                                Department files.</note> without any comment on his reasons. Bullitt
                            on the 19th asked to see me to say good-bye and I saw him. He elaborated
                            on the reasons for his resignation and said that he could not
                            conscientiously give countenance to a treaty which was based on
                            injustice. I told him that I <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646" facs="0684"
                            />would say nothing against his resigning since he put it on
                            conscientious grounds, and that I recognized that certain features of
                            the Treaty were bad, as I presumed most every one did, but that was
                            probably unavoidable in view of conflicting claims and that nothing
                            ought to be done to prevent the speedy restoration of peace by signing
                            the Treaty. Bullitt then discussed the numerous European commissions
                            provided for by the Treaty on which the United States was to be
                            represented. I told him that I was disturbed by this fact because I was
                            afraid the Senate and possibly the people, if they understood this,
                            would refuse ratification, and that anything which was an obstacle to
                            ratification was unfortunate because we ought to have peace as soon as
                            possible.</p>

                    <p>4244. Confidential. For the President and Secretary of State [from Polk]. As
                        stated in my 4216, September 15, 3 p.m., Lloyd George told me at dinner
                        Friday night that he thought the Conference should be dissolved. I pointed
                        out to him then and also in our interview on Saturday that it is out of the
                        question to dissolve until the Bulgarian and Hungarian treaties are disposed
                        of. I also mentioned Galicia, the Adriatic, Greek and Roumanian minority
                        treaties, eastern frontier of Poland, Dobruja, Silesia and the Roumanian
                        question as matters that would have to receive attention before we could
                        talk of adjourning. I pointed out that the dissolution of the Council would
                        be thoroughly misunderstood by the smaller European powers and that just
                        because he did not have a cabinet officer available there was no reason, in
                        our minds, why the British Government should undertake, on such short
                        notice, to announce the dissolution. I told him that I knew the official
                        British press representatives had given out a report that Lloyd George was
                        here to close up the Conference. This he denied.</p>
                    <p>At our meeting on Monday<note n="98" xml:id="d336fn98">See HD–53, minutes 4
                            and 7, <ref target="frus1919Parisv08#pg_203">vol. <hi rend="smallcaps"

                                target="frus1919Parisv08#pg_209">209</ref>.</note> all the other
                        powers insisted that we should wind up pending matters before discussing
                        dissolution and Lloyd George agreed to appoint Eyre Crowe Plenipotentiary to
                        represent Great Britain. I told Lloyd George on Tuesday morning just before
                        he left that we rather resented this attempt on his part to create the
                        impression that the Council was all through, not only because it was not a
                        fact, but also because it was discourteous to the United States
                        representatives to have the matter handled the way it <pb n="647"
                            xml:id="pg_647" facs="0685"/>had been. He tried to assure me that we
                        misunderstood his position, but again spoke of our dissolving in ten days
                        after pending matters are cleared up. I told him it was absolutely out of
                        the question to dissolve until the Bulgarian and Hungarian treaties had been
                        concluded. British Press representatives tell me that Lloyd George gave this
                        impression in order to protect himself from attack in the House of Commons
                        as the expenses of the Peace Conference have been criticized. Polk.</p>

                    <p>1410. Strictly confidential for the President from Colonel House. I have been
                        going over the situation here with Polk and find that, aside from pending
                        business with which I have not been in touch, there are five principal
                        problems:</p>
                    <p>1st. Italy, which depends so entirely upon your decision that it needs
                        virtually no negotiation at this end.</p>
                    <p>2d. Roumania, which is being handled by the Supreme Council in conjunction
                        with the Allied mission at Budapest.</p>
                    <p>3rd. The Hungarian treaty and recognition of a Hungarian Government. The
                        treaty is ready and the only question is therefore one of when a responsible
                        government is formed to receive the document.</p>
                    <p>4th. The Russian situation, which, in the opinions of all of us, is a matter
                        which should be handled through the Foreign Offices since no decision is
                        possible here with the Heads of Governments no longer sitting.</p>
                    <p>5th. The Turkish treaty. I have talked with George, who feels that nothing
                        can be done with this until it is known whether the United States will take
                        mandates. The others are of the same opinion; even after that is determined,
                        a different and more technical delegation will be required. In our opinion
                        it will not be necessary to keep more than one commissioner here to carry on
                        negotiations, particularly since you have certain definite policies which
                        can be laid down and there are few difficult boundary questions.</p>
                    <p>With regard to mandates types B and C, our good offices for the French
                        reservations concerning black armies in Togoland and the Cameroons are quite
                        finished. The French, as you know, though never opposing the principle of
                        mandates over ex-Turkish territorial waters [<hi rend="italic"
                            >territories?</hi>], think it inexpedient to draft any general type A
                        mandate at this time, believing that each mandate of the A class will be
                        radically different from the others and must depend upon the size and
                        character of the territories as they shall be arranged by the Supreme
                        Council. There is a certain logic in this and at all events the French will
                        not yield the point. Therefore Lord Milner believes that no further action
                        should be taken on mandates until the time of the Turkish treaty, which may
                        not be until the turn of the year.</p>

                    <p>The British have let their plenipotentiaries go and have only Eyre Crowe here
                        with the rank of an ambassador. The Italians, now that Tittoni is away, have
                        Scialoja, a man of no particular distinction. The Japanese are represented
                        by their Ambassador, so that, under the circumstances, the presence of four
                        American Commissioners seems not only unnecessary but may lead to criticism
                        in the United States.</p>
                    <p>Polk will report to the Department in a few days certain plans he has in mind
                        for winding up the work of the Commission as soon as the Hungarian and the
                        Bulgarian treaties are completed. Inasmuch as I shall doubtless be called
                        eventually to testify before the Senate committee it seems advisable that I
                        should give my testimony when it will be helpful. I am sailing between the
                        1st and 10th of October.</p>
                    <p>I have shown this to Polk, who agrees. Edward House.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Lansing</hi>: I came over here about ten days
                        ago hoping to be able to finish up Mandate A. Lord Milner also came for the
                        same purpose. After consultation we found that it would be impossible to
                        [do] anything further with the mandates until the Turkish Treaty is
                        formulated. The French contend that there will necessarily be several forms
                        of mandate A, depending largely upon the character of the territory
                        involved.</p>
                    <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0687"/>
                    <p>I wanted to return home on the <hi rend="italic">Mauretania</hi> with Lord
                        Grey but the President was insistent that I remain for the present. It is
                        perfectly useless my being in Paris at this time. It is practically deserted
                        as far as the directing powers of the governments are concerned. It will be
                        necessary for Frank Polk or someone to remain until the Bulgarian and
                        Hungarian Treaties are ready, but in my opinion, the Hotel Crillon and the
                        entire staff, excepting what Polk needs, should be discontinued. If this is
                        not done, we will be under the charge, and justly so, of undue extravagance.
                        They will also charge that I and the other Commissioners are being kept here
                        until the Treaty is ratified.</p>
                    <p>I have written and cabled to the President about this and I hope he will be
                        convinced that I have summed up the situation as it is.</p>
                    <p>I have never seen such glorious weather as we are having. It is a perfect joy
                        to be back in Paris after two months in England.</p>

                    <p>3291. From Phillips for Polk. To be deciphered personally by Mr. Polk. Your
                        number 4427 of September 29. Admiral Grayson tells me that the President is
                        troubled by nervous exhaustion which has given rise, to a number of
                        complications, including completely upset digestion. He also is suffering
                        from an attack of asthma and has a great deal of difficulty in sleeping. He
                        will not be able to take up any work whatsoever this week. Grayson believes
                        that by next week he will be able to do a little work. He is much better
                        today than he has been and Grayson is encouraged.</p>

                    <p>3328. Confidential for Polk from the Secretary. I am disposed to think that
                        the time has almost come when the work of the Supreme Council should
                        practically cease and permit the various negotiations growing out of the
                        treaties to take their normal course through the respective Foreign Offices.
                        Before reaching a conclusion I should be glad to have a report from you as
                        to whether in your opinion the American representation could not now be
                        withdrawn. In this event Ambassador Wallace could be authorized to sign on
                        behalf of the United States. Please telegraph your views and at same time
                        advise me of status of Hungarian Treaty.</p>

                    <p>115. Your 509, October 2, 10 a.m. Following received by Commission on October
                        4th regarding President’s condition and is repeated for your information.
                        This, however, is a news summary and therefore is not official.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>“All papers carry as leading features today the President’s illness. A
                            consultation of physicians including Doctor Grayson, Rear Admiral Stitt,
                            head of the Naval Hospital, and Dr. Ruffin agreed the President is
                            suffering from nervous exhaustion brought on by the strain of his work
                            at the Peace Conference and his recent tour of this country. Doctor
                            Grayson said ‘The President is a very sick man’. The bulletin issued by
                            Doctor Grayson is as follows ‘At 12:15 p.m., the President’s condition
                            is unchanged’. Previous bulletins last night stated ‘The President is a
                            sick man. His condition is less favorable today and he has remained in
                            bed throughout the day’.”</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>Confidentially, the Commission’s information is that the President is very
                        ill. For instructions requested by you, Commission suggests that you await a
                        reply from Washington. Fortunately, prior to the President’s illness his
                        emphatic decision conveyed to you regarding Fiume removes all doubt relative
                        to this question.</p>

                    <p>3366. From Phillips to be deciphered by Polk. Admiral Grayson told Assistant
                        Secretary Long today that the President is in a state of highly nervous
                        exhaustion and that it is necessary that he be kept from any contact with
                        the outside world, even from newspapers. He is still very sick and the
                        process of recovery will be long, with six weeks of complete rest as a
                        minimum.</p>

                        anxious to get home, but, in our opinion, the Roumanian situation must be
                        straightened out by the delegates. It is a hard and sometimes a personal
                        fight and we believe it would embarrass the Ambassador to have to carry on
                        those negotiations. It would also be our view that the Italian question is
                        one that could not be handled by the Ambassador for the same reason.</p>

                        <item>The Hungarian treaty is dependent primarily on Roumania. Until we come
                            to an understanding with them, terms cannot be agreed on. As I said
                            above, negotiations on this question would seem to require presence of
                            the Commission with experts. Have discussed plan with Doctor Scott and
                            others of first coming to an agreement with the Roumanians. When that is
                            done we could then sign a treaty or protocol with the various
                            governments that take territory from Hungary, covering the cession and
                            occupation of this territory, complete all details except the actual
                            signing by the Hungarian Government and leave the treaty for execution
                            by Ambassador when a Government is formed. Treaty is entirely ready. Sir
                            Eyre Crowe, speaking for the British, thinks that my plan is feasible.
                            It may be that when the Roumanians withdraw, as we hope they will do in
                            the next ten days, a government with which we can treat will be
                            created.</item>

                        for the next meeting of the Council. Please let me know as soon as possible
                        who is to be the American representative. Great Britain has designated its
                        Ambassador, Lord Derby. I understand that France will name Monsieur
                        Berthelot and Japan its Ambassador, Monsieur Matsui. Polk.</p>

                        understanding with regard to Committee to Coordinate the interpretation and
                        execution of the clauses of the Treaty with Germany was that it should be
                        composed of the diplomatic representatives in Paris and should have its
                        headquarters there. Is this your understanding? If this was the agreement,
                        of course we will act accordingly. What will be required in the way of
                        assistants and clerical force?</p>

                    <p>4826. [From Polk.] Your confidential 3482, October 18, 6 p.m. Your
                        understanding in regard to committee on coordination of interpretation and
                        execution of the treaty clauses with Germany is entirely correct. The origin
                        of [<hi rend="italic">original</hi>] proposal of having the different
                        Ambassadors as heads of the various delegations on this committee was made
                        by the British [, undoubtedly] with the idea that the committee would merely
                        serve as a clearing house between the commission[s] functioning in Germany
                        and the Allied and Associated Governments. Lately it has been proposed with
                        the support of the French and Italian delegates to extend the scope of the
                        committee so as to constitute a consultative body to consider matters of
                        importance arising out of the treaty. In the interim reparation committee,
                        where the matter was discussed yesterday, the British delegate stated
                        emphatically that he was against resurrecting the ghost of the Supreme
                        Council after it had departed. The subject will undoubtedly shortly be
                        further discussed in the Supreme Council.</p>
                    <p>France has named Monsieur Pichon with Monsieur Berthelot as alternate; and
                        Great Britain, Japan and Italy their respective Ambassadors. Should the
                        American Ambassador be designated as the American delegate on this committee
                        it might be well to make the appointment run to him “[or his]
                        representative”.</p>

                    <p>4823. [From Polk.] Commission has under consideration what disposition shall
                        be made of its files when the Commission is finally dissolved and is
                        inclined to believe that it would be very desirable to have all files
                        transferred to the Embassy for at least a certain period of time before they
                        are finally sent to Washington. The reasons for this are: <list>

                            <item>Many matters will still be pending which will require reference to

                            <item>Department already has great butt: of material on Commission’s
                                files, as this is included in telegrams and despatches to and from

                            <item>Commission could send to Embassy someone who is familiar with
                                filing system;</item>
                            <label>(5)</label>
                            <item>It is believed that the Department has copies of all S. H.
                                Bulletins, minutes and other mimeographed matter which are on
                                Commission’s files. Department also has all printed reports, et
                                cetera;</item>
                            <label>(6)</label>
                            <item>Work in Paris could be handled with more expedition if files were
                                here. Necessity of cabling to Washington for information on many
                                points would also be eliminated.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>The above is of course based on the supposition that the Peace Commission as
                        a separate unit will be dissolved before the work of the Conference is
                        concluded and that the Embassy will handle questions left unsettled. Under
                        these circumstances it is believed that the Department will appreciate the
                        desirability of having these files remain until a date can be determined
                        when their presence in Paris will not be so essential as to warrant
                        retention. Your views are requested. Polk.</p>

                        to stay here to wind up Commission. Bulgarian treaty will be signed next
                        week. British and ourselves are trying to force settlement of Hungarian
                        question. Confidentially, do not think ratifications of German treaty will
                        be deposited until about 25th. Assume these details in connection with
                        ratification, even though we may have ratified, could be carried out by
                        Ambassador. If Fiume is not settled, these negotiations can be carried on
                        through State Department. Crowe and I announced this morning informally that
                        we expected to leave without fail latter part of month. Of course all this
                        is subject to Secretary’s wishes. Please show him this telegram and cable me
                        his impressions.</p>
                    <p>Attitude of French and Italians is so unsatisfactory in connection with

                        this matter was straightened out.</p>
                    <p>Do you think it would be possible to persuade the proper authorities to send
                            <hi rend="italic">George Washington</hi> back for another trip to bring

                    <p>5006. [From Polk.] Your 3637, November 1, 5 p.m. Mission has in course of
                        preparation much of the data requested and will forward same at the earliest
                        possible moment.</p>
                    <p>It will be impossible to secure duplicate minutes of the Council of Four, of
                        which Mission has had only three sets, one of which is on file here, one
                        given to the President and one to Mr. Lansing.</p>
                    <p>With reference to the minutes of the Heads of Delegations, Mission has two
                        sets of these which are constantly used here, but one of which could be
                        forwarded the Department in case Department’s file has been so scattered
                        that it must be replaced by a new file. It is practically impossible to
                        procure additional copies of the earlier numbers of H. D. Minutes, as they
                        were furnished us by the British Delegation and only a very limited number
                        was available. Please advise specifically whether Department desires Mission
                        to forward one of its two sets of H, D. Minutes.</p>
                    <p>In other respects, Mission will endeavor to furnish Department with the
                        fullest possible indexes and files and will cable later as to when these may
                        be expected. Polk.</p>

                        4958. I really think that it would be best for you to return on the <hi

                        I appreciate that there are many important problems which you are handling
                        in Paris but I think that many of these could now properly be transferred to
                        the State Department. From here you will have even a stronger position in
                        handling these problems. The <hi rend="italic">George Washington</hi> is
                        about to be transferred to the War Department which plans to keep her in the

                    <p>5040. Strictly confidential and urgent. For Secretary of State from Polk.
                        Your 3675 November 5th, 3 p.m. Am most anxious to <pb n="658"
                            xml:id="pg_658" facs="0696"/>get home for personal and business reasons,
                        but after careful consideration and discussing matter with my colleagues, I
                        feel it will be impossible for me to leave next Wednesday. They feel it
                        would make an extremely bad impression to leave on such short notice when
                        there are several matters that require a settlement. The Bulgarian treaty
                        will be signed next week. That of course is merely formal. We are carrying
                        on active negotiations in regard to Hungary and are not [<hi rend="italic"
                            >sic</hi>] hopeful of getting a government with which we can treat. The
                        Galician question is merely awaiting decision of Lloyd George before being
                        disposed of. Tanker case still unsettled. The negotiations in connection
                        with putting the treaty in effect could not be postponed and Harrison and
                        others feel that our position would be jeopardized if I should leave.</p>
                    <p>In using two weeks more I can have the matters now pending, either settled or
                        transferred to the Department. In other words, it is my idea that when we
                        leave here the Department and Ambassador will already be handling the
                        unfinished business. As it is now there are too many loose ends to leave
                        without creating hopeless confusion.</p>
                    <p>Under the circumstances, unless there are other reasons which I do not
                        appreciate, I feel I should stay on until the end of the month. General
                        Bliss, Mr. White and myself are most anxious to leave here as near the 1st
                        of December as possible. Could you let me know if the <hi rend="italic"
                            >George Washington</hi> can come back at that time? We have some
                        personnel and many records which should be kept together. The other
                        transports would not be large enough to accommodate our party. If the <hi
                            rend="italic">George Washington</hi> cannot come back, I will arrange to
                        sail about the 1st of December on some English ship but we would much prefer
                        to leave on that boat. In view of the fact that this Commission does
                        represent Government and in view of consideration other governments show
                        their representatives, it would seem that War and Navy Departments would not
                        hesitate to grant request of Department.</p>
                    <p>Please let me know immediately your views and wishes. Polk.</p>

                        feel that it is very important that the original idea of the functions of
                        the committee on co-ordination be maintained. This government cannot agree
                        to permitting the committee to become a continuation of the Supreme Council.
                        Please make it clear to your associates that the committee can merely be
                        used as a clearing house between commissions functioning in Germany and the
                        Allied and Associated Governments.</p>
                    <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0698"/>
                    <p>Department intends to designate Ambassador Wallace as our delegate, but his
                        official appointment cannot be made until we ratify the treaty, and until it
                        becomes clear whether ratification of such appointments must be made by the
                        Senate.</p>
                    <p>I agree with you as to the desirability of using Harrison as assistant to the
                        Ambassador, in view of my 3613;<note n="4" xml:id="d362fn4">Not
                            printed.</note> I see no difficulty in making this arrangement.</p>
                    <p>I do not feel that it is necessary or desirable that Doctor Scott remain in
                        Paris for duties in connection with this committee. Department is not yet
                        ready to make arrangements for the Turkish treaty. Therefore I prefer that
                        Doctor Scott come home when the Peace Conference shall cease to need
                        him.</p>
                    <p>Regarding clerical force please consult with Ambassador Wallace and Harrison.
                        If the Embassy cannot supply sufficient force, can you furnish additional
                        clerks from your personnel when the Peace Commission breaks up?</p>

                    <p>5137. From Polk for the Secretary of State. I understand from telegrams that
                        treaty may possibly be rejected. What position do you desire Peace Mission
                        to take here in that event? If the treaty is defeated and the decision is
                        final, it would seem possible for someone to raise a question in regard to
                        our continuing to sit in the preparation of other treaties along the lines
                        of the treaty with Germany. Should Commission withdraw or continue to
                        participate in discussions of Bulgarian and other treaty questions? In the
                        latter <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0699"/>case, the position of the
                        Commission might seem to be inconsistent. I would appreciate receiving your
                        views at the earliest moment possible. Polk.</p>

                    <p>3769. Confidential to Polk. Your 5137, November 12, 10 a.m. I have no
                        opportunity to confer with President on this subject as he is still
                        seriously ill and Grayson does not desire him to have questions submitted
                        which require constructive thought. While your hypothesis is possible and a
                        natural one judging by the votes taken as to the Lodge Reservations, the
                        tactics adopted by Hitchcock contemplate the adoption of the reservations in
                        Committee of the whole. He proposes then to defeat the ratification
                        resolution with the reservations which will leave the way clear to taking up
                        compromise reservations which he has already introduced. Of course he may be
                        defeated in carrying through this plan and if so your inquiry becomes
                        pertinent.</p>
                    <p>I cannot give you any idea as to the President’s views but my own are that we
                        would have to discontinue our connection with the work of drafting other
                        treaties since the chief reason for our participation in them, particularly
                        the Bulgarian and Turkish, is that under the Covenant we are bound to unite
                        in the guaranty of their terms. With the Covenant rejected the reason for
                        our being a party largely disappears. While the same state of affairs does
                        not exist in regard to the Hungarian treaty, I think that it would probably
                        be bad policy to attempt to negotiate a treaty embodying the Covenant or
                        confiding any powers to the League of Nations.</p>
                    <p>Of course the President may hold another opinion.</p>

                    <p>5187. For the Secretary of State from Polk: Following is list of questions
                        which, according to the Secretary-General of the Peace Conference, have not
                        been disposed of. I will give them in the order presented with our comments
                        after each subject:</p>
                    <p>1. Execution of treaty with Germany. Conditions governing the resumption of
                        diplomatic relations.</p>
                    <p>A report will be made to the Conference. There is no real difference except
                        that Italy is rather anxious to send an Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>2. Reorganization of the Superior War Council at Versailles to centralize the
                        measures of execution concerning the military clauses of the Peace Treaty in
                        Germany and in the different occupied territories.</p>
                    <p>I have your 3665, November 4, 3 p.m.<note n="5" xml:id="d367fn5">Not
                            printed.</note></p>
                    <p>3. Extradition and trial of the Kaiser.</p>
                    <p>No report has been made on that as yet. If this matter is not disposed of
                        before Mission leaves, Ambassador could be charged with the duty of
                        conveying the instructions of the Department.</p>
                    <p>4. Nomination of the members of the Commission entrusted with the comparison
                        of the lists of culprits presented by the different Powers and to regulate a
                        procedure for the mixed tribunals.</p>
                    <p>If this matter is not disposed of before December 1st the Ambassador could
                        convey views of Department if we have any intention of mixing in this
                        matter. Your views on this question and the question of the trial of the
                        Kaiser would be appreciated.</p>
                    <p>5. Togo and Cameroun. Employment of native contingents for the defense of
                        metropolitan and colonial territory.</p>
                    <p>This is a point that has to do with mandates and should go to the Council of
                        the League of Nations, as mandates have not been completed and we believe it
                        is not time to take any of these matters up now.</p>
                    <p>6. Signing of treaty with Austria by Serbs and Roumanians and signing of
                        minority treaties by those powers.</p>
                    <p>We are reaching an agreement with the Serbs. The Roumanian question promises
                        to remain open. This could be handled through the Ambassador, getting his
                        instructions from the Department.</p>
                    <p>7. Execution of treaty with Bulgaria. Question of the attribution of
                        Bulgarian Thrace.</p>
                    <p>This will probably be disposed of before we leave.</p>
                    <p>8. Treaty with Hungary. Question of total or partial payment of the Roumanian
                        occupation expenses.</p>
                    <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0701"/>
                    <p>If not disposed of this should go to Reparation Committee.</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Furnishing of coal to Hungary by Poland and
                        Czechs.</p>
                    <p>This should go to Reparation Committee.</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Exploitation of the Pecs Mines.</p>
                    <p>This is a question of getting the Serbs out of Hungarian territory. If not
                        disposed of by December 1st it can be left to the Ambassador. It is a simple
                        question.</p>

                    <p>This should be referred to Reparation Committee in consultation with
                        Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>11. Question of the Adriatic. Frontiers between Italy and Serbia. Fiume,
                        Montenegro and Albania.</p>
                    <p>All these questions are considered by the Council as inter-dependent. If not
                        disposed of by December 1st they should, in my opinion, be handled by the
                        Department and either through the Ambassador here or the Ambassador in
                        London.</p>
                    <p>12. Russian and Baltic questions. Recognition of Admiral Koltchak; Finland
                        (Petchenga and Carelia); Aland Islands; Baltic States; Eastern frontiers of
                        Poland; Ukrainia; Bessarabia; Caucasus State; Repatriation of the Allied
                        contingents in Siberia; Repatriation of enemy prisoners in Russia.</p>
                    <p>All these questions, with the exception of those hereinafter noted, in my
                        opinion, and I have always taken this position in the Council, should be
                        handled through the various foreign offices as they are not questions for
                        discussion in the Supreme Council. This view was approved November 11th with
                        the exception of Bessarabia and the <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0702"
                        />repatriation of allied contingents and prisoners in Russia. As to
                        Bessarabia the British and French showed a disposition to discuss matter and
                        in some way to hand over this territory to Roumania. I made two objections
                        to this plan, first, that I do not think now is the time to discuss the
                        dismemberment of the Russian Empire and, second, that I think it would be a
                        fatal mistake to consider giving Roumania any more territory in view of its
                        defiant attitude. I think the European governments will agree with me on the
                        first point, but if Roumania by any chance shows itself to be more
                        reasonable, which I very much doubt, it may be that the question of their
                        being given some sort of a mandate on Bessarabia will come up. I would be
                        glad to get your views.</p>
                    <p>I would remind you that Roumania has refused to discuss the question of
                        Dobrudja under any circumstances and the European Allies have taken the
                        position that they cannot attempt to deprive a friendly power of
                        territory.</p>
                    <p>13. Treaty with Turkey.</p>
                    <p>As to this there is no disposition to take up the question at this Conference
                        on the part of the British or Italians.</p>
                    <p>14. Treaty with Belgium and the Netherlands for the revision of the Treaties
                        of 1889 [<hi rend="italic">1839</hi>].</p>
                    <p>This may be disposed of before we leave. If not it should go to the
                        Department.</p>
                    <p>I have given you at length the subjects to be disposed of but have omitted
                        topics which are actually in process of being settled such as the Bulgarian
                        Treaty, Galicia, arrangements for the meeting of the League of Nations and
                        other matters.</p>
                    <p>It is evident that the ratifications will not be delivered until after the
                        1st of December. It will, therefore, be necessary for the Ambassador,
                        assuming the treaty has not actually been defeated, to be charged with the
                        duty of attending to such details as have not been covered in connection
                        with the ratification of the treaty and the first meeting of the League. It
                        is true that we will not be represented, but it is necessary for us to see
                        that nothing is done which would be prejudicial to our interests. There is
                        no disposition, as far as I can see, on the part of any of the governments
                        to proceed in the matter of the League without a full understanding with
                        us.</p>
                    <p>In connection with your 3706, November 6 [<hi rend="italic">8</hi>] in regard
                        to the negotiations of the Coordinations Committee, I call your attention to
                        the resolution creating the Committee adopted July 23rd [<hi rend="italic"
                            >28th</hi>].<note n="6" xml:id="d367fn6">See HD–17, minute 1 and

                        reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The questions concerning the interpretation and execution of the
                                treaty with Germany—with the exception of those confided either to
                                    <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0703"/>the Society of Nations,
                                Separation Commissions, Naval and Aerial and Military Control, the
                                left Bank of the Rhine, or to other permanent organs of the same
                                nature—should be studied and followed by a special committee whose
                                seat will be in Paris but which can, should it be judged opportune
                                by reason of the nature of certain questions, be transported to
                                other capitals.”</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>According to this resolution you will notice that the Ambassadors’ Committee
                        or Committee on Coordination, has practically no powers as the important
                        committees are clearly to be independent. There is no great objection to
                        that in my mind except in the case of the Committees of Military, Naval and
                        Air Control and those committees should be under the Ambassador. But quite
                        apart from the duties contemplated in the resolution of July 23 [<hi
                            rend="italic">28</hi>], there will be certain questions, as you will
                        observe from reading the list above, which will require our having some sort
                        of representative in the proposed ambassadorial committee for the purpose at
                        least of conveying the views of the Government to this Committee. As you can
                        see, it would be difficult for us to leave here arbitrarily on or about the
                        1st of December unless it is the intention to charge someone with the duty
                        of tying up the loose ends in a limited number of subjects. It would not be
                        fair to our Allies or to the questions involved. The questions are simple
                        and the understanding would be that the Ambassador would act only on
                        instructions from his Government. Wallace would have the assistance of Grew
                        and Harrison and I think such arrangement would be possible. Please consider
                        this particular point and let me have your views.</p>
                    <p>As you will see, I am assuming that we will all leave here on or about
                        December 1st. This I have told my colleagues and they are expecting us to
                        leave at about that time, but, as I have already pointed out, we cannot
                        leave the pending questions I have suggested entirely in the air.</p>
                    <p>As you will notice, Wallace would have two functions: (1) A member of the
                        Coordinating Committee to carry out the terms of the treaty, this to depend
                        upon our ratifying the treaty; (2) to sit in the Ambassadors’ Committee for
                        the purpose of completing such unfinished business as we are justified in
                        leaving to them. If Wallace is not permitted to complete this work, we
                        really should leave a Commissioner behind, but I think the best plan is to
                        end the Peace Conference and have this Committee of Ambassadors clean up the
                        more or less important unfinished business. Polk.</p>

                    <p>In order to obviate confusion, the following information relative to the
                        various minutes of the Conference may prove of value.</p>
                    <p>At the beginning of the Conference the minutes were designated as minutes of
                        the “Council of Ten” or “Bureau Conference”, more commonly referred to as
                        B–C Minutes. These begin with B–C–a, January 12, 1919 and end at B–C 62,
                        June 17, 1919.</p>
                    <p>On March 27 the Council of Foreign Ministers began to sit. The minutes of
                        these meetings are commonly called “FM Minutes” and number from FM 1, March
                        27, 1919, to FM 27, June 25, 1919, inclusive. A complete file of these
                        minutes is being forwarded in box number 4. The indexes of these two files
                        are as yet incomplete but it is hoped that they will be completed at an
                        early date when they will be immediately forwarded to the Department.</p>
                    <p>An element of confusion is encountered in this connection due to the fact
                        that at the time the American Delegation was issuing the BC Minutes and the
                        FM Minutes as described above, the same minutes were being issued by the
                        British Delegation with different reference numbers. The British referred to
                        them as minutes of the Interallied Conference and their reference numbers
                        were preceded by the letters IC. Their series, corresponding to the American
                        Delegation’s BC and <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0706"/>FM Minutes,
                        number from IC 103, January 12, 1919, to IC 199 [<hi rend="italic"
                            >201A?</hi>], July 5, 1919. The minutes following the date July 5, 1919
                        constitute the beginning of the HD Minutes or minutes of the Heads of
                        Delegations. Owing to the fact that the British Delegation furnished us with
                        copies of many documents and that that delegation prepared parts of the
                        index used by us, it is necessary to understand the British system of
                        numbering as well as the American system.</p>
                    <p>On March 20 the Council of Heads of States, more commonly called the Council
                        of Four, began to sit. These minutes were received from the British
                        Delegation, and their numbers in this series have been used exclusively by
                        the American Commission. From March 20 to May 7, they used an irregular
                        system of numbering not understood by us, but which for purposes of
                        convenience, has been used in our index references. Between these dates the
                        following minutes were furnished us by the British Delegation and represent
                        our complete file of minutes of the Council of Four during the period
                        mentioned: <table rows="16" cols="3" rendition="#center-block"

                    <p>Beginning with July 5, when the Heads of Delegations began to sit, the
                        minutes are designated as HD Minutes. These begin with Number IC 201 [<hi

                        with the consecutive numbers to date. It will be difficult for the Mission
                        to furnish a complete file of HD Minutes, and in the absence of specific

                    <p>5285. From Polk. Many thanks for your 3801. Notified French we were leaving
                        Paris 4th or 5th of December. Will you be kind enough to arrange with War
                        Department to have <hi rend="italic">America</hi> sail December 6th? I will
                        probably return on <hi rend="italic">America</hi>. We are already in touch
                        with General Connor arranging for shipping personnel and files. Am leaving
                        for London tomorrow and will be back Tuesday. Looking forward to seeing you
                        soon. Polk.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: Mr. Tumulty, after seeing
                        you yesterday, telephoned me that you opposed any statement being made at
                        the present time in regard to the Senate’s refusal to ratify the treaty <pb
                            n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0708"/>but at the same time desired
                        matters abroad to continue as they are, which I assume means that we should
                        keep our unofficial representatives in Paris to act as advisers and
                        observers in connection with the various commissions provided for in the
                        treaty and also that our representative should sit on the Supreme Council
                        and that our commissioners should sign the Bulgarian treaty.</p>
                    <p>As to the omission of any statement at this time I do not think there is any
                        argument in favor of making one.</p>
                    <p>The continuance of our unofficial activities in Paris is more or less a
                        question of expediency. The removal of our people would unquestionably
                        affect adversely commercial and financial interests in this country. They
                        would enter protests against this course and could be met by the justifiable
                        statement that in view of the Senate’s action we could not continue. The
                        consequence would be, I believe, indignation toward the Senators and strong
                        pressure upon them to reverse their action. Already I am beginning to
                        receive evidences of the apprehension with which our business men and
                        financiers view the situation in which the Senate has left American
                        interests. It might be well to increase this resentment against the
                        opponents of the treaty by not attempting to relieve the difficulties of
                        commerce and trade by continuing to participate unofficially in the
                        relations created by the provisions of the treaty. The blame is bound to
                        fall, as it should, upon the Senate in insisting on nullifying
                        reservations.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, if we continue the activities in which we have been
                        engaged, the Senate may raise some question as to the propriety of our doing
                        so, and refuse to make the necessary appropriation to pay for the men
                        employed. The Emergency Fund, already overtaxed by royal visits and the
                        regular work of the Department, is quite inadequate to meet this expense,
                        and its use for the proposed continuance is open to question. It will
                        require an appropriation. I am doubtful if that can be obtained if the
                        expenditures are predicated on a final ratification of the treaty. Before
                        the action of the Senate on the treaty they could make no complaint, but now
                        the conditions are different and they may and probably would refuse to
                        reimburse the fund, which would seriously cripple the necessary work of the
                        Department. Of course this does not apply to work under the terms of the
                        armistice.</p>
                    <p>In view of this state of affairs I believe that careful consideration should
                        be given as to whether it would not be politic to withdraw our men from
                        Europe and let the people draw the conclusion, which would be the right one,
                        that we had done so because of the Senate’s action.</p>
                    <p>As to our representative on the Supreme Council I think that he should be
                        continued—at least until ratifications are deposited by three <pb n="671"
                            xml:id="pg_671" facs="0709"/>of the Principal Powers, when, naturally,
                        the functions of the Supreme Council will be in large measure ended,
                        although I anticipate that he will be less influential than he has been
                        prior to the Senate’s action, because foreign governments will undoubtedly
                        assume that the American Government is divided as to questions of policy.
                        Possibly this question of continuance requires no consideration as there is
                        a general intention on the part of the Council to dissolve early in
                        December, since the members feel, particularly the American and British,
                        that their usefulness is at an end. They have made all their arrangements
                        for departure and, as I felt that the work they are now doing, could be done
                        as well, if not better, through regular diplomatic channels, I have not
                        discouraged them.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the Bulgarian Treaty and our participation in it as a signatory
                        there is a clear question of policy. We never were at war with Bulgaria and
                        we never broke off diplomatic relations with her. We took part in the
                        negotiations on the theory that under Article X we were bound to guarantee
                        the settlements and therefore should have a voice in reaching them and
                        should also be a party to the treaty. We did take part in the negotiations
                        and were able, I believe, to obtain more just treatment for Bulgaria than
                        she could have obtained if left to the rapacity and hatred of her neighbors.
                        With the treaty ready for signature our chief service has been rendered.
                        Ought we in view of the Senate’s action to proceed further and sign the
                        treaty? So far as the effect on Bulgaria is concerned I do not see that it
                        makes the least difference whether we do or not, but it may have an effect
                        on the situation here if we proceed on the assumption that the reason for
                        continuing is as strong now as it was before the Senate refused to ratify
                        the treaty with Article X in it. Personally I am uncertain which policy is
                        the wiser and more expedient. There is of course no legal reason why we
                        should not be a party to the treaty regardless of what has taken place, but
                        it is for you to decide whether or not it is politic to do so in view of
                        what has occurred.</p>
                    <p>I am sorry, Mr. President, to disturb you with so long a letter, but I feel
                        that I should know your views in order that I may carry out your policy. I
                        hope most sincerely that your recovery from now on will be speedy; and you
                        may be sure that I will endeavor so far as I am able to avoid annoying you
                        with the vexatious questions which seem to multiply rather than decrease
                        because of the inexcusable delay in the ratification of the treaty and even
                        more because of the disturbed political and economic state in so many
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Faithfully yours,</p>

                    <p>3906. In view of the failure of the Senate to ratify the Treaty the President
                        feels that you should withdraw immediately the American representatives on
                        all Commissions growing out of or dependent on either the Peace Conference
                        or the Treaty except those dealing with Reparations Commission which are
                        being further considered by the President. The Department feels that this
                        Government has an interest apart from the Treaty in keeping in touch with
                        economic and financial questions. Of course the foregoing does not apply to
                        matters pertaining entirely to the armistice. After receiving the
                        President’s views a further telegram on this subject will be forwarded to
                        you.</p>
                    <p>Pending your departure from Paris you should continue to represent the United
                        States on the Supreme Council, with the understanding that any matters
                        requiring a definite expression of opinion by this Government must be
                        referred to the Department.</p>
                    <p>With reference to the withdrawal of American representatives on all

                                of Peace. A reconsideration of this decision might be possible
                                should a request of the interested Powers (Czecho-Slovakia and
                                Poland) be made to this Government in the premises.</item>

                    <p>Should the question arise as to the participation of this Government in the
                        Commissions provided for by the Austrian, Hungarian or Bulgarian Treaties,
                        you may inform your colleagues that the position of the United States with
                        reference to these other treaties is the same as outlined above with
                        reference to the German Treaty.</p>
                    <p>In view of this situation the Department would be glad if you could arrange
                        to sail with personnel of the Commission at an earlier date than December
                        6th, provided that could be arranged by you with General Connor.</p>
                    <p>With reference to the questions outlined in your 5187, November 14, 8 p.m. I
                        agree, that matters which have not been settled when the Supreme Council
                        ceases to function, might possibly be referred to the Committee of
                        Ambassadors or handled by the Reparations Committee or the Department
                        respectively as you suggest. For the present, however, I feel that the
                        United States should not be represented on the Committee of Ambassadors and
                        I shall instruct Ambassador Wallace accordingly. After your departure from
                        Paris matters which require the action of this Government should be
                        presented to the Department through the usual diplomatic channels.</p>
                    <p>For your information and guidance I should add that until the Senate takes
                        some action, the Department proposes to express no opinion concerning
                        questions arising under the terms of the Treaty except those in which it may
                        interest itself because of the necessity to protect American interests.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: As agreed this morning, I am
                        sending you herewith a brief summary of what I said, commending it to your
                        most serious and friendly attention.</p>
                    <p>My Government who has every reason to count on American goodwill, considers
                        that the departure at the present juncture of the American delegation in
                        Paris would have a deplorable effect. The fact that <pb n="674"
                            xml:id="pg_674" facs="0712"/>the treaty is held here in abeyance, its
                        fate being doubtful, and no action having been taken with the French one,
                        has awakened among the Germans the hope that our intimacy and therefore our
                        force is on the wane. The ratifications which were to be exchanged by us
                        with them on December first have been postponed by them and new and
                        unexpected objections raised to our requests for a strict observance of the
                        clauses of the armistice.</p>
                    <p>If now, when important questions remain to be solved, and will be in a short
                        time, your delegates were to shake the dust of France off their feet the
                        Germans would feel still more encouraged, and your allies the reverse.</p>
                    <p>There are more than one question the solving of which may be delayed and for
                        which there would be no need for your delegates to stay: the Russian, the
                        Turkish or even the Italo-Adriatic ones. But others, of the gravest import,
                        will be settled in a few days, and no one would understand our being left
                        before that moment. Of that number are, the exchange of ratifications with
                        Germany which will mark the real beginning of the peace; the signing, which
                        seems imminent, of the Austrian and Bulgarian treaties, by the Serbs and the
                        Roumanians, the signing of the Hungarian treaty greatly desired by the
                        American delegation: a new democratic Government has been established in
                        Hungary; its delegates are soon expected in Paris and no difficulties are
                        foreseen.</p>
                    <p>A brief delay would surely suffice for all this work, and the continued
                        presence of your representatives would cause the enemy to understand that
                        they vainly hoped that there was any friction between us and they could take
                        advantage thereof. They would cease to refuse for instance, handing to us
                        for judgment those men whose names we know, who captured some honorable
                        French girls and sent them away to be used as white slaves. No worse crime
                        can be imagined.</p>
                    <p>My Government cannot believe that, when you have done so much with such
                        splendid effect, this little supplementary help will be denied us and it
                        wants me to beseech you to grant it. “No one in France, my telegram reads,
                        where the gratitude is profound towards the United States as well as the
                        trust in them, would understand their failing at this juncture the cause
                        which they have so nobly defended”.</p>
                    <p>Hoping that you will see your way to grant us a favor which I solicit in the
                        most earnest fashion, I beg you to believe me, my dear Mr. Secretary,</p>
                    <p>Most sincerely yours,</p>

                    <p>5468. For the Secretary of State from Polk. At Lloyd George’s request, had a
                        long and very interesting conversation with him on Monday.<note n="14"
                            xml:id="d377fn14">Mr. Polk was in London on Monday, November 24.</note>
                        I repeated all of my conversation to Davis<note n="15" xml:id="d377fn15"
                            >John W. Davis, American Ambassador in Great Britain.</note> and will
                        report here in general points touched on by the Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>He first inquired anxiously about the President’s health and expressed a keen
                        interest in his recovery.</p>
                    <p>1. Russia. He said Great Britain would not give any more assistance to
                        Denikin or Koltchak after the present supplies which had been set apart for
                        them were exhausted. He seemed to think their situation was serious and did
                        not see what more could be done to help them. In his opinion the time has
                        come to see if it is not possible to come to an understanding with the
                        Bolshevik Government. … He said that his information was that the Bolsheviks
                        were gaining but were anxious to make peace and were willing to recognize
                        their international obligations. He made no suggestion, however, for any
                        Inter-Allied Conference but apparently it is on his mind that such a
                        conference may be proposed.</p>
                    <p>2. Turkey. He and Curzon both told me that they are most anxious to have a
                        settlement of the Turkish question at the earliest possible moment. They see
                        a grave danger in letting the situation run any longer. He assumes that we
                        will not take a mandate on any terms and expressed keen regret as he said
                        that was the only real solution of the Turkish question. I rather gathered,
                        although he would not admit it, that he is favorable to the Greeks staying
                        in Smyrna and is apparently not unwilling that the Italians should have a
                        sphere of influence in southern Anatolia, but as to this I am not certain.
                        He realizes, as we here do, that the French are anxious to keep
                        Constantinople and Asia Minor intact and rather hope for a mandate for
                        themselves. He fears trouble between the French and the Arabs. It is
                        apparent that the English have not made up their minds in regard to
                        Mesopotamia. It is an expense to keep a large army there and they fear
                        complications with the Kurds and ultimately with Russia. I think they would
                        be willing, if there was any objection on the part of the other governments
                        to their actually taking Mesopotamia, merely to take a mandate for that
                        territory. They wish to hold the Turkish conference immediately, but, as you
                        know, the French are apparently unwilling for some reason to proceed. It has
                        been suggested that the French wished to wait until after the senatorial
                        elections in January. He asked who would negotiate for us <pb n="676"
                            xml:id="pg_676" facs="0714"/>and I told him that of course it depended
                        on the action of the Senate, but that I personally hoped we would have
                        nothing to do with it. He said it would be a calamity if we did not
                        participate. If we do take part and if meeting is held in London as they
                        insist, George said Davis could represent us as he had great influence with
                        the British. As to Armenia he does not see any necessity for a separate
                        mandate.</p>
                    <p>3. Germany. He is afraid that by pin-pricks France will succeed in upsetting
                        the present German Government. He feels that the German Government for
                        France’s own good should be protected as it is necessary to have Germany
                        become a commercial power if she is to discharge her obligations. He spoke
                        of the attitude of the military in the various occupied territories along
                        the Rhine and feared the French would drive the Germans into doing something
                        desperate. As for punishment of German officers he expressed great concern
                        when I told him that I thought the French were going to demand something
                        like six hundred officers. He spoke at length of the necessity for a good
                        understanding between the United States and Great Britain as the peace of
                        the world depended on our using our joint influence in Europe to restore
                        order.</p>
                    <p>He mentioned the question of competitive and naval building and said it would
                        be a tragedy if the United States and Great Britain should engage in any
                        such competition. He expressed regret over the <hi rend="italic"

                        well it never would have happened. I told him that wherever oil was involved
                        or the interest of the Dutch Shell or the Standard Oil Company there was
                        always a suspicion of intrigue on both sides. I pointed out the fact that
                        some of the activities of the French in the case of the tank ships had at
                        least given rise to some suspicions as to the motives back of the allocation
                        of those ships. I told him, however, I hoped to arrange a compromise.</p>
                    <p>4. Ireland. He said he hoped to be able to arrange some plan for Ireland as
                        it was a source of irritation between the two countries; that a committee
                        was then sitting and he hoped a plan would be ready shortly. He said that
                        the Irish had been most disloyal as Admiral Sims could testify; but that he
                        felt the good relations between the two countries required a compromise
                        rather than harsh treatment.</p>
                    <p>He and all the other British officials I have seen were most gratified over
                        the reception the Prince of Wales has received in the United States, as they
                        feel it is an indication of the real feeling between the two countries.<note

                    <p>5. League of Nations. He expressed great regret at the action of the Senate.
                        He did not intimate what would be done in case the United <pb n="677"
                            xml:id="pg_677" facs="0715"/>States did not ultimately ratify. Philip
                        Kerr, his confidential secretary and adviser, told me that they did not see
                        how they could accept any reservations and that the Foreign Office people
                        had advised them that it could not be done. I do not think, however, this is
                        final and think this was merely expressed to me for the purpose of getting
                        my reaction. I told him I did not know what the situation was, but assuming
                        mild reservations were inserted I did not see that it would hurt their
                        interests in any way.</p>
                    <p>Had a long talk with Curzon on Saturday, Davis being present, but there was
                        nothing said that was not included in my conversation with the Prime

                    <p>5491. For the Secretary of State from Polk. Have just seen copy of note
                        signed by Mr. Clemenceau and sent through Jusserand to you urging that the
                        Peace Mission be kept on after the 6th.<note n="18" xml:id="d378fn18">See

                                Government at any conference that might be held where our views were

                                for repetition to Clemenceau, that the United States Government
                                feels that the reparations for Scapa Flow are an unnecessary
                                hardship on the Germans and the United States regrets that the
                                British and French insisted on making this decision at this
                                time;</item>

                                not necessary in order to secure these signatures and that if a

                            <item>Treaty with Hungary. That you are informed that the Treaty is all
                                complete and all that is necessary is to secure the signature of
                                Hungary; that the United States Government could be represented in
                                signing by the Ambassador. You could also state with some emphasis
                                that if the Supreme Council had only taken a firm stand with
                                Roumania in August, as has been urged by the United States
                                Government, the Hungarian and Roumanian questions would have been
                                settled long ago; that the United States Government thoroughly
                                approves the stand now taken by the Supreme Council, but that it is
                                regretted that it was not taken sooner; that undoubtedly D’Annunzio
                                had been encouraged to defy the Supreme Council on account of the
                                consideration shown for the feelings of Roumania;</item>

                            <item>That the questions that remain are of not great importance and
                                those unsettled at the time of our departure can be disposed of by
                                the Council in conjunction with the Ambassador.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>You might also point out that at the present moment Italy is represented on
                        the Supreme Council by Martino, the future Ambassador to Berlin; that Great
                        Britain is represented by Sir Eyre Crowe, permanent Under-Secretary of
                        State; that Japan is represented by its Ambassador and that the United
                        States has been the only country that has maintained a Commission in
                        Paris.</p>
                    <p>I am convinced that if the publicity is properly handled here and in the
                        United States there can be no misconception in the minds of the Germans. For
                        that reason I think it is important that it should be stated that the
                        Ambassador is empowered to handle the Roumanian and Hungarian questions and
                        will whenever necessary consult with the Supreme Council with a view to
                        coordinating our relations with Germany. It should be pointed out also that
                        the French Government was told by me the 1st of November that we were going
                        home the 1st of December. I have intimated to Clemenceau and other officials
                        that it is a serious matter for the Commission to delay its departure owing
                        to the fact that it is difficult to secure transportation for such a large
                        party.</p>
                    <p>Please cable me immediately your views particularly as to Wallace taking over
                        the little work indicated above. It is important both in order to have the
                        work completed and for appearances. Polk.</p>

                    <p>5492. For Secretary of State from Polk: Your 3906 November 27th. Commission
                        fears that it has failed to make clear position it has taken in the past in
                        regard to the execution of the German treaty and which [<hi rend="italic"
                            >what?</hi>] it has consistently stated to be its position in view of
                        the treaty not being ratified. We have been most careful for over a month to
                        impress upon the Supreme Council that we could take no part in any of the
                        commissions created by the treaty and have so reported to the Department
                        from time to time.</p>

                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>Department will probably recall that I have telegraphed many times on
                            the subject of Rhineland Commission but it was never suggested that we
                            should appoint a permanent representative until we had ratified the
                            treaty. This Commission would call attention of the Department to the
                            very unfortunate situation that would be created by the withdrawal of
                            our temporary Commissioner, Mr. Noyes. <pb n="679" xml:id="pg_679"
                                facs="0717"/>We have been charged with certain administrative
                            functions in connection with the territory occupied by our troops and it
                            would be impossible to withdraw now [<hi rend="italic">Noyes?</hi>]
                            unless we also withdraw our troops as it would not be proper to my mind
                            to have French or British Commissioner functioning in the district with
                            our military forces. I will assume therefore that it is not intended to
                            withdraw Noyes.</item>

                            appointing and paying an American for this [work?] if they so desired. I

                        <item>As already indicated the Commission never assumed for one moment that
                            the United States would be represented on any geographic or boundary
                            commission and has so informed Council. The Department will probably
                            recall that we pointed this out on several occasions.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>The United States Government is not represented on any military or
                            naval commission created by the treaty and the Department has apparently
                            overlooked the fact that we have been holding officers in Paris for this
                            duty pending the ratification of the treaty and have not let them go
                            into Germany.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>The Commission notes the Department’s views in regard to a
                            representative on the Teschen Commission and will communicate them to
                            the Supreme Council and to the Czechs and Poles. The two latter powers
                            undoubtedly will request the United States to act.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>No question could possibly arise at this time in regard to our being
                        represented on commissions provided for by the Austrian, Hungarian and
                        Bulgarian treaty [<hi rend="italic">treaties</hi>] in view of the position
                        we have consistently taken in regard to the German treaty.</p>
                    <p>In regard to your recommendation that we should sail about December 6 we
                        would respectfully call the Department’s attention to the fact that we
                        notified the Department over three weeks ago that we desired to sail the
                        first week in December and many telegrams have been sent stating that we
                        would sail on the 6th. All arrangements to that end have already been
                        made.</p>
                    <p>When the Mission leaves there will be certain questions practically complete
                        but needing some slight attention such as the final terms in the Hungarian
                        treaty and our relations with Roumania. It would not be possible to my mind,
                        particularly in connection with the Roumanian matter, for us to withdraw
                        entirely. It will therefore be necessary for the Ambassador, in order to
                        complete these matters, to sit in the Supreme Council for a short time. The
                        matters are routine in character and have been practically settled but could
                        not be handled by the Allies with Washington. This is particularly true in
                        the case of Roumania; and, as we have been taking a firm and consistent
                        stand from the first, our withdrawal would be a great embarrassment to the
                        Allies, and would be great benefit [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to Roumania
                        and would <pb n="680" xml:id="pg_680" facs="0718"/>hurt our prestige. In
                        view of the fact that it has nothing whatever to do with the German treaty
                        we most earnestly urge that the Ambassador be authorized to sit in the
                        Council for the purpose of attending to these matters.</p>
                    <p>In this connection Clemenceau called my attention to the fact that the German
                        Government is getting out of hand as they believe that we might make a
                        separate peace. He has cabled Jusserand to represent to our Government [the
                        necessity of the Mission’s delaying its departure]. I have told him that for
                        practical reasons it could not be done. It is therefore all the more
                        necessary that Wallace should be empowered to sit in the Supreme Council
                        until these pending matters are completed. Otherwise we will be seriously
                        inconveniencing the Allies and will create a most unfavorable impression
                        here as they will not see the logic of our withdrawing on the 6th rather
                        than on the day the treaty was defeated. Wallace, of course, can take no
                        part in questions of the carrying out of the German treaty and the French
                        and British understand that thoroughly but [it is] only a question of
                        appearance which is important for French and Germans. There are still two
                        military missions in the field, namely General Bandholtz in Hungary and
                        General Cheney in the Baltic states. As to General Bandholtz, I have
                        proposed that the Supreme Council dissolve the Military Council in Budapest
                        immediately, but I would suggest that Bandholtz be left there as our
                        representative until Grant-Smith can arrive. As to Cheney, the work seems to
                        be [complete] and he can probably be through in a week or ten days. It would
                        create an extremely unfortunate impression to my mind to withdraw him just
                        as his work is being brought to a successful conclusion. This work is
                        connected with the Armistice and has no relation to the treaty.</p>
                    <p>As to direction that I continue to sit in the Council but refer all questions
                        to the Department, of course the Department understands that it would
                        probably be impossible to get answers to any questions I might now ask until
                        after my departure. The Commission will receive [<hi rend="italic">carry
                            out</hi>] the wishes of the Department, but, at the same time, I am sure
                        the Department would not object to the Commission completing such matters
                        [not] relating to the execution of the German treaty as are still before us.

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I feel it necessary to send
                        you a note which I received Saturday evening<note n="19" xml:id="d380fn19"
                            >November 29.</note> from the French Ambassador <pb n="681"
                            xml:id="pg_681" facs="0719"/>and which contains an earnest appeal for
                        the retention of our Commissioners in Paris and a continuance of the Supreme
                        Council.</p>
                    <p>I have given the matter careful consideration and, while I appreciate the
                        French desire to continue the Council and the validity from their standpoint
                        of some of the arguments urged, I still think that our Commissioners should
                        return as they have planned to do on December 6th.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me (and I have had the feeling for some time) that the Supreme
                        Council has been growing less and less potent in directing affairs in Europe
                        and the way its commands have recently been ignored by some of the smaller
                        nations convinces me that its usefulness is nearing, if it has not reached,
                        its end. I am sure that our Commissioners feel this, though they have not
                        said so, because they are insistent that they can do no good by remaining
                        longer.</p>
                    <p>Of course the French desire the Council to continue because, as it is now
                        constituted, M. Clemenceau practically dominates it, and is using, as far as
                        I can judge, such power as it still possesses to carry out French policies
                        in Europe which, if pursued, will be likely to cause the overthrow of the
                        present German Government, a fact which would be most unfortunate.</p>
                    <p>Everything of importance which may arise from now forward can be handled more
                        efficiently through regular diplomatic channels. At least it seems to me
                        that the close relation of the proceedings in the Senate to our activities
                        in connection with such questions as have come before the Supreme Council
                        require daily contact and knowledge of what is taking place here, and,
                        therefore, can be better guided from Washington.</p>
                    <p>The British Government have made no appeal such as the French have made, and
                        have not even intimated that they are anxious to continue the Council beyond
                        the time planned for its dissolution. Of course they may do it yet, but I am
                        sure that, if they do, it will be at the instigation of and out of
                        consideration for the French. If those two Governments had been of the same
                        mind in the matter they would certainly have addressed to us a joint appeal.
                        My own impression is that the British feel very much as we do about the
                        moribund character of the Council.</p>
                    <p>As to the effect here at home of continuing the Council I hardly need to
                        speak. I am sure though that it would do no good and might do harm. To me
                        the supreme aim is to secure a ratification of the Treaty. Anything which
                        might even remotely divert a single vote from support of the Treaty ought to
                        be avoided. Whether continuance of the Council would do that I am not sure,
                        but the very fact that I am doubtful makes me feel that we ought not to take
                        the chance of continuance, especially as there are what appear to me to be
                        other strong reasons for not doing so.</p>
                    <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0720"/>
                    <p>It seems not improbable that Germany will delay signing the protocol until
                        this country ratifies the Treaty. The thing to do, therefore, is to bend
                        every energy to that end. When that is obtained the protocol will be signed
                        and ratifications deposited, but I doubt very much if continuance of the
                        Council would have the slightest effect on the Germans no matter how long it
                        sat unless the United States ratifies.</p>
                    <p>From every American point of view I feel that it would be a serious mistake
                        to keep our Commissioners longer in Paris. I hope that you will find that
                        you can approve my views, so that I can answer the French Ambassador
                        accordingly.</p>

                        earnest desire of your Government that our Commissioners should remain in
                        Paris beyond December 6th; and I have just received a communication from him
                        returning your letter and stating that he “adheres to his original decision
                        in regard to the withdrawing of our American Commissioners.”</p>

                        advise M. Clemenceau of it.</p>

                        opinion, compel this Government to withdraw from Paris as originally
                        planned. Anything which might affect the ratification of the Peace Treaty by
                        the United States would be most unwise, and I am not alone in the belief
                        that the continuance of our Commissioners at Paris after the Senate’s action
                        at its last session would injuriously affect the plan of campaign to secure

                    <p>5517. Most urgent and confidential for the Secretary of State from Polk. In
                        connection with the German refusal to deposit ratifications and sign
                        protocol, Clemenceau made an earnest appeal to me today begging that we
                        postpone our departure. He said not only would our departure encourage the
                        Germans to stand out against the other powers, but it would be construed by
                        the French as an abandonment of the French in their hour of need. He said
                        that in his opinion it was one of the most serious crises that had
                        confronted France and begged that we stay until Germany had deposited
                        ratifications. I tried to reassure him and tried to point out that if the
                        Ambassador were charged with the power he could act for the United States,
                        but Clemenceau and the British both feel it would not be the same thing.</p>
                    <p>I have consulted my colleagues and we have come to the conclusion that there
                        is a great deal of justice in the position the French have taken and that a
                        delay of our departure of two or three days would impress the Germans with
                        our intention to stand by our Allies and at the same time give us an
                        opportunity for discussing and making up our minds what course should be
                        pursued.</p>
                    <p>Clemenceau is most insistent that I should stay until ratifications
                        deposited, but I believe that if General Bliss were charged with the duty of
                        staying here until the Germans consented to sign the protocol the French
                        people would be satisfied and the Germans would be impressed with our
                        intention to support the Allies.</p>
                    <p>I can see that the Republicans might object to our remaining here to
                        influence the Germans to accept a treaty which the Senate has refused <pb
                            n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0722"/>to ratify, but in my opinion it
                        should be put on the ground that we should stand with our Allies in
                        compelling the enemy to carry out the Armistice terms if they refuse to put
                        treaty in effect.</p>
                    <p>In view of the situation we have agreed to delay our departure until the 9th
                        unless you see serious objection. I beg, however, that in view of the strong
                        feeling on the part of the French we be permitted to remain until the 9th
                        and that you give careful consideration to the advisability of requesting
                        General Bliss to remain to represent this Government. He would have a
                        sufficient staff with the men assigned to the Embassy to do all that is
                        necessary for him. I will report fully tomorrow after a further conversation
                        with Clemenceau. Polk.</p>

                        be necessary as a result of this slight alteration in schedule. This is
                        final.</p>

                    <p>5531. Most urgent for the Secretary of State from Polk. Your 3934, December
                        1, 4 p.m. The French felt so keenly the absolute importance of our not
                        departing at this particular moment that we unanimously agreed, as I
                        telegraphed you,<note n="21" xml:id="d388fn21">No. 5517 of December 1, 10
                            p.m., <ref target="#pg_683">p. 683</ref>.</note> that our departure
                        should be delayed until the 9th so we could lay the case before you and the
                        President and get your final instructions. A delay of three days will not be
                        material as far as our movements are concerned but it seemed to be of vital
                        importance to the French. Everyone here shared their opinion that our
                        departure at this particular moment could not but have a most depressing
                        effect on the French and also encourage the Germans to refuse to sign the
                        protocol.</p>
                    <p>It was necessary to send personnel and files to the ship tonight if we were
                        sailing Saturday and therefore as a decision had to be made we decided to
                        take the responsibility of delaying our departure until Tuesday of next
                        week. We regret sincerely that this is not in accord with the views of the
                        President but as I have already told Clemenceau and the President that we
                        would delay our departure until next week it will be impossible to return to
                        our original sailing date. I would respectfully urge you again to give this
                        matter your most careful attention as I am convinced that our departure, in
                        the face of the earnest pleadings of the French, would have a most
                        disastrous effect. It may be that they exaggerated the importance of our
                        keeping a plenipotentiary here but their belief is sincere and if by chance
                        the Germans should continue to refuse to sign, nothing we could do would
                        convince the French people that they had not been abandoned in their hour of
                        need.</p>
                    <p>Clemenceau time and time again urged me to delay our hour of departure and
                        this morning when I told him that we would postpone our leaving until the
                        9th, and in the meantime take the matter up with the Department with a view
                        to seeing what arrangements could be made, he was tremendously grateful.</p>
                    <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686" facs="0724"/>
                    <p>The recommendation of the Commission is that we leave Paris on the 9th and
                        that General Bliss be directed to remain here until the Germans sign the
                        protocol. The French are most anxious that one of our Commissioners should
                        be left here for the sake of appearances, and General Bliss, while not
                        anxious to stay, feels that if the Department wishes it it is his duty to
                        remain until the Germans reach a decision. The Crillon could be shut up and
                        General and one or two officers could get quarters in some hotel and he
                        would have the services of Grew, Harrison, and the staff we are leaving at
                        the Embassy. It would be understood that he would have no duties other than
                        to watch the German situation, complete the Hungarian treaty and communicate
                        such instructions as the Department might desire to send.</p>
                    <p>I can understand there might be some embarrassment in view of the attitude of
                        the Senate but we feel that the presence of a commissioner could be
                        justified on the ground that if the Germans refuse to ratify the treaty the
                        Armistice period still exists and we would then all be practically on the
                        same footing, no treaty would exist.</p>
                    <p>I regret sincerely that we felt it necessary to delay our departure, but the
                        situation was deemed critical by all those on the ground and we felt we were
                        compelled to take that responsibility. Permit me again to urge that you look
                        at this matter in view of the new circumstances that have developed and if
                        possible arrange to have General Bliss remain unless the German attitude
                        changes before day set for our sailing. Polk.</p>

                        appreciated. I would also like to know what the situation is in regard to
                        Mexico and any other political gossip. I realize you are frightfully busy

                    <p>5554. Strictly confidential from Polk for the Secretary of State. Your
                        telegram No. 3448 [<hi rend="italic">3948</hi>] of December 3 has been
                        received. I do not believe that one can realize how strongly people here
                        feel about United States not leaving any representatives here at all after
                        our departure. It would be appreciated very much if you could give me
                        something to say to M. Clemenceau as an explanation of my taking all the
                        Commissioners away with me, as he seems to feel that we are deserting him.
                        There is a bare possibility that the Germans may be forced into line before
                        Tuesday. However, if that is not done I am afraid that our prestige will
                        suffer greatly.</p>
                    <p>No answer has been received to my telegram No. 5187 of November 14, 8 p.m. I
                        would like to urge most earnestly that Ambassador Wallace be directed to
                        represent the United States Government in Paris in the negotiations with
                        Roumania and in connection with the Hungarian treaty. All along, as you
                        know, we have taken the very strongest position regarding Roumania and the
                        United States Government was responsible in the main for the minorities
                        treaties. The principal objection on the part of the Roumanians to signing
                        the Austrian treaty rises from a wish to avoid the minorities treaty. Under
                        these circumstances I most earnestly beg that Ambassador Wallace be given
                        the duty of carrying on this unfinished business on the Supreme Council. He
                        could be limited absolutely to the work in hand and could be instructed not
                        to take any action without explicit instructions from the Department, but we
                        could say nothing which would justify our withdrawing from all of these
                        negotiations at this time. In addition the Roumanians are already making use
                        of the rumor of our withdrawal as an excuse for resisting the orders of the
                        Supreme Council.</p>
                    <pb n="689" xml:id="pg_689" facs="0727"/>
                    <p>I would also earnestly request that Wallace be permitted at least to sit in
                        the Council in connection with the deposit of the ratifications of the
                        treaty and the signing of the protocol by Germany. He could be instructed
                        not to take any part in the proceedings and not to commit the Government,
                        but his being there would have a strong moral effect both on the French
                        people and on the Germans.</p>
                    <p>The papers have announced that I sent for Baron Lersner and gave him a strong
                        talk on the necessity of his signing the treaty. Of course this is not true.
                        Actually I sent Dresel to see him and to try to impress upon him the wisdom
                        of Germany yielding to the inevitable and also to tell him that a German
                        refusal to sign would injure them with the American people.</p>
                    <p>Marshal Foch appeared before the Supreme Council this morning to discuss the
                        question of what should be done in a military way in the event of a German
                        refusal to sign the protocol. I have the impression that economic pressure
                        would be used rather than military. I believe also that the protocol can be
                        modified slightly in a way which might meet the German objections, but it
                        would have to be done, of course, in such a way as not to appear to be a
                        concession to the Germans. I would appreciate deeply such information as
                        possible regarding the procedure after our departure and I would like to
                        have the information as soon as possible as our time is so short. Polk.</p>

                    <p>3975. For Polk. Your No. 5492 of November 30, 3 a.m. In my 3906 I did not
                        mean to imply any doubt about your understanding of the Department’s
                        position and earlier instructions. It seemed important, <pb n="690"
                            xml:id="pg_690" facs="0728"/>however, in view of recent political
                        events, that the entire matter be summed up in that message.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the Rhineland Commission, Noyes will continue to act on the
                        Armistice Commission as long as it exists. A separate telegram will deal
                        with the question of funds suggested in your 5534 of December 2, 9 p.m.<note
                            n="23" xml:id="d395fn23">Not printed.</note> Please give me your opinion
                        as to whether the Armistice Commission will cease, as far as the United
                        States is concerned, at the time the treaty becomes effective or not until
                        we ratify; also as to whether Noyes and his staff could be continued at
                        Coblenz as a special commission from this Government in the occupied area,
                        during the time between the coming into force of the treaty and our
                        ratification. Pending further advice from me, please treat this latter
                        suggestion as confidential.</p>
                    <p>See my 3929 of November 29, 6 p.m.,<note n="23" xml:id="d395fn24">Not
                            printed.</note> in regard to the American member of the Rolling Stock
                        Commission and arbitrators for the allocation of river material.</p>
                    <p>If Poland and Czecho-Slovakia ask us to suggest the name of an American
                        citizen to act as chairman of the Teschen Plebiscite Commission, please give
                        me your opinion as to the qualifications and availability of Arthur Wood Du
                        Bois, who was associated with M. A. Coolidge on the Inter-Allied Teschen
                        Commission and who is now in Vienna.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the work of the Supreme Council after your departure, as you
                        already know, it does not seem advisable in the present circumstances for us
                        to continue our official representation on that body.</p>
                    <p>In regard to matters which arise under the Armistice and are not connected
                        with the carrying out of the terms of any of the treaties, our
                        representatives may continue to take part in the work of whatever bodies are
                        dealing with them. However, I suppose that in practically all instances such
                        matters will cease to be an issue as soon as the treaty becomes
                        effective.</p>
                    <p>I see no objection to carrying out your suggestion that General Bandholtz be
                        left at Budapest as our representative until the arrival of Grant-Smith.
                        What will this mean in the matter of expense and other arrangements?</p>
                    <p>I approve your suggestion that General Cheney continue to participate in the
                        work of the Baltic Mission, in view of the short time required for it to
                        finish, if his funds are sufficient.</p>
                    <p>It is not my intention to interfere with your discretion in regard to matters
                        now before the Supreme Council. I appreciate fully the desirability of
                        finishing as much of the pending business as is possible before you leave,
                        feeling sure that you have in mind the change produced in the situation by
                        the action of the Senate in regard to the treaty.</p>

                    <p>5572. Personal and confidential from Polk to the Secretary of State only. I
                        told M. Clemenceau that your decision was final and that we would all leave
                        on Tuesday night. He was very anxious to learn what arrangements had been
                        made to watch the situation in Germany and to continue unfinished business
                        such as the Hungarian treaty and the question of minorities in Roumania.</p>
                    <p>He was greatly depressed when he found that I could give him no answer. He
                        said that it appeared as if France were being abandoned.</p>
                    <p>It is now known generally that we are leaving on Tuesday and there is bitter
                        criticism of the United States both here and in England. It is said that it
                        is impossible to rely on the United States and some of our best friends here
                        believe that even if the treaty is passed the withdrawal of the United
                        States at this time will seriously affect our influence in the League of
                        Nations. I still hope to hear that Ambassador Wallace can be given at least
                        limited powers in connection with the unfinished work. Polk.</p>

                    <p>3985. From the Secretary for Polk. Your telegram No. 5554 of December 4th,
                        midnight.</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>(1)</label>
                        <item>In case you consider it necessary that Clemenceau be given any
                            explanation of the withdrawal of the American Peace Commissioners you
                            might intimate discreetly that the political situation in the United
                            States does not allow the continuation of what is looked upon as an
                            unjustifiably prolonged dictatorship of European affairs by the Supreme
                            Council, for whose activities the American representative thereon must
                            assume a full share of responsibility. Public opinion in the United
                            States at present is against further American participation in and
                            responsibility for the settlement of political questions which are
                            largely subjects of European concern. In addition the recent action of
                            the Senate in regard to the treaty with Germany renders acts of the
                            American representative on the Supreme Council open to repudiation at
                            any time, and the Department does <pb n="692" xml:id="pg_692"
                                facs="0730"/>not desire to have the American representative placed
                            in such a position.</item>
                        <label>(2)</label>
                        <item>Also see my telegram 3975 of December 5th, 1 p.m. Ambassador Wallace
                            will be instructed by the Department to endeavor to keep in touch with
                            the proceedings of coming meetings of the Supreme Council through his
                            colleagues in an informal way in order that the Department may be kept
                            informed of the nature of the questions being discussed. All political
                            questions which would require an expression of opinion on the part of
                            the United States Government, however, would have to be taken up through
                            the ordinary diplomatic channels. Ambassador Wallace in case of absolute
                            necessity could be designated as representative of the United States in
                            the negotiation of treaties with Roumania and Hungary. Such a step
                            should not, however, be construed as an admission by the United States
                            that this Government continues to be represented on the Supreme
                            Council.</item>
                        <label>(3)</label>
                        <item>The United States Government cannot be a signatory to the protocol.
                            Wallace, therefore, should not attend either the ratification of the
                            treaty or the signing of the protocol.</item>
                        <label>[(4)]</label>
                        <item>The following is for your confidential information. While I am
                            entirely aware of the situation which is produced by the apparent
                            unwillingness of the Germans to sign the protocol, I am confident that,
                            if certain modifications could be made in some of the sections of the
                            protocol, an agreement might be reached satisfactory to all concerned.
                            As you were informed recently by the Department’s telegram No. 3663 of
                            November 4, 3 p.m., United States Government does not regard as good
                            policy, in the circumstances, the demand for civilian material such as
                            docks, cranes etc., as reparation for the destruction of enemy warships.
                            Also the Department does not consider that sanctions as extensive as
                            those provided for in the last paragraph of the protocol are essential
                            since the sanctions already provided for in the treaty of Versailles
                            (such as commissions of control, armies of occupation, etc.) are
                            sufficient to cover all demands. This is only another of the numerous
                            instances by which resentment has been aroused in Germany by the
                            imposition of an unnecessary condition which through its general terms
                            could be used as an excuse for any subsequent action against
                            Germany.</item>

                            you should not commit the United States Government to any coercive

                    <p>5592. Strictly confidential and personal from Polk for the Secretary of State
                        only. To be delivered to the Secretary’s residence at once.</p>
                    <p>Your telegram No. 3975 of December 5. In a later telegram I will let you know
                        about the Rhine Commission, the Teschen Committee, and the matter of funds
                        for Bandholtz. I know how very busy you are and how many trying and
                        irritating questions are now before you and I therefore hesitate to add
                        another worry, but I hope at the same time that you will forgive me if I
                        urge upon you again the necessity of having someone finish the work before
                        the Supreme Council which will still be pending on the day of our departure.
                        We will be in the position of carrying on our work up to an arbitrary day
                        and then abruptly taking our departure, thus leaving the other four powers
                        to continue with no representative of the United States on the work which we
                        have been engaged in preparing.</p>
                    <p>You already have my views with regard to Germany and also in regard to the
                        minorities treaty, the Austrian treaty, and the Hungarian treaty. But I must
                        again ask you to consider the position we are placing ourselves in by not
                        bringing to a conclusion our uncompleted task. Inasmuch as we have been
                        largely instrumental in the framing of the Hungarian treaty and in making it
                        possible for the Hungarians to form a Government, I am unable to see how the
                        Senate or anyone could have an objection to our being present when the
                        treaty is presented, provided the decision of the Senate is not to be
                        considered as final. The same is true of the Roumanian minorities treaty.
                        The powers have given Roumania an ultimatum and it appears to me that there
                        could be no criticism of our standing by until the Roumanian minorities
                        treaty is signed, particularly as minorities treaties were imposed on the
                        Poles, Serbs, and Greeks. Neither the Roumanian treaty nor the Hungarian
                        treaty would require Ambassador Wallace to exercise any discretion as all
                        the details have been completed.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the German protocol, personally I think Germany will sign, but
                        nothing can convince the French that we have not deserted them in an
                        emergency if we leave while the negotiations are still going on. In this
                        matter also it seems to me that the Senate could have no objection to our
                        sitting in the conference, for, in the event that the Germans refuse to
                        sign, it would be only fair that the other powers should know what position,
                        if any, we intend to take under the terms of the Armistice. I believe it is
                        thoroughly understood by the powers that it is only the Supreme Council as
                        such that can function in connection <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694" facs="0732"
                        />with these matters and that it would be quite easy to impress on them that
                        the Ambassadors would have to refer to their governments for
                        instructions.</p>
                    <p>We are leaving Tuesday evening at 8 o’clock and M. Clemenceau is still hoping
                        that something can be done to avoid the appearance of our leaving
                        arbitrarily. I believe that he is disturbed not only because of the possible
                        effect of our departure on Germany, but he also sees that our withdrawal
                        practically throws the European situation into the hands of Great Britain
                        which would be the only power strong enough to assume leadership.</p>
                    <p>Permit me to apologize again for being so persistent, but from every side,
                        from the French, British and Americans I get the impression that this is one
                        of the critical moments in American diplomatic history and on your decision,
                        to a great extent, rests the prestige of the United States. People like
                            Grasty<note n="24" xml:id="d398fn24">C. H. Grasty, representative of the
                                <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>.</note> are urging that I
                        present this point of view to you for they cannot see what our position will
                        be like on Wednesday when business will have to be done and no one will be
                        here to represent us although we have been represented on the previous day.
                        The question is why should we alter our position by leaving on Tuesday
                        night, especially as the business we would have been discussing on Tuesday
                        morning would still be unfinished.</p>
                    <p>I apologize again for bothering you, but we are in an embarrassing position.
                        Polk.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: In view of the insistence of
                        Mr. Polk in the enclosed message (No. 5592),<note n="25" xml:id="d399fn25"

                        sections, I feel that I should lay before you for immediate decision the
                        question of dealing with the present critical situation in Paris as a result
                        of the withdrawal of our Commissioners and the failure of the Germans to
                        sign the protocol.</p>
                    <p>I have considered the subject with sympathetic appreciation of the French
                        attitude toward our withdrawal and at the same time with a realization that
                        to continue a representative on the Supreme Council in view of the Senate’s
                        action would be to relieve that body of a responsibility which they ought to
                        bear and which will become all the more evident if we do not proceed as if
                        they had not rejected ratification.</p>
                    <pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695" facs="0733"/>
                    <p>To me the latter course seems much the more important and the European press
                        as well as the American press is beginning to blame the Senate, as it should
                        do, for the present situation. To Mr. Polk, on the other hand, the
                        importunity and arguments of the French seem of first importance, and he
                        suggests a means of meeting their wishes. While we thus differ as to the
                        essential factor in deciding the problem, I am in a measure willing, if it
                        meets your views, to go part way in relieving French anxiety, provided it
                        can be done without removing the blame which today rests upon the Republican
                        Senators for the present situation.</p>
                    <p>I suggest two possible methods of handling the problem: <list>
                            <item>First: To direct Ambassador Wallace to sit in on the Supreme
                                Council as an observer and not as a participant, and to instruct him
                                to take no action and to express no opinion on any subject
                                discussed; to report the proceedings to Washington and await
                                instructions; and to issue to him full powers to sign the Hungarian
                                and Roumanian (minority) treaties.</item>
                            <item>Second: For me to ask a hearing before the Foreign Relations
                                Committee or interview with Senator Lodge, lay the whole situation
                                before them, and say to them frankly that the Senate’s action has
                                placed us in this dilemma and that, therefore, they should decide
                                whether or not we should continue to co-operate with the Allies in
                                having even a silent representative on the Supreme Council.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Personally I do not favor either suggestion, but, if either is to be adopted,
                        the first seems to be the better because I do not like the idea of even
                        indirectly giving the impression that the Senate has the right to control in
                        any way our foreign affairs except as to its constitutional power in
                        relation to treaties. I think that the principle outweighs the expediency of
                        forcing the Republican majority to express an opinion as to the wisdom of
                        retaining an inactive member on the Supreme Council. It would of course
                        seriously embarrass them; but, on the other hand, if they favor such
                        representation, they would be relieved in part at least from the tide of
                        public complaint and criticism which is constantly growing higher as the
                        consequences of their failure to ratify the treaty become more apparent to
                        everybody.</p>
                    <p>As our Commissioners leave Paris Tuesday night, I think this matter should be
                        settled immediately; otherwise it will be too late to communicate with Mr.
                        Polk before his departure, and he ought to be able, before leaving, to tell
                        the French what we intend to do.</p>
                    <p>I would like also to have your decision as to whether our troops in the
                        Rhineland should take part in the reported operations instituted by Foch to
                        force Germany to sign the protocol. As the protocol has to do in fact with
                        the deposit of ratifications, should we permit our men to participate in the
                        present coercive measures? And yet, since it may be claimed that the sinking
                        of the German ships at Scapa Flow was a violation of the armistice and the
                        protocol was drawn <pb n="696" xml:id="pg_696" facs="0734"/>to recompense
                        the Allies for the loss due to the violation, the failure to permit our
                        troops to be used might be open to criticism. I never liked the terms of the
                        protocol, but as it was agreed to by the Supreme Council I do not see how we
                        can reopen the case on the merits. I confess that I do not blame the German
                        Government for doing so. The only thing is how far ought we to go in
                        allowing our armed forces to be used in compelling the Germans to
                        submit.</p>
                    <p>Viewed strategically the longer the protocol remains unsigned by Germany so
                        much the more blame will be put on the Senate and so much the more pressure
                        will be put on that body to ratify the Treaty.</p>
                    <p>As the newspapers are announcing, on what authority or information I do not
                        know, that our troops are participating in Foch’s movement across the Rhine,
                        I think that a decision in this matter ought to be reached without
                        delay.</p>
                    <p>Faithfully yours,</p>

                        plan you suggest (no. one) of having Ambassador Wallace sit in etc. he is
                        willing to adopt.</p>
                    <p>Then, in regard to the matter of our troops in the Rhineland, the President
                        says he will leave that to Gen. Bliss—and make his judgment concerning it,
                        his own.</p>
                    <p>I am returning your letter that you may have it for reference—also Mr. Polk’s
                        cable.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your message to the President. He is gaining every day now.
                        Please remember us both to Mrs. Lansing.</p>

                        being instructed to take no action and to express no opinion on any subjects
                        which may be discussed but to report the proceedings to Washington and to
                        await instructions. The Department is likewise giving to Ambassador Wallace
                        full powers to sign the Roumanian minorities treaty and the Hungarian
                        treaty. Ambassadors Grey and Jusserand have been informed of the above.</p>

                        following message from me?</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>“My dear Mr. President: At the moment when after more than a year of
                            continuous labor the American Mission to Negotiate Peace is taking its
                            departure from Paris I desire to extend to you and through you to the
                            people of France a personal message of thanks for the unfailing courtesy
                            that has been shown the American representatives in your country.
                            Throughout the many months of difficult and delicate negotiations in
                            which our representatives participated your constant hospitality and
                            generous spirit has been a source of profound gratification to me. It is
                            my earnest hope that the peace for which we have worked together shall
                            soon have been attained, and the world restored to the blessings of the
                            normal state which it so sorely needs. Peace alone can mend the ravages
                            of the past five years, and satisfy the yearnings of the men and women
                            everywhere whose bodies and souls have been so heavily burdened. I am
                            convinced that with the fruits of peace will come an even closer measure
                            of cooperation between our peoples, and that our bond of friendship,
                            sanctified by common sacrifice, will become still more closely united to
                            meet the problems of the future. Faithfully yours, Robert Lansing.”</p>

                        been well done.</p>

                    <p>5601. Strictly confidential from Polk for the Secretary of State only. Your
                        telegram No. 3985 of December 6 has just been received. In order that I may
                        make the situation entirely clear, I think I should let you know that I
                        never had any idea that the Supreme Council should be continued for any
                        other purposes than those which I indicated in my personal telegrams to you.
                        All along I have been in favor of winding up the Supreme Council. It is my
                        idea also that Ambassador Wallace should have no authority to act in any way
                        except on direct instructions from the Department in each case and that all
                        political questions of every nature should be taken up with the United
                        States Government through the State Department. You agreed that in case of
                        absolute necessity Ambassador Wallace might be designated to represent the
                        United States in the negotiations of treaties with Roumania and Hungary. I
                        thought it would be better if the powers could be given to understand before
                        our departure that he was authorized to act for the United States. It was
                        also entirely clear in my mind that his presence for this purpose should not
                        be regarded as a continuation of American representation on the Supreme
                        Council for any other purpose.</p>
                    <p>In regard to paragraph 3, I quite agree that the United States should not be
                        signatory to the protocol although it would be within our right and it was
                        never our intention that the United States delegation should be present at
                        the signing of the protocol or at the first meeting of the League of

                    <p>I think I have been successful in having the British modify the reparation
                        clause on Scapa Flow by referring to the reparation committee for final
                        decision the objection raised by Germany that the delivery of material would
                        cripple it commercially. This ought to meet the German objections.</p>
                    <p>The last paragraph of the protocol has now been modified in such a way as to
                        meet your views. The note in reply to the German note is also being further
                        modified in a way of which I am sure you will approve.</p>

                    <p>In case the Germans refuse to sign the protocol it had already been
                        understood that the United States could not be committed to any coercive
                        measures of a military or economic character without specific orders from
                        the President.</p>
                    <p>The point which I have been trying to make was that if Ambassador Wallace
                        should receive some instructions before our departure, he would be in a
                        position to represent the United States in connection with the Roumanian and
                        Hungarian treaties without his having to wait in order to refer the matter
                        to the Department which takes a long time. His power would amount to
                        nothing, but the matter that has disturbed us is the question of
                        appearances. Polk.</p>

                    <p>1736. From Polk. Your 3997, December 8th. Most grateful for your decision.
                        Wallace awaiting instructions. Clemenceau and French perfectly satisfied for
                        the moment. Fortunately the Roumanians are signing the Austrian, Bulgarian
                        and minorities treaties today. Hungarian treaty complete, German note
                        presented and have reason to believe from what Lersner told Dresel today
                        that they will sign. These extra four days have been of great value. Went
                        over all subjects not disposed of and practically everything referred to
                        State Department for decision. We leave Paris tonight. Looking forward to
                        seeing you and apologizing for all the trouble I have given you the last
                        three or four days.</p>
                    <p>Clemenceau going to London to discuss situation resulting from our failure to
                        ratify and to arrange details in regard to ratification of treaties.</p>

                        State was about to leave France.<note n="26" xml:id="d409fn26">For this
