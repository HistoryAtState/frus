                <p>The Department of State released today <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the
                        United States</hi>, 1969–1976, Volume E–16, Documents on Chile, 1969–1973.
                    This volume is part of a Foreign Relations subseries that documents the most
                    important foreign policy issues of the Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford
                    presidential administrations. The volume documents U.S. policy toward Chile from
                    January 1969 to September 24, 1973, when the Nixon administration announced its
                    extension of diplomatic recognition to the military junta under General Augusto
                    Pinochet. It is an online-only supplement to <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi>, 1969–1976, Volume XXI, Chile, 1969–1973, and should be read
                    in conjunction with that volume, as well with the upcoming <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi>, 1969–1976, Volume E–11, Part 2, Documents on South
                    America, 1973–1976. </p>
                <p>The primary focus of Volume E–16 is on the attitudes adopted and actions taken by
                    the U.S. Government toward the installation of two successive Chilean
                    presidents: the election and inauguration of Salvador Allende in September 1970
                    and the military coup d’état of General Augusto Pinochet in September 1973. In
                    contrast to the printed volume, this supplement includes a selection of
                    Presidential tape recordings, as transcribed by the editors, which add context
                    and detail to formal records on President Nixon’s posture toward President
                    Allende, as well as several documents on human rights violations in the
                    aftermath of the Pinochet coup d’état. </p>

                <p>This volume was compiled and edited by James McElveen and James Siekmeier , and

                <head>Preface</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of
                    the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of
                    the General Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of
                    State Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific
                    standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26,
                    1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, established a new
                    statutory charter for the preparation of the series which was signed by
                    President George H.W. Bush on October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138
                    added a new Title IV to the Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956
                    (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the
                    principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than
                    30 years after the events recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume
                    meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and
                    editing.</p>

                <p>The primary focus of this volume is on the attitudes adopted and actions taken by
                    the U.S. Government toward the installation of two successive Chilean
                    presidents: the election and inauguration of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                        >Salvador Allende</persName> in September 1970 and the military coup d’état
                    of General <persName corresp="#p_PUA_1">Augusto Pinochet</persName> in September
                    1973. This volume differs from most volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series, however, in two important ways. First, many of the
                    documents herein have been thoroughly examined, summarized, and declassified in
                    several other public projects, in particular: the reports released in the
                    mid-1970s by the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with
                    Respect to Intelligence Activities (the Church Committee); and the documents
                    released in the late-1990s by the Chile Declassification Project (the <persName
                        corresp="#p_PUA_1">Pinochet</persName> Project). The editors of this volume,
                    while acknowledging what has been released before, have tried to meet the
                    series’ standard of thoroughness, accuracy, and reliability not only by adding
                    to the historical record but also by presenting a complete documentary account,
                    regardless of previous declassification. Second, recognizing both the importance
                    of the subject and the nature of the documentation, the editors also compiled
                    this extensive electronic supplement to go along with the printed volume (<ref

                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1969–1976, Volume XXI, Chile,
                        1969–1973</ref>). This supplement includes a selection of Presidential tape
                    recordings, as transcribed by the editors, which adds context and detail to
                    formal records on President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>’s
                    posture toward President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>; and
                    several documents on human rights in the aftermath of the <persName
                        corresp="#p_PUA_1">Pinochet</persName> coup d’état, in particular, the
                    disappearance and death of two U.S. citizens, <persName corresp="#p_HC_1"
                        >Charles Horman</persName> and Frank Teruggi. In the latter instance,
                    although <persName corresp="#p_HC_1">Horman</persName> and Teruggi both died
                    before September 24, the investigation into the circumstances surrounding these
                    two tragic <pb n="V" facs="0006" xml:id="pg_V"/>cases—and the resulting public
                    controversy—continued long afterwards. Additional documentation, therefore, is
                    scheduled for publication in the subsequent compilation on Chile in <ref

                <p>Although organized into five chapters, this volume is perhaps best surveyed in
                    terms of three periods in <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                    political career: before his election on September 4, 1970; between his election
                    and inauguration on November 4, 1970; and after his inauguration until his
                    overthrow and death on September 11, 1973. The first period also corresponds to
                    the final two years of the administration of President <persName
                        corresp="#p_FME_1">Eduardo Frei</persName>, which, in terms of U.S. policy,
                    continued largely along lines established during his first four years in office.
                        <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName>, for instance, received
                    substantial political and economic support, including covert assistance during
                    the 1964 election from the <persName corresp="#p_KRT_1">Kennedy</persName> and
                        <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName> administrations. Since the
                    deliberations on whether to provide similar assistance to any of the major
                    candidates in the 1970 election were heavily influenced by the decision-making
                    process six years earlier, as well as by political developments in the
                    intervening years, readers should consult the compilation on Chile in <ref

                        >Allende</persName>’s narrow victory in the 1970 election represented a
                    decisive break in this continuity, a break that is clearly represented in the
                    pace of documentation, as the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                    administration sought to block <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                    confirmation and inauguration. The second period, covering these intervening two
                    months, documents day-to-day decisions in a series of meetings, memoranda, and
                    backchannel messages on attempting to block <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                        >Allende</persName>’s confirmation, either by constitutional means or by
                    military coup d’état, respectively. The third period, which picks up the story
                    after <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s inauguration,
                    demonstrates how the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                    administration adopted and implemented its “cool and correct” policy to
                    destabilize the Chilean Government while simultaneously strengthening ties with
                    the Chilean military. This policy was largely determined less through covert
                    operations and more through the formal interagency process on economic affairs,
                    including discouraging favorable terms in international lending and foreign
                    assistance to Chile, while encouraging a favorable settlement in the
                    nationalization of copper and other Chilean industries, previously dominated by
                    U.S. multinational corporations. The volume concludes with the events of
                    September 1973: the coup d’état under General <persName corresp="#p_PUA_1"
                        >Pinochet</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                    suicide, and U.S. diplomatic recognition of the military junta.</p>

                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the <pb n="VI" facs="0007"
                        xml:id="pg_VI"/>time and date of the conversation, rather than the date the
                    memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The documents
                    are reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents
                    within the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the
                    editors for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
                    punctuation are retained as found in the original text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the
                    documents are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic
                    type; an addition in roman type. Words repeated in telegrams to avoid garbling
                    or provide emphasis are silently corrected. Words or phrases underlined in the
                    source text are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved
                    as found in the original text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the
                    front matter of each volume. In telegrams, the telegram number (including
                    special designators such as Secto) is printed at the start of the text of the
                    telegram.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount and, where possible, the
                    nature of the material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for
                    declassification purposes have been accounted for and are listed with headings,
                    source notes, and number of pages not declassified in their chronological place.
                    All brackets that appear in the original text are so identified in
                    footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the source of the document,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>

                    Review</p>
                <p>Under the terms of the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act
                    (PRMPA) of 1974 (44 USC 2111 note), the National Archives and Records
                    Administration (<gloss target="#t_NARA_1">NARA</gloss>) has custody of the Nixon
                    Presidential historical materials. The requirements of the PRMPA and
                    implementing regulations govern access to the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                        >Nixon</persName> Presidential historical materials. The PRMPA and
                    implementing public access regulations require <gloss target="#t_NARA_1"
                        >NARA</gloss> to review for additional restrictions in order to ensure the
                    protection of the privacy rights of former Nixon White House officials, since
                    these officials were not given the opportunity to separate their personal
                    materials from public papers. Thus, the PRMPA and implementing public access
                    regulations require <gloss target="#t_NARA_1">NARA</gloss> formally to notify
                    the Nixon estate and former Nixon White House staff members that the agency is
                    scheduling for public release Nixon White House historical materials. The

                    staff members have 30 days to contest the release of Nixon historical materials
                    in which they were a participant or are mentioned. Further, the PRMPA and
                    implementing regulations require <gloss target="#t_NARA_1">NARA</gloss> to
                    segregate and return to the creator of files private and personal materials. All
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes that include materials from

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Nixon White House Tapes</p>
                <p>Access to the Nixon White House tape recordings is governed by the terms of the
                    PRMPA and an access agreement with the Office of Presidential Libraries of the
                    National Archives and Records Administration and the Nixon Estate. In February
                    1971, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> initiated a voice
                    activated taping system in the Oval Office of the White House and, subsequently,
                    in the President’s Office in the Executive Of<pb n=" VIII" facs="0009"
                        xml:id="pg_VIII"/>fice Building, Camp David, the Cabinet Room, and White
                    House and Camp David telephones. The audiotapes include conversations of
                    President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> with his Assistant for
                    National Security Affairs, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry
                        Kissinger</persName>, other White House aides, Secretary of State <persName
                        corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>, other Cabinet officers, members of
                    Congress, and key foreign officials. The clarity of the voices on the tape
                    recordings is often very poor, but the editor has made every effort to verify
                    the accuracy of the transcripts produced here. Readers are advised that the tape
                    recording is the official document; the transcript represents an interpretation
                    of that document. Through the use of digital audio and other advances in
                    technology, the Office of the Historian has been able to enhance the tape
                    recordings and over time produce more accurate transcripts. The result is that
                    some transcripts printed here may differ from transcripts of the same
                    conversations printed in previous <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    volumes. The most accurate transcripts possible, however, cannot substitute for
                    listening to the recordings. Readers are urged to consult the recordings
                    themselves for a full appreciation of those aspects of the conversations that
                    cannot be captured in a transcript, such as the speakers’ inflections and
                    emphases that may convey nuances of meaning, as well as the larger context of
                    the discussion.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 13526, as amended, on Classified
                    National Security Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments. The
                    declassification review of this volume, which began in 2000 and was completed in
                    2013 resulted in the decision to withhold 0 documents in full, excisions of a
                    paragraph or more in 35 documents, and minor excisions of less than a paragraph
                    in 15 documents.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the record presented in this volume presented here
                    provides an accurate and comprehensive account of U.S. foreign policy on
                    Chile.</p>

                <p>James McElveen and James Siekmeier collected the documents, made the selections,
                    and annotated them under the direct supervision of successive chiefs of the Asia

                    direction of two successive General Editors, David S. Patterson and Edward C.
                    Keefer. Susan Weetman, Carl Ashley, and Dean Weatherhead coordinated the
                    declassification review. David Geyer assumed responsibility for resolving
                    substantive issues of compilation and review during the final stages of
                    production. Kristen Ahlberg, Mandy A. Chalou, Keri Lewis, Heather McDaniel, and
                    Rita Baker performed the copy and technical editing.</p>

                    Series</p>
                <p>The 1991 <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the
                    published record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include
                    all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation on major U.S. foreign
                    policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires
                    that government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                    engaged in foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the
                    Department of State Historian by providing full and complete access to records
                    pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of
                    selected records. Most of the sources consulted in the preparation of this
                    volume have been declassified and are available for review at the National
                    Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between
                    the President and Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the files of
                    overseas diplomatic posts. All the Department’s indexed central files through
                    July 1973 have been permanently transferred to the National Archives and Records
                    Administration at College Park, Maryland (Archives II). Many of the Department’s
                    decentralized office files covering the 1969–1976 period, which the National
                    Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred or are in
                    the process of being transferred from the Department’s custody to Archives
                    II.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also have full
                    access to the papers of Presidents <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                    and Ford as well as other White House foreign policy records. Presidential
                    papers maintained and preserved at the Presidential libraries include some of
                    the most significant foreign affairs-related documentation from the Department
                    of State and other Federal agencies including the National Security Council, the
                    Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry Kissinger</persName> has approved
                    access to his papers at the Library of Congress. These papers are a key source
                    for the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>-Ford subseries of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series.</p>
                <pb n="XIV" facs="0015" xml:id="pg_XIV"/>
                <p>Research for this volume was completed through special access to restricted
                    documents at the Nixon Presidential Materials Project, the Ford Presidential
                    Library, the Library of Congress, and other agencies. While all the material
                    printed in this volume has been declassified, some of it is extracted from still
                    classified documents. In the time since the research for this volume was
                    completed, the Nixon Presidential Materials have been transferred to the Nixon
                    Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California. The Nixon
                    Presidential Library staff is processing and declassifying many of the documents
                    used in this volume, but they may not be available in their entirety at the time
                    of publication.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources for <hi rend="roman">Foreign Relations</hi>,
                    1969–1976, Volume E–16</p>
                <p>In preparing this volume, the editors thoroughly mined the Presidential Papers
                    and other White House records from the Nixon Presidential Materials Project at
                    the National Archives. This research was conducted when the project was still
                    housed at the facility in College Park (Archives II); both the project and the
                    collection were subsequently moved in 2010 to its permanent home at the Nixon
                    Presidential Library in Yorba Linda. Whether in Maryland or California, these
                    materials proved the most valuable source of documentation on the <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> administration’s conduct of relations
                    with Chile. Some of the most important records for this volume were found in the
                    National Security Council Files, in particular, the Country Files on Chile.
                    These files document basic day-to-day decision making within the White House and
                    National Security Council staff, including memoranda to <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                        >Nixon</persName>, records of meetings, copies of telegrams, and backchannel
                    messages. Two folders within the National Security Files are also worth
                    mentioning here with similar, if more specialized, documentation: one, entitled
                        <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> File, is part of the Country
                    Files on Chile; and the other, entitled Chile Wrap and Post-Mortem, is part of
                    the Country Files in the <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                    Office Files. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> played a
                    central role in U.S.-Chilean relations—particularly during the pivotal events of
                    September and October 1970 (between <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                        >Allende</persName>’s election and subsequent inauguration as
                    President)—until <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>’s replacement in
                    October 1971. His lengthy backchannel messages are not only concentrated in the
                    sources cited above but also scattered throughout other repositories. In the
                    midst of other, more bureaucratic, documents, these “‘Korrygrams,” as they were
                    called at the time, are as entertaining to read as they are essential for
                    following developments in Chile on a daily basis.</p>
                <p>The formal policy-making process on Chile is documented in the National Security
                    Files (H-Files) at the Nixon Library. These files contain minutes, memoranda,
                    and related documentation on the deliberations of the National Security Council
                    itself, the Senior Review Group, the Washington Special Actions Group, and other
                    interagency com<pb n="XV" facs="0016" xml:id="pg_XV"/>mittees; also included are
                    records relating to National Security Council Study and Decision Memoranda
                        (<gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss>s and <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1"
                        >NSDM</gloss>s), as well as similar decision-making documents. The H-Files
                    are most useful in documenting interagency discussions on Chile, either before
                        <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s election in September 1970
                    or after his inauguration in November 1970. Rather than rely on formal decision
                    papers, <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> made many decisions on Chile outside
                    normal bureaucratic channels, in particular, through a series of one-on-meetings
                    and telephone conversations. The editors, therefore, consulted two other crucial
                    sources: the <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> Telephone
                    Conversation Transcripts; and the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                    White House Tape Recordings. The <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                        >Kissinger</persName> transcripts provide a rare glimpse into the role
                    played by the President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs in regard to
                    Chile, in particular, before <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                    inauguration but also at the time of his overthrow in September 1973. Installed
                    in February 1971 and removed in July 1973, the White House taping system was
                    unfortunately not in operation during either period. The <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> tapes, nonetheless, include a number of
                    important deliberations on Chile, notably on <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                        >Nixon</persName>’s policy to adopt a “cool and correct” posture in
                    relations with <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>; transcripts of
                    these conversations, as transcribed by the editors, are printed in this online
                    supplement.</p>
                <p>Given the level of U.S. involvement in Chilean political affairs during the
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> administration, intelligence
                    records were essential in compiling this volume. The editors had access to the
                    records at the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the
                    Department of State, and the Department of Defense. The Nixon Intelligence Files
                    at the National Security Council constitute the most authoritative record of the
                    meetings of the 303 Committee and its successor, the 40 Committee, which were
                    responsible for decisions on covert operations. The files of the Central
                    Intelligence Agency, particularly the National Intelligence Council Registry of
                        <gloss target="#t_NIE_1">NIE</gloss>s and <gloss target="#t_SNIE_1"
                        >SNIE</gloss>s (Job 79R01012A), were essential for intelligence reports and
                    assessments on which the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                    administration based its policy decisions. Although many of its most important
                    records on covert operations were also found in other repositories, several
                    collections (or “Jobs”) were invaluable at the Central Intelligence Agency,
                    including the 1970 Chile Task Force files (Job 80–00012A) and the White House
                    Correspondence Files on Chile (Job 80B01086A). The Bureau of Intelligence and
                    Research in the Department of State was also an active participant on
                    intelligence matters, whether in assessing developments in Chile or in
                    developing options for U.S. policymakers. The “historical files” of the Bureau’s
                    Office of Intelligence Coordination (<gloss target="#t_INRIL_1">INR/IL</gloss>)
                    and the files of <persName corresp="#p_GJR_1">James Gardner</persName>, who
                    served first as Deputy Director for Coordination and then as Chief of the
                    Operations Policy Staff, were particularly useful in this regard, notably the
                    memoranda of regular <gloss target="#t_ARA_1">ARA</gloss>/<gloss
                        target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> meetings on intelligence.</p>
                <pb n="XVI" facs="0017" xml:id="pg_XVI"/>
                <p>U.S. involvement in Chile was the subject of several congressional investigations
                    in the 1970s, most notably two chaired by Senator <persName corresp="#p_CF_1"
                        >Frank Church</persName> (D-Idaho), the Senate Select Committee to Study
                    Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, which
                    investigated U.S. covert operations in Chile, and the Subcommittee on
                    Multinational Corporations, which investigated allegations against the
                    involvement of the International Telegraph and Telephone Company (<gloss
                        target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss>) in Chile; and the House Select Committee on
                    Intelligence, chaired by Congressman Otis Pike (D-New York). Materials related
                    to these investigations, including copies of the original documents collected,
                    were found in at least two archival sources. The most valuable of these was a
                    retired Department of State office or “lot” file, 81D121, held for reference
                    purposes in the Foreign Affairs Information Management Center (as it was called
                    at the time) until its transferal to the National Archives in 2004 as part of
                    Record Group 59 (<gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59). Since the
                    investigations largely took place during the Ford administration, the records
                    held at the Ford Presidential Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan, are also useful,
                    in particular, the Intelligence Subject File in the collection of Philip Buchen,
                    who served as Counsel to the President.</p>
                <p>As important as covert operations in Chile may have been, however, the United
                    States still conducted most of its Chilean policy through normal channels of
                    diplomacy, in particular, through the Department of State. This role is well
                    reflected in the Department’s records, including the central and retired lot
                    files (both <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59) accessioned and maintained at
                    the National Archives. A number of records in the central files’ subject numeric
                    system were useful, including those filed under POL 7 CHILE (visits and meetings
                    concerning Chile), POL 14 CHILE (elections in Chile), POL 15 CHILE (Chilean
                    government), POL CHILE–US (relations between Chile and the United States), and
                    POL 1 CHILE–US (general policy and background on relations between Chile and the
                    United States); INCO COPPER CHILE (copper in Chile), and INCO 15–2 CHILE
                    (nationalization/expropriation in Chile). Starting in January 1973, the
                    Department of State switched its central files to an electronic system; the
                    telegrams for 1973 are available online in the Access to Archival Databases on
                    the National Archives website.</p>
                <p>The <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> Papers at the Library of
                    Congress largely replicate documentation found in other collections. Since this
                    volume was compiled, copies of the most important original source—the <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> Telephone Conversation Transcripts
                    (see above)—were initially deposited at the Nixon Presidential Materials
                    Project; they were then relocated to the Nixon Presidential Library in 2010.
                    Although the citations in this volume refer to the <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                        >Kissinger</persName> Papers, copies of the transcripts as organized in the
                    original collection are available to the public at the Nixon Presidential
                    Library.</p>

                <p>The following list identifies the particular files and collections used in the
                    preparation of the volume. The declassification and transfer to the National
                    Archives of the Department of State records is in process, and many of these
                    records are already available for public review at the National Archives.</p>

                    certainly was a natural choice but it was assigned this function at least in
                    part because the Agency controlled unvouchered funds, by which operations could

                <p>During the Korean conflict the OPC grew quickly. Wartime commitments and other

                        <p>A. Over the past four years the administration of <persName
                                corresp="#p_FME_1">Eduardo Frei</persName> has been endeavoring to
                            carry out a social, economic, and political revolution by peaceful,
                            constitutional means. He has made considerable progress in some
                            important fields, but in others has fallen far short of his goals. An
                            important faction of his Christian Democratic Party (<gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>) is insisting that the scope of reform
                            be widened and its tempo quickened.</p>
                        <p>B. Economic prospects for the short run are bleak, and we see little
                            chance for much further progress on basic problems over the next year or
                            so. There are a few favorable aspects, notably the new US investments
                            under the copper expansion agreement and the likely continuation of
                            substantial foreign assistance over the next year. But the <persName
                                corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName> administration is already caught
                            in a quandary of economic stagnation with rapid inflation. As the
                            elections approach, pressures for government spending on wages and
                            welfare will almost certainly intensify, and business confidence will
                            probably reach a new low.</p>
                        <p>C. The outcome of the congressional elections of March 1969 will have an
                            important bearing on the selection of candidates and the formation of
                            political coalitions for the presidential election in 1970. The <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> has some chance of winning a majority
                            in the Senate and is likely to retain a sizable plurality in the lower
                            house. Nonetheless, factionalism within the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss>, the maneuvering of other parties for political
                            advantage in the 1970 election, and <persName corresp="#p_FME_1"
                                >Frei</persName>’s lameduck status will weaken his influence over
                            the new Congress.</p>
                        <p>D. Until the final choice of candidates and of political party alignments
                            is made, it is not feasible to attempt to estimate the outcome of the
                            presidential election in more than the most general terms. Among many
                            possible outcomes, the current odds are that there will be three major
                            candidates for the presidency in 1970, that no one of them will secure a
                            majority, and that the Congress will select as president the candidate
                            with the largest vote. If the Communist, Socialist, and Radical parties
                            could set aside their differences to agree on a candidate, he would be a
                            strong contender, especially in a three-man race.</p>
                        <p>E. Even if a Communist-supported candidate won in 1970 we do not believe
                            that the Chilean Armed Forces would intervene to prevent his
                            inauguration. They would maintain a constant surveillance over the new
                            administration, but would plan to move against it only if Chilean
                            institutions, particularly their own, were threatened.</p>
                        <pb n="3" facs="0043" xml:id="pg_3"/>
                        <p>F. The relations of any new Chilean administration with the US are likely
                            to be under repeated strains. Whoever succeeds <persName
                                corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName> in the presidency is likely to
                            continue to stress Chilean independence; to be less cooperative with the
                            US on many issues than <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName> has
                            been; and to explore somewhat broader relationships with Communist
                            countries. An administration elected with Communist support almost
                            certainly would take steps aimed at moving Chile away from the US and
                            closer to the Communist countries. We believe, however, that for a
                            variety of reasons, including fear of a reaction from the military, such
                            an administration would be deterred from precipitate or drastic
                            action.</p>
                        <p>G. Because <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName> himself has gone
                            on record as opposing outright expropriation of the US copper companies,
                            we see it as unlikely while he is still in power. In our judgment,
                            however, further steps toward greater government participation in or
                            even outright nationalization of these holdings are inevitable. The
                            manner, the terms, and the timetable of such steps will depend heavily
                            on the makeup of the next administration. Even under a rightist
                            administration, or one of the center left such as <persName
                                corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName>’s has been, some additional
                            “Chileanization,” at least is likely. Chile might assume high economic
                            costs in the process, especially in case of abrupt nationalization; but
                            in the long run nationalistic, political grounds—rather than
                            economic—will almost certainly be the crucial factors in deciding this
                                question.<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3">

                        <p rend="center">I. INTRODUCTION</p>
                        <p>1. Chile is entering upon a period likely to be decisive both for the
                            future of <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Eduardo Frei</persName>’s reform
                            programs and for the political direction which the nation itself will
                            take. With two years remaining of his six-year presidential term,
                                <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName> is sore beset. While
                            his administration can point to a record of considerable accomplishment
                            in some important fields, it has had almost no success in others; steps
                            taken in its social <pb n="4" facs="0044" xml:id="pg_4"/>programs have
                            conflicted with the attainment of some economic goals and the
                            government’s inability to please everyone has entailed important
                            political costs. Chile’s chronic problem of inflation has again taken a
                            turn for the worse, and its broader economic prospects—already
                            troubled—have been adversely affected by this year’s severe drought, the
                            worst in 40 years.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName>’s Christian Democratic
                            Party (<gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>) cannot hope to match its
                            previous sweeping victories as it looks ahead to a congressional
                            election in March 1969 and a presidential election in September 1970.
                            The party is suffering from factionalism. Since <persName
                                corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName> cannot legally succeed himself as
                            president, his own leverage is impaired, and no new leader of anything
                            like his stature has emerged. At the same time, there are signs of
                            growing momentum on the part of the opposition parties to the right and
                            the left of <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName>’s <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>. The opposition, which in the 1964
                            elections existed for practical purposes only on the left, has become
                            two-sided during the <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName>
                            administration. The Radical Party, which opposed him from the right as a
                            splinter in 1964, has since acquired leftist leadership. The rightist
                            Liberal and Conservative Parties, which did not even run a candidate in
                            1964, have merged to form the National Party, which under this banner
                            has recovered somewhat, while remaining a minor party. There is now
                            considerable backstage maneuvering among conservatives in favor of
                            former President Alessandri, while leftist elements talk of putting
                            together a new and stronger coalition of far-left forces. Nevertheless,
                            the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> is less divided at present than
                            its leftist opposition, is larger than the conservative forces, and has
                            some advantage from being the incumbent and the primary focus for the
                            non Marxist reform vote.</p>
                        <p>3. All this marks deterioration from the atmosphere which prevailed when
                                <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName> began his term in
                            November 1964 after a campaign in which both leading candidates pledged
                            basic reforms.<note n="4" xml:id="d1fn4">Although there was a third
                                candidate, the race was essentially between <persName

                                under Liberty,” and <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Salvador

                                the <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName> style. Both
                                drew many votes from the normal strength of the Radical Party, whose
                                candidate consequently received only some five percent of the total
                                vote. [Footnote is in the original.]</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName> had received some 56
                            percent of the total vote (as against his opponent’s 39 percent) and a
                            popular mandate to carry out far-reaching social, economic, and
                            political changes. Conditions were favorable for the use of fiscal and
                            monetary policies to achieve both price stability and economic growth.
                            Prices for copper exports—which provide the bulk of export income and an
                            important though variable element of tax receipts—rose almost 50 percent
                            during <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName>’s first two years in
                            office and have remained high. His administration has received net
                                authoriza<pb n="5" facs="0045" xml:id="pg_5"/>tions of some $630
                            million in economic assistance from the US and another $200 million from
                            international financial organizations. As has been the case for decades,
                            Chile under <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName> has received
                            more total US economic assistance per capita than any other Latin
                            American country and is second only to Brazil in total amount.</p>
                        <p>4. When, in sharp contrast to usual Chilean political practice, <persName
                                corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName> attempted to carry out the reform
                            program on which he campaigned, he alienated many of the upper and
                            middle class Chileans who had voted for him simply to keep the
                            Socialist-Communist coalition from attaining power. Although the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> won a large majority of the seats in
                            the Chamber of Deputies in 1965, the party secured only a minority in
                            the Senate, where about half the seats have been holdovers from 1961.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName> has had to bargain for
                            congressional support case by case and most of his legislative proposals
                            have been blocked, delayed, or substantially modified.</p>
                        <p>5. Much of <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName>’s difficulty in
                            getting his programs through Congress is due to his rejection of the
                            Chilean pattern of coalition government. While its politics are bitterly
                            partisan and the concept of a loyal opposition is virtually nonexistent,
                            Chile has a lengthy tradition of maintaining representative government.
                            This record has depended to a considerable degree upon the willingness
                            of the “ins” to arrange coalition governments under which the needs of
                            the “outs” were accommodated in return for their support in the
                            Congress. <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName>, however, has
                            chosen to go it alone. The obstruction he has faced in Congress has also
                            been due, in part at least, to the fact that earlier, as a <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> senator, <persName corresp="#p_FME_1"
                                >Frei</persName> had attacked many of the legislative proposals and
                            programs of the previous administration coalition (Liberals,
                            Conservatives, and Radicals). Nonetheless, some of the essential
                            elements of his legislative program have now been enacted. The outcome
                            of the elections of March 1969 will, of course, affect the prospects for
                            further reform proposals as well as the environment for implementing
                            reforms already enacted.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II. THE ADMINISTRATION’S RECORD</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Economic and Social Program</p>
                        <p>6. The <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName> administration has
                            had very mixed results in its efforts to improve Chile’s economic
                            conditions. Tax reforms and rising copper prices brought a sharp
                            increase in government revenues and in public investment during
                                <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName>’s first two years. The
                            administration’s inability to restrain the rise in current expenditures,
                            particularly for wages, however, resulted in increasing budgetary
                            difficulties and a slowdown in investment growth during 1967–1968.
                            During Frei’s first two years, Chile’s balance of payments also improved
                            markedly as a result of the sharp rise in copper prices and the
                            continuation of a high level of for<pb n="6" facs="0046" xml:id="pg_6"
                            />eign aid, coupled with the administration’s adoption of a more
                            flexible exchange rate policy and improved management of the foreign
                            debt. Despite continued high copper prices, the deficit on goods and
                            services climbed to $181 million in 1967, however, and Chile suffered a
                            small loss in foreign exchange reserves. Although this deficit grew by
                            another $100 million in 1968, a record inflow of foreign aid and the
                            expansion of investments by US copper companies were more than
                            sufficient to offset the imbalance.</p>
                        <p>7. Chile’s rate of economic growth during the past four years has been
                            less than the average for Latin America. Per capita output grew at a
                            moderately high rate during 1965–1966 but declined during 1967–1968 as
                            manufacturing and construction activities slowed. Agricultural
                            production has continued to lag behind the growth in population. The
                            rate of inflation slowed during the first two years of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName> administration but then speeded
                            up and reached about 28 percent in 1968. Thus, four years after
                                <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName>’s inauguration,
                            budgetary difficulties and the rate of inflation have not been
                            significantly reduced, the trade deficit continues to grow, and overall
                            economic growth is now at best sluggish.</p>
                        <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Redistribution of Income.</hi> Many of <persName
                                corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName>’s serious economic problems can
                            be attributed to the rapidity of redistribution of income in favor of
                            lower-income groups that has occurred during his administration. Wages
                            and salaries have increased much faster than prices and the overall rate
                            of economic growth. In addition, social services have expanded and a
                            large share of government investment has gone into social improvement
                            programs. Whereas previous Chilean administrations had been attentive to
                            the demands of urban middle class groups and of more highly skilled,
                            organized labor, <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Frei</persName> is the
                            first Chilean president to strive for substantial improvement in the
                            living conditions of agricultural workers and unskilled urban laborers.
                            An even more radical change has been <persName corresp="#p_FME_1"
                                >Frei</persName>’s effort to improve the political position of
                            previously submerged groups through establishment of a minimum
                            agricultural wage, attempts to unionize the campesinos, and expansion of
                            educational and other programs. The poorest workers have benefited from
                            his income policy but organized workers probably have gained
                            proportionately more, since they had the power to secure even larger
                            raises. By and large both the political and the economic gains of labor
                            have been made at the expense of others—such as owners of large and
                            middle-sized farms, private businessmen, and the wealthy class in
                            general—numbers of whom had supported the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"

                                smaller, Chilean-owned companies. The Chilean Government also has
                                interests of 25 to 30 percent, respectively, in two mines being
                                developed by Anaconda and Cerro Corporation; these mines are
                                scheduled to produce 170,000 metric tons of copper annually by the
                                early 1970’s. [Footnote is in the original.]</note> Political
                            opposition to this plan, particularly from the Communist and Socialist
                            parties which advocated outright nationalization, stalled the program in
                            Congress for some time. The US companies are scheduled to invest some
                            $480 million in production facilities to raise capacity from 620,000
                            metric tons of primary copper in 1964 to nearly 900,000 metric tons in
                            the early 1970’s. These new investments are insured by the US investment
                            guaranty program, under which the copper companies would receive
                            indemnification from the US Government in the event of expropriation
                            without compensation.</p>
                        <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Agriculture.</hi> Despite Frei’s concern with
                            Chile’s complex and enduring agricultural problems, he has made little
                            progress in resolving them. Promised improvements in farm prices were
                            short-lived, and solutions have not been found for deep-seated problems
                            such as inadequate credit, storage, and marketing mechanisms. In
                            addition, the insecurities associated with Frei’s agrarian reform
                            programs have served further to discourage long-needed private
                            investments. As a result, the country continues to be increasingly
                            dependent on imports of foodstuffs. Food shortages have been intensified
                            by the severe drought which began in the key central area of the country
                            during 1968. (See Figure 1 for the area involved and its importance to
                            the economy.) Until World War II Chile was a net exporter of foodstuffs,
                            but net imports of foodstuffs now amount to about $120 million annually.
                            Perhaps three-quarters of these imports consist of items that could be
                            produced domestically if the agricultural sector were more
                            efficient.</p>
                        <p>11. Although Frei’s agrarian reform bill was held up in Congress until
                            1967, laws passed in the previous administration enabled some moves
                            toward resettlement and land distribution. Between the end of 1964 and
                            mid-1968, the government’s agrarian reform agency acquired about four
                            percent of the total area in farms—including about 15 percent of Chile’s
                            irrigated land. Although less than one-half of the land acquired so far
                            has been obtained through expropriation, political involvement of
                            radical members of the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> has made the
                            reform more damaging economically and more abrasive socially than it
                            needed to be. About four-fifths of the land acquired has been organized
                            into some 270 government-managed cooperative settlements. The program
                            embraced about 9,000 families (some 70,000 persons) by mid-1968 and was

                            <pb n="9" facs="0049" xml:id="pg_9"/>expected to include 14,000 families
                            by the end of 1968, representing perhaps four percent of the rural
                            population. After 3 to 5 years of government tutelage, the cooperative
                            members are to decide whether to continue the cooperative or divide the
                            land up into individually owned small farms. More than $100 million has
                            now been spent on resettlement, and some of the social objectives of the
                            agrarian reform are being realized. But these outlays, and other large
                            government expenditures on fertilizers, seeds, breeding stock,
                            machinery, and agricultural credit have not accelerated the rate of
                            growth of total agricultural output. Growing government spending on
                            agriculture has been largely offset by the failure to maintain
                            profitable agricultural prices—a key plank in Frei’s original agrarian
                            reform program—and by the continuing fear of expropriation which has
                            undermined the incentives of the remaining private landowners. These
                            factors and the drought have combined to depress production severely in
                            late 1968 and early 1969. In the longer run, new foreign assistance for
                            irrigation works, agrarian reform activities, and agricultural credit
                            may help to mitigate some of the adverse effects of Chile’s longstanding
                            farm problems.</p>
                        <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Education, Housing, and Public Health.</hi> Frei
                            has given a high priority to reforms in the system of public education
                            and has made substantial progress in this field, particularly in
                            expanding school facilities and in improving the quality of instruction
                            for low-income groups. He was less successful in his housing program,
                            which during its first three years fulfilled only about a third of the
                            administration’s six-year goal of 360,000 new housing starts. The
                            program has now been revised to set a new target for low-income housing
                            and to stress self-help projects. It will probably benefit from recent
                            legislation which authorizes the Housing Ministry to expropriate urban
                            land at a fraction of its market value. Similarly, Frei is committed to
                            expansion of public health facilities, but any substantial improvement
                            requires basic reforms in the country’s chaotic social security
                            system—reforms he has so far been unable to accomplish.</p>
                        <p>13. <hi rend="italic">Inflation.</hi> During its first two years in
                            office, the administration’s stabilization program succeeded in cutting
                            back the rate of inflation. This promising beginning was undermined
                            mainly by the administration’s inability to maintain its wage policy in
                            the face of intense opposition from within the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> as well as from the far left. The Congress ignored the
                            administration’s guidelines and granted increases that allowed real
                            wages in the public sector to rise by some 42 percent during 1965–1967.
                            These large increases made it impossible to balance the budget. They
                            also made it increasingly difficult for the private sector to observe
                            the administration’s guidelines, and real wages in private employment
                            rose at an even faster rate. The government’s financial problems limited
                            public investment and required borrowing <pb n="10" facs="0050"
                                xml:id="pg_10"/>from the banks, which in turn resulted in the
                            restriction of credit available to business. Large wage gains and tax
                            increases boosted costs in the private sector, stepping up inflationary
                            pressures and putting a cost-price squeeze on some firms that
                            discouraged private investment and contributed to unemployment and a
                            slowdown in economic growth.</p>
                        <p>14. Despite worsening inflationary pressures from accelerated government
                            spending, rapidly rising real wages, and a large expansion in the money
                            supply, the rise in prices was kept to 26 percent in 1965 and 17 percent
                            in 1966.<note n="6" xml:id="d1fn6">This almost met the programmed goals
                                of 25 and 15 percent increases for those years. Prices had risen by
                                38 percent in 1964. Official government data probably understate the
                                actual rise in the price level, and thus overstate the increases in
                                real wages indicated in paragraph 13. [Footnote is in the
                                original.]</note> This achievement, however, relied heavily upon the
                            use of price controls and emergency measures. By 1967, the combination
                            of growing demand, rising real costs, and stagnating output were too
                            strong for price controls to be effective, and the cost of living rose
                            by 22 percent, as compared with a goal of only 10 percent. The original
                            goal for 1968 was relative price stability, but the rise in the cost of
                            living reached about 28 percent. In an attempt to limit the ability of
                            Congress to inflate greatly its wage recommendations for 1969, the Frei
                            administration included its wage readjustment legislation in the 1969
                            budget bill. As submitted, the legislation provides for a general
                            increase of 22 percent in public sector wages, yet special raises
                            authorized but not paid fully last year to certain public
                            employees—teachers, judges, the military and the police—bring the
                            overall rise in the public sector wage bill to 38 percent. Pressures for
                            wage raises are likely to be even greater in the private sector. Thus we
                            think it almost certain that the Frei government’s foundering
                            stabilization program will be put in further jeopardy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Government Role in the Economy</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>15. The Chilean Government has played an important role in the economy
                            since the 1930’s, and has been particularly instrumental in developing
                            the industrial sector, which now contributes about 25 percent of gross
                            national product (GNP). Government influence on the economy takes a
                            variety of forms: outright ownership and equity participation in joint
                            companies, financing of private investments in manufacturing and mining
                            and commerce, large transfer and subsidy payments, plus tax concessions,
                            price controls, and trade restrictions aimed at influencing production.
                            Despite the many advantages granted to the industrial sector over the
                            past three decades, however, manufacturing has focused on import
                            substitution and its products are high-cost and noncompetitive outside
                            the protected domestic market.</p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="0051" xml:id="pg_11"/>
                        <p>16. Under Frei, the public sector has expanded substantially, and its
                            expenditures in 1968 were equivalent to nearly half of Chile’s GNP—the
                            highest ratio in South America. Moreover, while the total share of
                            output allocated to investment is gradually declining, the public sector
                            has become far more important than the private sector in capital
                            formation, in part because foreign financing has gone chiefly to support
                            government investment. Public investment expenditures, which include
                            government loans for private investment in petrochemicals, paper,
                            cellulose, and steel, now represent more than 70 percent of total gross
                            domestic investment. In the early 1960’s they usually were less than 50
                            percent of the total. Public investment under Frei has continued to be
                            concentrated on transportation and electric power facilities, and on
                            housing, education, and other social welfare projects. Government
                            spending has only partly offset the depressing effect the
                            administration’s economic policies have had on private investment in
                            manufacturing and agriculture.</p>
                        <p>17. Within the private sector of the economy, and particularly among the
                            larger landowners, the traditional distrust of government programs has
                            intensified under the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>
                            administration. While Frei and the more conservative leaders of the
                            party have reiterated the continued importance of private enterprise,
                            legislative and administrative actions have done little to lend credence
                            to their statements. Private interests understandably resent the
                            squeezing of their profits between price controls on the one hand and
                            ever-rising taxes and wages on the other. This squeeze has been
                            exacerbated by a severe tightening of credit, except for the projects
                            being promoted by the government in certain industries. Investor
                            confidence has been further eroded by uncertainties concerning land
                            reform policy and by repeated threats against private industry
                            (including nationalization) that have emanated from the more leftist
                            elements within the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> as well as from
                            Marxist parties. The present environment for private enterprise also
                            appears to have dampened the interest of potential foreign investors,
                            except for the US copper companies (whose new expenditures are insured)
                            and the foreign partners in a few major investment projects arranged
                            some time ago.</p>

                        <p>18. While Frei’s efforts to carry out his reform program have antagonized
                            the more conservative elements in Chile, he has, at the same time,
                            successfully resisted leftist demands for more rapid and extreme
                            actions. A leftist faction within his own party, which has grown in
                            influence, has joined with other leftists to insist that the scope of
                            reform be widened and its tempo quickened. By pushing ahead with reforms

                        <p>19. Within the party, supporters of the President (called <hi

                            down their differences in the interest of unity, but that effort is
                            likely to break down once the congressional election is over and each
                            faction begins to vie for the nomination. Frei’s most determined
                            opponents in the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>, the far-left <hi

                            and electric power industries, and the telephone companies, and a sharp
                            rise in expropriation and distribution of land holdings. This faction is
                            particularly critical of the meager results of Frei’s agrarian policies
                            (under which land may be redistributed to perhaps 35,000 families during
                            1965–1970 instead of the announced goal of 100,000 families), and his
                            failure to nationalize the privately owned elements of the banking
                            system. Another group, the <hi rend="italic">Terceristas,</hi> also
                            criticizes the slow pace of Frei’s reform program, but tries to bridge

                        <p>20. <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Radomiro Tomic</persName>, at present
                            the leading contender for the party’s nomination to succeed Frei, has
                            agreed with the party rebels on the desirability of forging a vaguely
                            defined wide leftist front with the Communists and other groups seeking
                            sweeping economic, social, and political reforms. He has also, while not
                            openly breaking with Frei, advocated a further reduction of the role of
                            private enterprise in Chile. But <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName>’s development of a campaign platform, with
                            specific proposals which would win such wide support, remains vague and
                            in a state of flux.</p>
                        <p>21. The fact that the Frei administration has initiated and brought
                            forward some basic reforms and improvements should constitute a
                            political asset for the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>, however
                            difficult to measure. Through social action and other programs of varied
                            effectiveness both in the cities and in the countryside, large numbers
                            of people throughout the nation, including practically everyone on
                            salary, have seen significant improvement in their condition since Frei
                            took office. In recent years, however, the opposition has usually gained
                            ground in the congressional election preceding the Chilean presidential
                            election.</p>
                        <p rend="center">III. OUTLOOK</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Economic</p>
                        <p>22. The outlook for the Chilean economy over the next year or so is
                            bleak. Although a few aspects of the situation are favorable, such as
                            the foreign investment to expand copper production and the likely
                            continuation of foreign assistance, circumstances generally are
                            distinctly unfavorable. Already caught in a quandary of economic
                            stagnation with rapid inflation, the Frei administration faces
                            increasing economic difficulties and reduced capabilities to deal with
                            them. The chances of positive government action to cope with the
                            country’s problems appear slim because Frei, as a lameduck president,
                            probably will have even <pb n="13" facs="0053" xml:id="pg_13"/>greater
                            difficulty in securing congressional support than in the past. As the
                            elections approach, pressures for government spending on wages and
                            welfare almost certainly will intensify, and business confidence will
                            reach a new low, thus further slowing investment. Even with normal
                            climatic conditions, per capita output probably would not have grown in
                            1969. With the added blow from the drought, the administration faces the
                            likelihood of a decline in production in 1969 and perhaps only a partial
                            recovery in 1970.</p>
                        <p>23. Although prices for Chile’s copper exports have remained abnormally
                            high throughout the past four years, some decline probably will occur in
                            1969 and 1970. Even the scheduled expansion in production probably will
                            not keep copper earnings from dropping in 1969, and it might merely
                            restore them to 1967–1968 levels in 1970. Inasmuch as the drought is
                            reducing supplies of hydroelectric power and of water, needed by the
                            copper industry, production gains may be lower than projected. The
                            drought will also increase the need for food imports while reducing
                            agricultural exports. Chile’s deficit on goods and services may increase
                            by about $150 million in 1969 to a record high of more than $425
                            million—or about one-half of total commodity export earnings.
                            Nonetheless, large-scale drawings on official credits (already in the
                            pipeline or being negotiated with the US Government and international
                            financial organizations) and the inflow of investment capital (chiefly
                            from US copper companies) may be sufficient to cover most or all of such
                            a deficit as well as to finance scheduled debt repayments. The Frei
                            administration, however, may find it more difficult to avoid serious
                            balance of payments difficulties and a return to import restrictions in
                            1970. Its ability to do so again will depend largely on the willingness
                            of foreign lenders to be fully responsive to Chile’s financial
                            needs.</p>
                        <p>24. Frei’s prospects for averting further setbacks in his stabilization
                            program are also unfavorable. In the past the administration has fared
                            poorly in its efforts to hold down wage increases in the public sector,
                            and it will have even less influence with a Congress looking to the
                            elections of 1969 and 1970. There is little chance that expenditures for
                            public investment will be cut, because of the negative impact of such a
                            cut on politically important welfare projects and on employment levels.
                            It will be difficult to secure new tax revenues to keep the budget
                            deficit manageable. Yet failure to hold budget deficits within certain
                            limits will not only feed the inflation but may also endanger continued
                            receipt of budget support aid from the US and drawings on standby
                            credits from the International Monetary Fund.</p>
                        <p>25. We conclude that the Frei administration will have few, if any,
                            attractive options in determining its economic policies. Rather, the
                            choice is likely to be among several unpalatable alternatives, and as
                                <pb n="14" facs="0054" xml:id="pg_14"/>problems mount, both Frei and
                            his opposition will be increasingly tempted to seek solutions that are
                            politically expedient. Thus pressure is likely to be exerted on the
                            government to tax the foreign-owned copper mines at a higher rate than
                            that agreed upon under the copper expansion program, to demand a larger
                            equity in the mines, or even to nationalize the properties outright.
                            Because Frei himself has gone on record as opposing outright
                            expropriation, we see it as unlikely while he is still in power. Members
                            of his party may, however, declare in favor of partial or complete
                            nationalization during his last year in office, in an attempt to
                            undercut their political opponents. Even those members of the National
                            Party who have been friendly to the US may come to share the growing
                            Chilean sentiment for early nationalization. Expropriation would be more
                            profitable politically than economically, however, since the payment of
                            compensation would be a major drain on income, adding perhaps $1 billion
                            to an already burdensome foreign debt. If it did not compensate for such
                            an expropriation, Chile would probably lose more in US economic aid and
                            private capital investment than it secured from taking over the copper
                            companies.</p>
                        <p>26. In sum, the economic problems confronting the Frei administration are
                            unsolvable in the short run and intractable in the long run. They will
                            be particularly difficult to come to grips with during the next year or
                            so, when the effect of the drought and the distraction of national
                            elections will be most apparent. Over the longer run, unless the
                            management of the country’s resources improves, the pressure from
                            population growth, particularly from its concentration in the Santiago
                            area (see Figure 1 “Chile: Drought Area and Population Distribution”),
                            will increase.<note n="7" xml:id="d1fn7">We estimate that Chile’s
                                population is about 9.2 million, about 66 percent urban, and about
                                40 percent under 15 years of age. If the population continues to
                                increase at its present rate, which we estimate at 2.4 percent per
                                annum, it will double by the year 2000. [Footnote is in the

                            Election</p>
                        <p>27. Despite the deterioration in economic prospects the effect on the
                            outcome of the congressional election in March 1969 may not be
                            particularly severe, owing to continued foreign assistance and good
                            copper prices. This election can have an important bearing on the
                            selection of candidates and the formation of political coalitions for
                            1970, although voting patterns in local congressional elections are not
                            necessarily repeated in presidential contests where mass voter attention
                            tends to focus on large national issues and personalities. The results
                            are particularly important to the moderates in the <gloss

                            of the party organization will be critically affected by the <gloss

                            election. The party, which <pb n="15" facs="0055" xml:id="pg_15"/>has 10
                            of the 20 hold-over seats in the Senate, should approach a majority
                            there and may even attain it. (See Figure 2: “Chilean Political
                            Parties.”) The present <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> majority in
                            the Chamber of Deputies was won, in the election of March 1965, when the
                            other parties were in considerable disarray in the aftermath of Frei’s
                            triumph in September 1964. Recovery of the other parties will probably
                            keep the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> from holding its majority
                            in the Chamber, but it is likely at least to retain a sizable plurality
                            there, and it could attract enough support from independents and smaller
                            parties to form temporary majorities. But a poor showing by the party’s
                            congressional slate—which was approved by Frei—would intensify existing
                            problems of party discipline and further weaken its chances in the
                            presidential election.</p>
                        <p>28. The congressional election is also important to the chances of the
                            parties of the right and extreme left in 1970. If, as seems likely,
                            there is a further comeback by the small conservative National Party,
                            this would enhance the chances that <persName corresp="#p_ARJ_1">Jorge
                                Alessandri</persName>, a popular former president, would run
                            strongly, as an “independent” presidential candidate. The Nationals were
                            badly damaged in the Christian Democratic triumphs of 1964 and 1965 and
                            lack a popular base, but they will probably continue, on a modest scale,
                            the recovery they made in the municipal elections of 1967. They may win
                            some additional seats in the Chamber of Deputies, but are likely to
                            suffer some losses in the Senate.</p>

                            which probably has about 35,000 active members, has gained status as a

                            will probably lose little, if any, of the electoral following which

                            attract some voters who normally support Communist candidates but were
                            alienated by the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia. Socialist
                            criticism of the occupation has caused new strains in the already shaky
                            Socialist-Communist electoral coalition (the <gloss target="#t_FRAP_1"
                                >FRAP</gloss>), but the coalition has survived other serious strains
                            in the decade it has been in existence. Furthermore, the Socialist Party
                            recognizes that it needs Communist support for its leader, <persName

                        <p>31. The Radical Party, which has recovered from a very poor showing in
                            the presidential election of 1964 (five percent of the vote), also
                            suffers from factionalism. It has traditionally found its main support
                            in the middle class. The rightwing of the party leans towards Alessandri
                            while its present leftist leadership is seeking an electoral coalition
                            with the Communists and, if possible, with the Socialists. The Radicals
                            are united only in their desire to regain power and in their bitter
                            hostility towards Frei and the Christian Democrats. The Radical Party is
                            likely to gain some additional seats in the lower house and to do no
                            better than hold the 10 seats it now has in the Senate. Once the
                            congressional election is over, some moderates and many of the more
                            conservative Radicals are likely to increase their opposition to the
                            efforts of the party’s leaders to align it with the <gloss

                        <p>32. Until the final choice of candidates and of political party
                            alignments is made, it is not feasible to attempt an estimate of the
                            outcome of the presidential election in more than the most general
                            terms. A two-man race is possible, but among many possibilities we
                            believe that the most likely will be a closely contested three-man
                            race.</p>
                        <p>33. The problem for the left will be to unite competing elements of the
                            Socialist and Radical Parties, with Communist support, behind a single
                            candidate. The prospects for such a coalition are affected by
                            ideological as well as tactical differences among all three parties.
                            While the Communists publicly stress the primacy of the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRAP_1">FRAP</gloss>, they seem disposed to join any
                            coalition which they think they can influence. The Socialists, on the
                            other hand, have repeatedly rejected the idea of cooperation with
                            non-Marxist parties, and continue to cling to their intention of
                            presenting a presidential candidate in 1970. However, the Communists,
                            and even more so the Radicals, have not committed themselves and may
                            have serious misgivings about backing a Socialist candidate. Finally,
                            only a portion of the Radical Party favors an alignment with the far
                            left.</p>
                        <p>34. Despite these differences, an effective coalition of these three
                            parties is a possibility. If they can coalesce, their candidate would be
                            a <pb n="18" facs="0058" xml:id="pg_18"/>strong contender, especially in
                            a three-man race.<note n="9" xml:id="d1fn9">The Socialist, Radical, and

                                percent of the vote in the municipal elections of 1967. See Figure
                                2. [Footnote is in the original.]</note> Many members of these
                            parties would not support a coalition candidate from another party or
                            from an “alien” faction of their own party. On the other hand, we
                            believe that the candidate of any far-left coalition would benefit from
                            the likely continuation of the general trend to the left that has marked
                            Chilean politics in recent decades. Thus he would be likely to receive
                            considerable support from the large bloc of nonaligned, independent
                            voters and to gain some adherents from former <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> voters, unless that party chose a standard bearer
                            satisfactory to its radical wing.</p>
                        <p>35. No matter who wins the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>
                            nomination, there is likely to be some splitting off of party members
                            and followers. The party has no potential candidate as broadly appealing
                            as Frei. Nor is it likely to form an electoral alliance with one of the
                            other large political parties, on either the left or right. At this
                            point there seems to be very little chance that <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Radomiro Tomic</persName> will be successful in
                            forging a broad coalition of leftist forces behind his candidacy or that
                            the party is likely again to receive any substantial support from the
                            Chilean right. Most likely, the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>
                            will run as a centrist force, with its candidate appealing either for
                            leftist or rightist support, depending on which faction of the party he
                            represents, in the hope of securing a plurality of the total vote. The
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> has strong advantages as the
                            incumbent party, the largest single party, and a focus for the
                            non-Marxist reform vote. But at this point its chances depend heavily
                            upon a variety of circumstances which are beyond its control and at
                            present unforeseeable.</p>
                        <p>36. The opposition of the National Party and other Chilean conservatives
                            to Frei’s attempts to carry out basic reforms by constitutional means
                            has not made conservatism more popular in the country, but rather has
                            increased the sentiment for radical change. The conservative forces
                            might regain some ground if the aging Alessandri (born 1896) were to
                            campaign vigorously. His remarkable appeal cuts across class and party
                            lines and also reaches a considerable number of independent voters. The
                            conservatives have no other candidate of comparable stature, and without
                            Alessandri in the race they would be likely to suffer another decline in
                            strength and influence in 1970.</p>
                        <p>37. In sum, the current odds are that there will be a three-man race, in
                            1970, in which no candidate will win a clear majority, and the final
                            choice will be made by the Chilean Congress. The necessity for such a
                            decision has arisen several times in the last 50 years. On each occasion
                            the Congress has chosen the candidate with the largest number of <pb
                                n="19" facs="0059" xml:id="pg_19"/>votes. We believe that the
                            Congress probably would do so again, particularly if there is a clear
                            margin between the two leading candidates.</p>
                        <p>38. Whoever is elected in 1970 will have considerable difficulty in
                            getting any program through the Congress, let alone a controversial one.
                            Frei has said that his fundamental mistake was in not pushing hard,
                            early in his term, for an amendment of the Constitution that would
                            enable the president (once during his term in office) to dissolve the
                            Congress and, in effect, to request a plebiscite on his program. If
                            Frei’s four years in power have demonstrated anything, it is that even a
                            president with the unusual advantage of a majority, both in the popular
                            vote and in the lower chamber, finds it very rough going indeed when he
                            attempts to change the status quo in Chile.</p>
                        <p>39. The well trained security forces of Chile have always been
                            essentially antagonistic to the Communists and Socialists; this is
                            particularly true of the paramilitary national police force, the
                            Carabineros, who have had a long history of clashes with extreme
                            leftists. Even so, the security forces have maintained an apolitical
                            position towards national politics for 30 years; on the two occasions
                            (1938 and 1946) when a president was elected with Communist support, the
                            military did not intervene to keep him from taking office. Rather than
                            intervene at once to keep a Communist-supported administration from
                            taking office in 1970, the security forces would probably maintain a
                            constant surveillance over it, particularly if it were led by <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Salvador Allende</persName>, and would plan to
                            move against it only if they were convinced that Chilean institutions,
                            especially their own, were threatened.</p>
                        <p>40. For their part, the Communists and Socialists have vied with the
                            other political parties in praising the armed forces and in supporting
                            appropriations for military equipment, and have repeatedly professed
                            approval of the role of the military as the protectors of constitutional
                            government. We believe that any Communist-supported administration would
                            be careful, at least initially, to avoid any action likely to cause the
                            military to intervene.<note n="10" xml:id="d1fn10">The security forces

                            that even these leaders would be deterred from precipitate or drastic
                            action by several important considerations:</p>
                        <p>a. An awareness of the strength of nationalist sentiment in the
                            population generally, in the Congress, and in their own parties—a
                            nationalism likely to be as strongly against subordinating Chile to the
                            tutelage of Moscow (or Havana) as it has been against anything it
                            considers subordination to Washington;</p>
                        <p>b. A realization that they must have and retain the support of political
                            elements other than those that elected them if their administration is
                            to be at all effective—especially since counsels would probably be
                            divided in their own ranks on some aspects of both foreign and domestic
                            policy;</p>
                        <p>c. A concern that if their administration tried to move too far and too
                            fast, the Chilean security forces would unseat it;</p>
                        <p>d. An apprehension (and one which Moscow would probably share) that
                            anything approaching a full embrace of communism in Chile would
                            precipitate action on the part of Argentina, Peru, the US, and other
                            countries—perhaps action in support of a takeover by the Chilean
                            military, perhaps even direct military intervention.</p>
                        <p>42. All these factors are likely to inhibit a new president, even if he
                            represents the extreme left, from bringing about the adherence of Chile
                            to one or another segment of the Communist camp. These considerations do
                            not, however, argue against a radical shift in internal programs or
                            against an intensification of the effort to be independent of the US. In
                            our view, whoever succeeds to the presidency will be less cooperative
                            with the US than Frei has been. We think that there will be pressures in
                            almost all political parties, including the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss>, for the new Chilean Government to stake out a more
                            independent line; in some of them, demands for a clearly anti-US posture
                            will be strong. Thus Chilean relations with the US are likely to be
                            under repeated strain over the foreseeable future. Any new
                            administration will probably explore somewhat closer ties with Communist
                            countries. And the skillful low key way in which the Soviet Embassy in
                            Santiago has conducted its relations with the Chilean Government and
                            public might begin to bring an expansion of trade and cultural relations
                            between the two countries. Thus far, however, little progress has been
                            made in implementing the economic agreements with the <gloss

                        <p>43. We think that the next Chilean administration, regardless of who
                            heads it, will continue Chile’s traditional policies supporting
                            nonintervention, the protection of national sovereignty, and the
                            sanctity of treaties. The policies of a new administration will continue
                            to be strongly influenced by the recurrent border disputes with
                            Argentina, by Bolivia’s efforts to regain the outlet to the sea it had
                            lost to Chile in the last century, and by concern that Peru will renew
                            its claim to territory it too lost to Chile. The next administration is
                            likely to push even harder than Frei did to stress the independent
                            nature of Chile’s role in both the Organization of American States and
                            the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>44. Perhaps the touchiest issue of all in relations with the US will be
                            that of ownership or control of the US share in the copper companies.
                            Further steps toward greater government participation in or even
                            outright nationalization of these holdings are, in our judgment,
                            inevitable. The manner, the terms, and the timetable of such steps will
                            depend heavily on the makeup of the next administration. An extreme
                            leftist government would very likely opt for complete and rapid
                            nationalization. Even under a rightist administration, or one of the
                            center left such as Frei’s has been, some additional “Chileanization,”
                            at least, is likely. Chile might assume high economic costs in the
                            process, especially in case of abrupt nationalization; but in the long
                            run nationalistic, political grounds—rather than economic—will almost
                            certainly be the crucial factors in deciding this question.</p>

                            1160; Santiago 1161.</p>
                        <p>1. I told Frei I wanted to understand political factors before
                            discussions economic policies since one was largely hitched to the
                            other. I assumed that <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> policy for
                            its remaining 20 months (inauguration new <pb n="22" facs="0062"
                                xml:id="pg_22"/>President November 1970) would be tailored in
                            significant degree to fit the style of the voters it wanted to impress
                            most. Economics in the abstract was of academic interest; for a
                            politician it had to be possible above all else.</p>
                        <p>2. Frei agreed. He said inflation was the decisive element and the
                            government had to control its expenses above all. (I suspect that while
                            he was sincere, this opening gambit was in anticipation of what he
                            expected me to say. It is worth noting that in the earlier political
                            discussion he had recalled telling <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName> that the single greatest [garble] was not
                            inflation but the disunity of the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>
                            to which <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> had made very
                            notable contributions by continuing his earlier intra-party fight
                            against Frei even after he had lost the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> nod. Without such divisions between party and
                            government, the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> would easily have
                            had three to four percent more of the vote and then everyone would have
                            hailed the triumph of the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>. This in
                            turn, said Frei, would have provided <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName> with the momentum to be victor in the presidential
                            elections. <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> was the victim
                            of his own egocentricity.) Frei said very passionately that if the US
                            did not help Chile now with the pending loans, all the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> programs would have to be changed.
                            What he would do about inflation and the drought would have to be
                            recalculated. But it was imperative that he know our response soon. He
                            simply could not delay much longer.</p>
                        <p>3. I said I assumed that Frei would adhere to a stabilization policy
                            since the lack of unity on this issue within his own government and
                            between the government, and party had undermined his own policies. I
                            also recognized that politics are not controllable in a democracy be it
                            his or ours; yet I wondered if coherence within a government was equally
                            unattainable. In any event I was there, on the assumption that my
                            government would act positively soon, to offer some suggestions.</p>
                        <p>A. I repeated the arguments I have made to him and to anyone else who has
                            listened for the past 15 months about the need to liberate the economy
                            from the deadweight of unmanageable price control. Admittedly it would
                            take a few years but some effective instruments are available. A unique
                            organization, <gloss target="#t_UNICOOP_1">UNICOOP</gloss>, had had very
                            impressive success with supermarkets in Santiago; its social conscience
                            and its excellent private enterprise management had combined to produce
                            profits being reinvested in low as well as higher income neighborhoods.
                            They had enjoyed a considerable psychological success in low income
                            areas; it was a high priority desire of Pobladores to have one in their
                            neighborhood. <gloss target="#t_UNICOOP_1">UNICOOP</gloss> had recently
                            signed the first multi-year labor contract in Chile (three years); it
                            offered profit sharing to its employees. It provided a viable, efficient
                            alternative to the robbery of the poor by merchants who cheated on
                            quality, on weight and on usurious interest. Since the majority of
                            Chileans were urbanized, a third of them <pb n="23" facs="0063"
                                xml:id="pg_23"/>packed in Santiago, the politicians would always
                            cater to the city-dweller. By controlling urban prices it was difficult
                            to stimulate agriculture even with the kinds of reforms, incentives and
                            benefits offered by the Frei government. Moreover the heavy hand of a
                            bureaucracy seeking to control 6000 products was felt everywhere. And
                            Christian Democrats had a particularly abrasive bureaucratic quality
                            that in more cases than not was distasteful to the public. A major
                            effort to speed the expansion of <gloss target="#t_UNICOOP_1"
                                >UNICOOP</gloss> together with government internal decisions to ease
                            some of the burdens on <gloss target="#t_UNICOOP_1">UNICOOP</gloss>
                            could be a healthy incentive for more producer-retailer links which
                            would be emulated by others and which would eliminate the ruinous
                            high-cost middleman bottlenecks which drove up food prices and made a
                            hash of rational distribution in the country. I had been the principal
                            exponent of this philosophy and its advantages with both the <gloss
                                target="#t_BID_1">BID</gloss> from <persName corresp="#p_HLF_1"
                                >Herrera</persName> down and with the World Bank, starting with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRS_1">McNamara</persName>. Both organizations
                            had flashed a green light of assent. But after considerable effort, I
                            discovered that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> had just shoved
                            a request for a <gloss target="#t_CORA_1">CORA</gloss> land reform loan
                            ahead of the pending <gloss target="#t_UNICOOP_1">UNICOOP</gloss> (2.4
                            million) <gloss target="#t_BID_1">BID</gloss> loan thus delaying this
                            project a few more months. Since the <gloss target="#t_BID_1"
                                >BID</gloss> experts had assured me that within a year of approval
                            of the present loan they would be prepared to consider another for
                            double the amount, this unjustified delay would be interpreted by <gloss
                                target="#t_BID_1">BID</gloss> as a deliberate reordering of
                            priorities. Yet the <gloss target="#t_UNICOOP_1">UNICOOP</gloss>
                            potential, which could and would serve as a model for other chains in
                            Santiago and in other urban areas, could do more to free agriculture
                            from traditional restraints so as to provide incentives for production,
                            then <gloss target="#t_BID_1">BID</gloss>s <gloss target="#t_CORA_1"
                                >CORA</gloss> loan. Moreover since the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> had to announce its 1969 pricing policy for agriculture
                            next week (a point I emphasized later) it should couple such a harbinger
                            of higher prices with a sweetener for the housewife. A government
                            program of support for the rapid expansion of supermarkets would be one
                            such popular reassurance—and one which would also reassure the private
                            sector, particularly the Chilean private sector since <gloss
                                target="#t_UNICOOP_1">UNICOOP</gloss> was 100 percent Chilean.
                            Finally, since funds were available from international institutions and
                            expertise from them or from us, it would not cost the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>. Indeed, the end purpose was to reduce
                            the bureaucratic monstrosity that was spread all over the landscape.
                            Frei, who likes this idea, asked if he could not reverse the order of
                            priority for <gloss target="#t_BID_1">BID</gloss> consideration of the
                            loans. I replied that I believed it was too late, but would seek to
                            learn. (Washington action).</p>
                        <p>B. I emphasized the need to get approval of his social security reform
                            bill designed to reduce the high administrative overhead and to avoid
                            certain future bankruptcy of the system. I suggested that this bill,
                            plus his constitutional reform bill, plus his soon to be submitted
                            indirect taxation reform measure, could be helped by the Nacionales.
                            According to the pressure required, I suggested that he consider
                                influ<pb n="24" facs="0064" xml:id="pg_24"/>encing the Nacionales
                            with the leftist threat of reducing the voting age to 18. The Marxists,
                            Radicals and probably the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> would
                            back the 18-year measure so as to reduce the Alessandri probabilities in
                            1970. If the President were to trade a veto of this measure in return
                            for his bills, and if he thought this was practical, it would in my view
                            be an excellent deal. Frei was much intrigued (and I have since put it
                            to <persName corresp="#p_ZLA_1">Zaldivar</persName> who shared the
                            interest).</p>
                        <p>C. I said a greater effort should be made to eliminate the deficits in
                            such government enterprises as the various transportation entities. Also
                            I suggested separating the pending education bill into two parts, one
                            dealing with the controversial planning aspects and the other with the
                            indispensable self-financing of university level students. I suggested
                            again the possibility of savings accounts with readjustable interest
                            rates in private banks (not alone for the Banco del Estado as today) to
                            incite more savings. No reaction.</p>
                        <p>D. I proposed that he consider changing the Ley de Inamovilidad since its
                            freezing of workers in plants impels managers with large numbers of
                            workers to invest in labor-intensive uneconomic technology while
                            provoking new plants to invest in capital intensive equipment so as to
                            avoid a permanent albatross of working force. Since it was probably
                            impossible to alter the situation in extant plants why not create a new
                            incentive for new plants and at the same demonstrate the government’s
                            interest in creating jobs by suspending the Ley for them. Frei was
                            delighted with “a really good idea I had never heard before.”</p>
                        <p>4. Frei said he had appointed a committee to define his government’s
                            socio-economic policies for the remainder of its term. It was led by
                            Zaldiver and included the President and Vice President of the Central
                            Bank (<persName corresp="#p_MAC_1">Carlos Massad</persName> and Jorge
                            Caus), Senators Reyes and Musalem, Deputy Luis Pareto, and his
                            Presidential Advisor Marfan (a totally officialista group, of course).
                            One idea under study was executing more projects in urban centers to
                            have a psychological impact which was lacking when efforts were
                            concentrated on the peripheries of cities; this would involve some
                            slight changes in plans.</p>
                        <p>5. He said the problem of Chilean private enterprise was the change the
                            past three years from a position of unused available capacity to full
                            employment of extant plant. He doubted that the market offered
                            sufficient attractions for significant local private investments. Only
                            with formation of Andean Group or <gloss target="#t_LAFTA_1"
                                >LAFTA</gloss> or marked changes in commerce with neighbors would
                            there be much stimuli unless fresh major investment in basic industries
                            (petro chemicals, minerals) was made by foreigners together with <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>. Chilean private industry knew that
                            the current high level of activity was largely due to the flow of copper
                            investment from abroad. Unless they saw equivalent amounts in the
                            offing, it would be difficult to persuade them to invest; hence the <pb

                        <p>1172. Subj: Postscript to Frei Conversation (Politics). Refs: Santiago
                            1161.</p>
                        <p>1. Frei congratulated me on the accuracy of my pre-electoral predictions
                            and noted another “success”—that I had realized my hope of dissuading
                            Chilean and American industrialists from supporting the Radical Party.
                            He said the Radicals had undoubtedly been hurt by the shortage of funds
                            (except for Senators <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Bossay</persName> and
                            Sule who had many friends). But the current Marxist-Courtin leadership
                            of the Radicals had been given a hard boot and I had served Chilean
                            democracy well by my well-placed kick.</p>
                        <p>2. However, he wanted me to know that Anaconda had made a great effort to
                            get elected Senator Mauras in the north. Fortunately it had not
                            succeeded. Moreover, he had just discovered that Anaconda had cut off
                            its gravy to defeated Radical Senator Jonas-Gomez in the same zone.</p>
                        <p>3. I remarked that what pleased me most about the US was the recent
                            elections marked the first time in many years that the US, private or
                            public, had not been accused by anyone of playing a role in the
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>4. Frei also disclosed that it was costing about 30,000 escudos monthly
                            ($3,000) to run the organization he has established to maintain his
                            control over the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> (<gloss
                                target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>). When I asked if funding were a
                            problem, he replied candidly that politicians with good causes never
                            have difficulty finding friends with funds.</p>

                            Chilean budget, the Chilean Finance Minister will try to squeeze that
                            amount from the US-owned copper companies by a forced loan. <persName

                            resist strongly and will look to the US Government to defend their

                            and the political center (i.e., Christian Democratic Party-<gloss

                            in a radical shift leftward which in turn could lead to:</p>

                            influence the trend of events through Frei, with supporting help from
                            Alessandri (the probable conservative <pb n="27" facs="0067"
                                xml:id="pg_27"/>candidate in 1970), presumably with a program loan
                            which would have the qualitative effort of “demonstrating US interest in

                        <p>Negotiations for a $20 million program loan for Chile were authorized
                            last December by President <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1"

                            balance of payments support for Chile’s 1969 economic program. However,
                            it was based on the assumption that the copper price would average 45-½¢
                            per pound or less (each 1¢ in the price of copper translates into $5.5
                            million in revenues for the Chilean Government and $9.5 million in
                            foreign exchange earnings for the balance of payments). Since the copper
                            price is up around 62¢ per pound, State and <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss> have concluded that the economic basis for the program
                            loan no longer exists.</p>
                        <p>In March, <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> agreed that
                            economic conditions had changed, but he proposed going forward with the
                            loan on the basis of a different program—namely, support for further
                            Chilean import liberalization. State and <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss> did not find this acceptable, and instead proposed a
                            standby arrangement which would be triggered by a fall in copper prices:
                            if the copper price falls to 51¢, $10 million would be made available;
                            if it falls to 49¢, another $10 million would be made available.</p>
                        <p>This standby proposal is currently before the interagency Development
                            Loan Committee, and State and <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>
                            intend to hold to that position. <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName> indicates, however, that the Chilean Finance
                            Minister has rejected the idea of a standby loan.</p>
                        <p>As far as I can tell, none of the Washington agencies believe there is an
                            economic case for a program loan for Chile at this time. (Treasury and
                            BOB even have some doubts about the need for a standby). Assistant
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName> will meet the
                            Chilean Finance Minister in Guatemala (where they are both attending the
                                <gloss target="#t_IDB_1">IDB</gloss> Board of Governors meeting) to
                            listen to his account of the situation. However, <persName

                                corresp="#p_VVP_1">Pete Vaky</persName>’s successor at State) tells
                            me that unless something new appears, State and <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss> do not intend to go beyond a standby arrangement. They
                            are not convinced by <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>’s
                            arguments that failure to provide $10 million immediately will result in
                            an <gloss target="#t_IPC_1">IPC</gloss>-like situation and a radical
                            shift to the left.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment</p>
                        <p>I think State and <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>’s handling of this
                            issue is correct. There is clearly a prospect of increased pressure on
                            the copper companies and of a shift to the left in Chile. However, the
                            question here is whether there is a causal relationship between failure
                            to provide a program loan and these developments. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> believes there is; State and
                                <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> are dubious. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> may come up to Washington to try
                            to fight this issue out, <pb n="28" facs="0068" xml:id="pg_28"/>and it
                            may ultimately come to the President for decision. In the meantime, I
                            think we should let this work its way out through the normal operational
                            channels.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> is a former
                            journalist who practices a very activist and personal style of
                            diplomacy. He is closely identified with Frei and the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>, and he feels very strongly about the
                            correctness of his position. Aside from the merits of his case, the
                            emotional tone of <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>’s cable
                            indicates that if he does not get his $10 million now, the <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> Administration might be charged
                            at some future point with responsibility for the deterioration of the
                            Chilean situation—which is likely to occur anyway—because it failed to
                            support democracy in Chile when it had the opportunity to do so. While
                            most serious analysts would recognize that the factors which could lead
                            to increased pressure on the copper companies and a shift to the left
                            are far deeper than the absence of a $10 million loan, it is also clear
                            that no one could prove that the $10 million was not the critical
                            factor. Thus, this particular question could be the focal point of a
                            political domestic attack on the Administration’s Latin America
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>It may be worth considering whether a $10 million Supporting Assistance
                            loan (for political rather [than] developmental purposes) should be
                            offered to prevent this from becoming a domestic political football (and
                            possibly to reduce the risk of—or delay—further Chilean pressure on the
                            copper companies). However, no action will be taken before <persName

                            23 (memorandum attached at Tab A) remains unresolved. Assistant
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName> talked to the
                            Chilean Finance Minister at the <gloss target="#t_IDB_1">IDB</gloss>
                            meeting in Guatemala, but <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>
                            apparently was not convinced that there is a clear economic or political
                            case for the loan.</p>
                        <p>The Finance Minister told <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>
                            he needed an answer on the loan by May 10 (a few days before he presents
                            his economic program to the Congress) or he will have to find other
                            means of financing an anticipated short-term budget deficit. (The
                            implication is that he will try to obtain a forced loan from the U.S.
                            owned copper companies, a technique used in previous years.)</p>
                        <p>The standby loan tied to the price of copper which State/<gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> was prepared to offer as an
                            alternative is unacceptable to the Chileans. Ambassador <persName

                            we should provide a $10–20 million loan and he is coming to Washington
                            this weekend with a revised proposal based on trade liberalization
                            objectives. However, his cables indicate that the underlying rationale
                            for his proposal is some combination of reasons involving economic
                            factors, political factors, and a question of honor.</p>
                        <p>I find <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>’s arguments somewhat
                            inconsistent at this point, but I prefer to hear his case before

                        <p>—The Christian Democrats (<gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>—the
                            Government party) lost badly in the March Congressional elections and
                            faced a Presidential election in September 1970 divided into quarreling
                            factions and aware that nationalization would again be an important
                            Marxist issue.</p>
                        <p>—Anaconda had recently aroused the Government and public opinion by
                            feuding over customs duties on capital imports, suing against
                            Government-established sales prices to domestic processors, and staking
                            out extensive non-copper mineral claims while failing to establish an
                            earlier agreed-upon joint exploration company. These acts led on April
                            30 to unprecedented, unanimous and rapid Congressional action depriving
                            Anaconda of its new claims.</p>
                        <p>—Copper prices have risen steadily since 1964 and have been at
                            extraordinarily high levels for the third year in a row, averaging over
                            60¢ a pound this year. Chile believed it had provided the American
                            companies windfall profits and cheated itself of its proper share in the
                            Chileanization program by agreeing to lower taxes guaranteed for twenty
                            years with no escalation clause pegged to copper prices.</p>
                        <p>—Peru’s expropriation of <gloss target="#t_IPC_1">IPC</gloss>, although
                            not a major factor, probably contributed to pressures against

                            <hi rend="italic">The Negotiations</hi>—President Frei sent a letter to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> on May 4
                            designed to reassure the U.S. that Frei wished to maintain good
                            relations and would abide by international norms in obtaining greater
                            tax revenue and Chilean participation in the American companies.
                            Anaconda and Kennecott were approached on May 9, primarily on the tax
                            issue. Anaconda was forthcoming on taxes but balked at allowing more
                            than 25% participation in its wholly owned subsidiaries. Kennecott was
                            intransigent, citing its earlier sale of 51% equity. Frei’s State of the
                            Nation speech on May 21 publicly stated the goals previously set forth
                            to the companies and the U.S. His proposals for a negotiated settlement,
                            rather than outright nationalization, and his defense of Chileanization
                            were received coldly in Congress. By early June, even the <gloss

                            of minerals from Anaconda’s subsidiaries.</p>
                        <p>Serious high-level negotiations with Anaconda began on June 2. They
                            continued virtually uninterrupted until agreement was reached on all
                            major issues on June 26. A summary of the agreement and related U.S.
                            Government actions is enclosed (Enclosure 2). Ambassador <persName

                            contribution was highly praised by both sides. He achieved the essential
                            U.S. objective: a negotiated, mutually acceptable settlement, without
                            any public attacks on the United States or any indication of the U.S.

                            settlement most favorably with the <gloss target="#t_IPC_1">IPC</gloss>
                            case. This is really valid only if the settlement as such is contrasted
                            with the last spasm in the <gloss target="#t_IPC_1">IPC</gloss>
                            negotiations when the military government came to power in Peru, and if
                            the comparison ignores the long history of negotiations under Belaunde,
                            during which the <gloss target="#t_IPC_1">IPC</gloss> continued to
                            operate. Anaconda did negotiate under great pressure and very limited
                            time constraints imposed by Chile, in contrast with the pace of the
                            earlier <gloss target="#t_IPC_1">IPC</gloss> negotiations. Moreover,
                            Anaconda was being asked to divest itself of complex properties valued
                            at perhaps $800 million, far exceeding the value of <gloss
                                target="#t_IPC_1">IPC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The method adopted—negotiation rather than outright nationalization—is,
                            however, obviously preferable. Furthermore, in the Anaconda
                            negotiations, the United States through its Ambassador played a most
                            important behind-the-scenes role. In the early years of the <gloss
                                target="#t_IPC_1">IPC</gloss> negotiations, the U.S. took a distant
                            position in the negotiations themselves, but did curtail aid to
                            Peru.</p>
                        <p>Further problems arise if the Anaconda settlement is taken as a model for
                            future agreements on acquisition of American companies <pb n="32"
                                facs="0072" xml:id="pg_32"/>by Latin American governments. The basic
                            requirements for an Anaconda-type settlement are, on one side,
                            moderation of the Government’s appetite and the Government’s political
                            power to sustain a negotiated settlement; and, on the other, adequate
                            corporate reasons for settling. Many special factors led Anaconda to
                            sign. Anaconda’s initial 51% equity is being sold at book value, hardly
                            an acceptable valuation for most companies, as evidenced even by Chilean
                            agreement to pay a multiple of earnings for the remaining 49%. The
                            atmosphere of pressure and the very limited time constraints have been
                            mentioned. Copper is so central to the Chilean economy and Anaconda is
                            such a large factor in the industry that the company knew it would be
                            nationalized if it did not agree. Moreover, the earlier Kennecott
                            settlement had established minimum terms for Anaconda. Few companies
                            would consider acceptable the extremely high taxes on profits and
                            dividends accepted by Anaconda; they are tolerable only because of the
                            extraordinarily high world copper prices and the profitability of
                            Anaconda’s operations, which have been largely amortized over forty
                            years. Also, the importance of Chile’s contribution to Anaconda’s total
                            earnings (about 66%) cannot be overlooked; without at least a brief
                            transition, Anaconda’s corporate position would be seriously
                            affected.</p>
                        <p>(B) <hi rend="italic">Anaconda Settlement and <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                    >AID</gloss> Legislation:</hi> If the Chilean script leading to
                            a negotiated settlement under pressure of nationalization is followed by
                            other developing countries, this will undoubtedly discourage U.S.
                            private investment in such countries, particularly in natural resources.
                            The <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> guaranty program will of course
                            alleviate the effect of such potential action insofar as it can be
                            directly equated to expropriation with inadequate or no compensation and
                            where such guarantees are in force. The Anaconda problem and other
                            problems that might develop over time should not, however, have an
                            immediate effect on the pending <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>
                            legislation or on the legislation for the Overseas Private Investment
                            Corporation. The Anaconda situation is clearly differentiated from
                            Kennecott. Anaconda chose not to have expropriation guarantees in force
                            during 1969, but rather to go on standby, i.e., to give up its right to
                            coverage for an insurable event (expropriation) in order to save the
                            insurance fees during that year. Consequently, regardless of the outcome
                            of the Anaconda-Chilean negotiations, Anaconda would not have been able
                            to make a claim for expropriation based on Chilean action during 1969.
                            Kennecott is expected to be the next American company negotiating with
                            Chile. Although Kennecott has its insurance on current status, the
                                <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> guaranty of this investment is
                            solely on Kennecott’s long-term debt interest and not on Kennecott’s 49%
                            equity interest. Moreover, the guaranteed debt would probably not be
                            affected by a nationalization of Kennecott’s equity because the debt
                            servicing payments do not commence until 1972. <pb n="33" facs="0073"
                                xml:id="pg_33"/>Therefore, it is highly unlikely that a substantial
                            guaranty claim would be presented in the near term.</p>
                        <p>There is a further problem with regard to the <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss> legislation. The illustrative country programs prepared
                            four months ago show an <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> program for
                            Chile for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss>-70 of $75 million, with $40
                            million in program loans and other sums for sector loans. Members of
                            Congress may well ask why the U.S. is planning to provide balance of
                            payments assistance to Chile while that country is using its foreign
                            exchange to buy out U.S. copper interests. This question will have to be
                            reviewed as part of the over-all analysis of Chile’s balance of payments
                            situation late this year. No program loan was provided to Chile this
                            year, although negotiations for a $20 million loan were completed in
                            March.</p>
                        <p>(C) <hi rend="italic">For Chilean/U.S. Relations:</hi> The chief
                            significance of the agreement, if it holds, is that it removes an
                            abrasive, historical legacy. Anaconda, for decades the primary U.S.
                            representative in Chile in economic, psychological and political terms,
                            symbolized to Chileans their inferiority to and dependence upon the
                            United States. Anaconda’s after-tax earnings in the last three years
                            exceed U.S. economic aid, although much of these earnings were plowed
                            back in new investment in Chile. There is no longer a vast foreign state
                            within a state dominating much of northern Chile, affecting
                            significantly both Chile’s foreign exchange and budget receipts, and
                            permeating all aspects of Chilean economic life through its
                            purchases.</p>
                        <p>(D) <hi rend="italic">For Chile’s Domestic Politics:</hi> Frei’s
                            Christian Democrats pre-empted one of the most important issues which
                            could have been used by opposition parties of all shades from right to
                            extreme left in the 1970 Presidential election. The agreement has
                            unified the Christian Democrats around a “victory” for their leader and
                            government and strengthened their hand for the 1970 Presidential
                            campaign. It has provided a platform on which the dissident Party
                            leader, <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Radomiro Tomic</persName>, widely
                            conceded to be the Party’s best votegetter and most likely standard
                            bearer in 1970, can make his peace with Frei and go into the
                            Presidential race with unified Party support.</p>
                        <p>(E) <hi rend="italic">Anaconda Agreement May Not Hold:</hi> The positive
                            advantages for U.S. policy occur only if the Anaconda agreement is
                            carried out. For many reasons, the agreement may not hold. Caught
                            unprepared by the sudden announcement of the agreement, the Marxist
                            opposition parties have been very restrained so far and have not settled
                            on a line of attack. They can be expected, however, to attempt to
                            frustrate Frei’s move to preempt the copper issue by finding or
                            fabricating deficiencies in the agreement. They may well push even more
                            vociferously than ever for outright nationalization or expropriation on
                            terms less favorable to Anaconda. The left could be joined by the
                            right-wing National Party, seeking to carve out an election plank for
                            themselves by im<pb n="34" facs="0074" xml:id="pg_34"/>proving the terms
                            of the agreement for Chile. The pressures of next year’s campaign
                            preclude the hope that the issue can be removed from the political
                            arena.</p>
                        <p>What is more, negotiations are about to begin with Kennecott. Its
                            position to date has been that it has already ceded majority ownership
                            of its subsidiary to Chile, and it is intransigent on payment of higher
                            taxes. If Kennecott maintains this position in negotiations or in the
                            Chilean courts, standing on the twenty-year tax guarantees in its
                            present investment decree and other agreements, the Chilean Government
                            has told our Ambassador that it is prepared to move to expropriate
                            Kennecott. It will negotiate first, but is ready to introduce whatever
                            legislation is necessary to obtain higher taxes. Any legislation might
                            easily be amended on the floor to include a modification of the present
                            Anaconda agreement or outright nationalization with only token or no
                            compensation. All the political parties in Chile have come out for
                            nationalization. The issue would then be whether President Frei would
                            veto the amended legislation, and whether he could sustain such a veto.
                            The 1970 Presidential election would loom large in such decisions.</p>
                        <p>No one can predict the 1970 election with certainty. It is likely that
                            there will be three candidates: conservative former President <persName
                                corresp="#p_ARJ_1">Jorge Alessandri</persName>, supported by the
                            Nacionales, independents, and voters of many persuasions; a Christian
                            Democratic candidate, possibly <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName>; and a leftist or Marxist candidate, who could be
                            Socialist <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Salvador Allende</persName>. The
                            Christian Democrats obtained only 30% of the vote in March and could
                            finish last. Anaconda is hoping that Alessandri will win and that the
                            agreement can be re-negotiated on more favorable terms. While he may
                            win, this hope seems illusory, given the political trends and strengths
                            in Chile and Latin America. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Salvador
                                Allende</persName> was beaten by Alessandri by only 34,000 votes out
                            of 1.2 million in the multi-candidate race in 1958, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> received 39% of the vote in an
                            essentially two-man race with Frei in 1964. Should <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> win, his government might as

                        <p>In this memorandum we examine political developments in Chile over the
                            past year and speculate about their implications for the September 1970
                            presidential election. For some years the electorate in Chile appeared
                            to have been moving steadily to the left and in the 1964 presidential
                            election nearly all the votes were garnered by the victorious Christian
                            Democrats or by the coalition of Socialists and Communists. Nonetheless,
                            the most striking and possibly the most important political development
                            in the past year has been the extraordinary rise in popularity of a
                            decidedly right-of-center figure, former President <persName
                                corresp="#p_ARJ_1">Jorge Alessandri</persName>. Apparently, despite
                            the social advances made under President Frei’s “Revolution in Liberty,”
                            much of the polity has chafed under it. Some, including a significant
                            group from Frei’s party, want more emphasis on “Revolution;” others want
                            instead more stress on “Liberty”—that is, liberty from social change and
                            political turbulence. The latter are gravitating toward Alessandri, who
                            is looked upon as a sort of political <hi rend="italic">patrón</hi> who
                            can “get things done” without turmoil. Of course, anything can happen
                            between now and the casting of ballots in September 1970, but for the
                            moment the political health of the 73-year-old Don Jorge stands out in
                            sharp contrast to the political ailments of the various leftist
                            parties.</p>
                        <p>1. Chile has always presented something of a paradox. It is famed for its
                            democratic institutions, political stability, and apolitical military.
                            Its ideologically based parties are more like those in Europe than the
                            personalistic vehicles that abound in most other Latin American
                            countries. It can boast of a number of economic and political institutes
                            that have contributed outstanding international civil servants to the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1"
                                >OAS</gloss>. Data on the social and economic ills of Chile have
                            been <pb n="36" facs="0076" xml:id="pg_36"/>systematically collected for
                            years (cost of living indexes were being kept as far back as 1913), and
                            major problems have been repeatedly analyzed. Yet solutions to most of
                            these problems have not resulted: distribution of land and personal
                            income remains inequitable, agricultural productivity remains low, and
                            inflation is still chronic.</p>
                        <p>2. It has long been accepted as a truism that the Chileans have become
                            increasingly impatient with these conditions and that the electorate has
                            steadily been turning to the left. The victory in 1964 of Christian
                            Democrat <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Eduardo Frei</persName> and his
                            efforts to initiate a “Revolution in Liberty” brought about some
                            important social changes. His government has made a significant start in
                            carrying out an agrarian reform program, markedly expanding social
                            services, and helping to bring about a large increase in the real income
                            of the poorer classes. Yet as Frei’s term approaches its end, the front
                            runner for the 1970 election is a decidedly right-of-center figure, the
                            73-year-old former President <persName corresp="#p_ARJ_1">Jorge
                                Alessandri Rodríguez</persName>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Redoubtable Don Jorge</p>
                        <p>3. When Alessandri was elected president in 1958, his victory was
                            regarded by many to be the “last chance” of the traditional conservative
                            elite to solve Chile’s recurring problems. Although 1958 marked the
                            debut of the Christian Democratic Party (<gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss>) under Frei in a presidential election, the real
                            contest was between Alessandri, an industrialist and son of a former
                            president, and <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Salvador Allende</persName>,
                            the candidate of a strong alliance of Communists, Socialists, and other
                            leftists—the Popular Action Front (<gloss target="#t_FRAP_1"
                                >FRAP</gloss>). Winning slightly over one third of the vote,
                            Alessandri barely defeated <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> while Frei placed third.</p>
                        <p>4. Remembrances of Don Jorge’s administration would hardly seem to
                            explain the extent of his present popularity. A stout defender of the
                            virtues of private enterprise, Alessandri initially made economic
                            austerity his principal policy. A capable and honest administrator, he
                            managed to raise taxes, lower expenses, and even balance the budget in
                            1959 (for the first time since his term as Minister of Finance in 1950).
                            His regime on balance was a competent but not an inspiring one; it coped
                            reasonably well with the emergency situations caused by a series of
                            earthquakes and tidal waves that took thousands of lives and caused more
                            than $200 million worth of damage in 1960. Although the economy expanded
                            at the annual rate of about five percent a year, little was accomplished
                            in the social field and the workers bore the brunt of the austerity
                            program.</p>
                        <p>5. It is difficult moreover to imagine a candidate more <hi rend="italic"
                                >antipático</hi> in the usual political sense. Alessandri, who
                            compares himself with General de Gaulle, presents a cold aloof image and
                            appears openly to disdain the people he once governed and would govern
                            again. While a <pb n="37" facs="0077" xml:id="pg_37"/>sympathetic
                            biographer says that he is not oblivious to public demands, Alessandri
                            has had as little contact with the masses as possible and eschews
                            popular demonstrations.<note n="3" xml:id="d7fn3">An American observer
                                tells how he saw Alessandri enter the opera to a standing ovation
                                from the rest of the audience. Rather than acknowledge the applause
                                with any of the ordinary politician’s gratitude, he shook his fist
                                indignantly—which only set off a new round of tumultuous applause.
                                [Footnote is in the original.]</note> Stories of his parsimonious
                            ways are legend; in contrast to his predecessors who entertained
                            lavishly at <hi rend="italic">La Moneda</hi> (the Chilean White House)
                            Alessandri was said to have made his few guests feel that they had been
                            invited to a fasting. Summing up the characteristics of the former
                            president, the same biographer noted that his “stubbornness and conceit
                            were outweighed by his sobriety and austerity.”</p>
                        <p>6. Yet apparently these rather forbidding personal qualities do have a
                            strong appeal to many Chileans and have helped create Don Jorge’s
                            remarkable popular following. Among his supporters are those who feel
                            that Frei’s “Revolution in Liberty” has gone too fast and those who feel
                            that it has not brought them any real increased benefits. The former
                            include the business classes, traditional agricultural elites, and white
                            collar workers; the latter encompass many lower income people in both
                            the cities and the countryside. All look to Don Jorge as a man worthy of
                            respect—a man above parties and politics, with links to no special
                            interest, and above all someone who can “get things done” with a minimum
                            of social turmoil. Most of his supporters seem to have forgotten the
                            social torpor of the Alessandri years but remember the relative
                            political calm. In evaluating his tenure, Alessandri was proudest of the
                            fact that there were no “social disorders in my regime, no state of
                            siege.”</p>
                        <p>7. Alessandri has made no strong efforts in recent months to warm up to
                            voters or politicians. Having maintained a position of political
                            independence, he has been assiduously courted by the rightwing National
                            Party and rightwing elements from the heterogeneous Radical Party but
                            has kept these suitors at arm’s length and made no firm political
                            commitments. Nonetheless his campaign strategy seems especially geared
                            to exploit their hopes. The former president has indicated that he will
                            wage a “realistic campaign that does not make sweeping promises but
                            concentrates on the day to day problems and bears in mind the country’s
                            true economic capabilities.” Under the slogan of “<hi rend="italic"
                                >Cosismo</hi>” (the ability to achieve) he means to show that his
                            achievements will be small but constant, as opposed to large but
                            unfulfilled promises. Furthermore he will pledge to curtail the
                            influence of “all powerful and disruptive agencies with vaguely assigned
                            responsibilities” (for that read land reform institutes and other social
                            agencies <pb n="38" facs="0078" xml:id="pg_38"/>sparked by the Christian
                            Democrats). Alessandri’s platform finally will emphasize efficiency not
                            only of government agencies but of private industry as well. In this
                            category, he promises to crack down on all corruption and bureaucratic

                        <p>8. Alessandri has to be considered the front runner, not only by his
                            supporters but also by Christian Democrats, Socialists, Communists and
                            Radicals who see the aging former chief executive in surprisingly good
                            personal health and their own organizations politically ailing. Various
                            political soundings including informal opinion polls have consistently
                            shown Alessandri’s popularity to be greater than any candidate of the
                            other parties. The congressional election of 2 March 1969 furthermore
                            showed that the promise of his return could breathe new life into the
                            once moribund National Party. By huddling under his mantle the party of
                            the traditional elites managed to increase its share of the vote from
                            14.3 percent in the 1967 municipal election to 20.0 percent, thereby
                            emerging as the second largest party in the country.<note n="4"

                            </note> The personal impact of the former president on this victory was
                            underscored by the extraordinary success of two National candidates for
                            deputy—both of whom happen to bear the name Alessandri. In one district
                            an Alessandri niece, Silvia, a housewife yanked from domestic obscurity,
                            topped a field of 81 candidates including a <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> presidential hopeful. In another a nephew, Gustavo,
                            amassed a substantial personal vote and also led the National Party
                            ticket to significant gains.</p>
                        <p>9. The Alessandri surge has only exacerbated the ideological strains and
                            factions within the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>. The
                            pro-government “<hi rend="italic">oficialista</hi>” wing recognizes the
                            trend toward a candidate who represents austerity and stability but it
                            has been challenged on its left by the “<hi rend="italic"
                            >rebeldes</hi>,” some of the most articulate and innovative elements of
                            the party. This loose faction, which included one of the original
                            founders of the party, a principal ideologue, and several youth leaders,
                            has felt that Frei’s slowness in enacting reforms represents a
                            capitulation to the forces of the right. They have charged the
                            government with forsaking the old Christian Democratic objective of a
                            “noncapitalist way of development,” and deplored one repressive action
                            in March 1969 when government security forces shot and killed squatters
                            in the process of <pb n="39" facs="0079" xml:id="pg_39"/>evicting them.
                            Disputing the traditional policy of the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> of avoiding electoral alliances, the <hi rend="italic"
                                >rebeldes</hi> argued that the only way to defeat the right in 1970
                            is to form a pact with the Marxist parties or elements from them. The
                                <hi rend="italic">rebeldes</hi> received some support in this and
                            other stands from yet a third group within the party, the “<hi
                                rend="italic">terceristas</hi>.” This latter group is also
                            disgruntled with the government’s performance but is more willing to
                            work with the party leadership.</p>
                        <p>10. Frei and the <hi rend="italic">oficialista</hi> wing have managed to
                            control the party’s direction but not without fracturing party unity.
                            The March election strengthened the <hi rend="italic">oficialista</hi>
                            position as candidates running on the government line generally did
                            better than the <hi rend="italic">rebeldes</hi>. At the subsequent
                            National Convention in May the proposal of the Frei wing to run alone
                            barely defeated the <hi rend="italic">rebelde</hi> position of “popular
                            unity” with the left. Nevertheless this victory cost the party its <hi
                                rend="italic">rebelde</hi> group, all of whom resigned or were
                            subsequently purged. This faction has now formed its own electoral
                            vehicle, the Action Movement for Popular Unity, and is currently working
                            for the movement its name implies. Moreover “popular unity” still has
                            some appeal within the <hi rend="italic">tercerista</hi> faction and
                            many continue to lobby for it within the old <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>11. Indeed, the most significant proponent for “popular unity” also
                            happens to be the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>’s most
                            significant presidential hopeful, former ambassador to the US <persName

                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> figures, he commands the broadest
                            support within the party and has long been considered the natural
                            successor to Frei. Yet he is convinced that the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> cannot go it alone in this election and that it must
                            unite with the Communists and other members of the Marxist left if it is
                            to have a prayer first of defeating Alessandri and second, once in
                            office, of effecting social change. Entreaties to both the domestic
                            Communists and the Soviets in his recent trip to Europe have been in
                            vain but he continues to advocate a united left for the 1970 election.
                            At the same time he has indicated that as a “disciplined <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> militant” he would submit to a party
                            draft, apparently with or without such unity.</p>
                        <p>12. The politics of copper have further complicated the issues of
                                <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>’ candidacy and the
                            political fortune of the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>. The
                            government’s announcement that it would pursue a policy of “negotiated
                            nationalization,” by buying up 51 percent of Anaconda Copper’s holdings
                            now and the remainder sometime after 1972, has been opposed by an
                            alliance of the Communists, Socialists, dissident Christian Democrats,
                            and the left leadership of the Radical Party. With the reluctant support
                            of the Nationals, Frei has at present sufficient strength in Congress to
                            block leftist bills calling for immediate nationalization. The president
                            has also attempted to exploit this issue to widen the gap between the
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> and the Marxist parties.</p>
                        <pb n="40" facs="0080" xml:id="pg_40"/>
                        <p>13. In this endeavor, Frei has not yet succeeded in containing <persName

                            is basically opposed to the copper accords and has espoused immediate
                            nationalization. Although he continues to be the leading aspirant for
                            the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> nomination when the party
                            convenes in August, differences within the party would be likely to hurt
                            his electoral chances. <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> and
                            Frei have agreed not to air their differences publicly but others may
                            not be so reticent. <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>’
                            advocacy of an agreement with the far left and by extension between the

                            organizations is likely to be rejected by the leftist parties and prove
                            anathema to the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> right. Some of the
                            right and even the center of the party would probably turn to Alessandri
                            if <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> were the nominee.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Infighting on the Far Left</p>
                        <p>14. “Solidarity forever” is also far from being the theme of the parties
                            on the Marxist left. While the Communist Party has been far too
                            suspicious of <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> to unite
                            under his banner, it has also had its own difficulties in maintaining
                            the formal unity of the <gloss target="#t_FRAP_1">FRAP</gloss>. The
                            party is quite conscious of Alessandri’s drawing power and feels that he
                            can be beaten only by an expansion of the <gloss target="#t_FRAP_1"
                                >FRAP</gloss>, but such a movement is being jeopardized by its
                            fractious partners, the Socialists. The Communists would like to include
                            the left wing of the Radical Party in such a coalition but this
                            inclusion is scorned by the Socialists who regard the Radicals as a
                            “bourgeois” party.</p>
                        <p>15. The growing influence of the more militant revolutionaries in the
                            Socialist Party could further complicate the prospect for electoral
                            unity in 1970. A recently concluded party plenum conceded the
                            impossibility of electing a Socialist president but urged that one be
                            nominated to carry the revolutionary program to the people. While the
                            Socialists have not rejected the concept of a popular front, they have
                            demanded that all participants adhere to the Socialist platform and have
                            refused to back any candidate other than a Socialist. As a portent of
                            future difficulties, Communist observers to the plenum were coolly
                            received and Communist parties in general were actually denounced by
                            hardliners on the Central Committee as “traitors to the Revolution in
                            Europe and Latin America.” A small far left terrorist group, the
                            Movement of the Revolutionary Left (<gloss target="#t_MIR_1"
                            >MIR</gloss>), and the Socialists’ linkage to it are another sore source
                            of contention. The Communists have always feared the capability of such
                            radical left groups to make inroads into Communist support among youth,
                            as well as their potential for triggering a general crackdown on the
                            left or a military coup. After a raid by the security forces uncovered a
                                <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> arms cache, the Communists were
                            quick to denounce the group.</p>
                        <p>16. Despite protests of political purity from the Socialists some sort of
                            coalition could be effected in the year before the election. The split
                            in <pb n="41" facs="0081" xml:id="pg_41"/>the Radical Party between the
                            leftist leadership and the rightist faction which bolted to support
                            Alessandri has made it weaker, more ideologically homogeneous, and
                            therefore more acceptable in a future pact. The emergence of the Action
                            Movement for Popular Unity has also been beneficial as it offers a
                            number of attractive figures as possible compromise leaders of a united
                            left. Lastly the Communists hope to benefit from <persName

                                Castro</persName>, it is hoped, would help smooth over inter-party
                            relations as well as isolate the far leftist MIR, preventing it from
                            making inroads into Communist youth.</p>
                        <p>17. The major and possibly insurmountable problem for a broadened <gloss
                                target="#t_FRAP_1">FRAP</gloss> will be finding a candidate
                            acceptable to all factions and parties. The past electoral standard
                            bearer of the left, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Salvador
                                Allende</persName>, has indicated his willingness to lead once again
                            and has professed the necessity of forming an all inclusive “Fatherland
                            Front.” Yet there is some doubt that he could gain the nomination of his
                            own Socialist party. Despite his close personal ties to <persName
                                corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName>, he has been under steady
                            fire from the more militant revolutionary leadership of the Socialist
                            Party. Although he maintains considerable prestige and popularity among
                            the rank and file, he has been outmaneuvered at party conferences by
                            this leadership which maintains strong control over the party machinery.
                            Even if he is successful in gaining the nomination, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has stipulated Socialist
                            acceptance of the “Fatherland Front” as a pre-condition to his running
                            in 1970. The rejection of either his candidacy or his platform could
                            lead to two rival leftist slates on the ballot, a militant Socialist and
                            a catchall leftist conglomerate dominated by the Communists.</p>
                        <p>18. Factional bickering is only one of the factors with which the left
                            has to contend. In a reversal of its apolitical stance of the past 30
                            years, the Chilean military has shown signs of increasing uneasiness
                            over the spectre of a Communist dominated government. Military leaders
                            have raised the possibility that they would stage a coup at some time
                            before the election if they saw such a leftist victory in the offing.
                            Apparently, there are, as yet, no definite plans for such a takeover and
                            no recognizable faction of perennial plotters of the sort that weave
                            around other Latin American military establishments in pre-<hi

                            probably attempt to garner widespread civilian support; high military
                            officials are even hopeful that Frei would act as a front for any
                            government they might set up. How the increasingly current rumors of
                            these developments will affect the prospects for a leftist front is at
                            present not clear.</p>

                        <p>19. Much of course could happen in the next year to undermine
                            Alessandri’s present lead, including a setback to his health. A strong
                            left coalition, should one emerge, would present a formidable challenge.
                            For the present it is significant that Alessandri’s political ascent
                            seems to have thrown the traditional parties into disarray. Even before
                            the March election, a sense of defeatism crept into the ranks of the
                            Christian Democrats. In January a bill proposed by the Frei government
                            which would have given future presidents the power, once in a
                            presidential term, to dissolve Congress and call for a new election was
                            defeated by the abstention of thirty Christian Democrats who feared that
                            Alessandri not <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> would be
                            the first to implement it.</p>
                        <p>20. To some extent, the outcome of the election will be influenced by the
                            country’s economic performance. Part of the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss>’s malaise and the improving fortunes of rival political
                            forces can be attributed to the worsening economic problems of the last
                            two years. The costs of social reforms and the growing political turmoil
                            have had a detrimental short-term effect on the economy. These economic
                            problems in turn prohibit a continuation of the rapid social gains of
                            the early Frei years and place severe constraints on the government’s
                            ability to fulfill the popular expectations stimulated by his own
                            “revolutionary” program. Already beset by both economic stagnation and
                            rapid inflation, the administration has found its range of policy
                            options further limited by the effects of a prolonged drought. As the
                            election approaches, the government will be even more tempted to follow
                            expansionary fiscal and monetary policies than in the past, but the
                            resulting increase in the pace of inflation could have serious political
                            consequences. In sum, the administration will be forced to choose among
                            unpalatable alternatives—none is likely to greatly boost its political
                            fortunes.</p>
                        <p>21. The diffusion that marks the present pre-election scene is in vivid
                            contrast to the polarization between the Marxist left and the center
                            left and right that characterized the period before the 1964 election.
                            Then the fear of a Marxist president combined with the fresh appeal of
                            the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> gave Frei his comfortable
                            majority. Now uneasiness over the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>’s
                            performance and the inability of the established parties to provide an
                            alternative merely enhances the appeal of Alessandri as a sort of
                            political <hi rend="italic">patrón</hi>, an estate manager who remains
                            aloof from party politics.</p>
                        <p>22. Yet Alessandri’s growing popularity probably does not mean that Chile
                            is swinging in any very definite or permanent way from a leftward to a
                            rightward trend. Alessandri’s appeal is probably more personal than
                            ideological in that he evokes a traditional “strongman” image. His
                            polling strength has been estimated to be about 30 to 40 percent at the
                            electorate. This in itself poses nagging questions as to his <pb n="43"
                                facs="0083" xml:id="pg_43"/>tenure and the future of the
                            constitutional system as well should he win a plurality. As elections in
                            which no candidate receives a majority are thrown into Congress, would
                            the present Congress, which is dominated by forces of the center left
                            and left, confirm the wishes of the rightist minority that gave
                            Alessandri his plurality—especially if it were a spare one? If Congress
                            voted against Alessandri, would the military stage a coup on his
                            behalf?</p>
                        <p>23. It is a fair assumption that even a hostile Congress (especially one
                            threatened by a military coup) would not attempt to nullify an
                            Alessandri victory, if one came to pass, and jeopardize the
                            constitutional system. Assuming an orderly succession, Alessandri still
                            would face a troubled tenure. Economic problems would be intensified by
                            pre-election spending and he would be likely to come into office with no
                            clear mandate for any specific policy other than “cleaning up the mess
                            in Santiago.” He would inherit the present Congress (at least until
                            elections in 1973) in which he has little support and incurs much
                            animosity for his contempt of politicians. Because of this latter trait
                            Alessandri has furthermore aroused suspicions that he intends somehow to
                            rule without Congress and with the military.</p>
                        <p>24. Although he apparently has no intention of overturning the social
                            programs of the Frei government, Alessandri, if he gains office, would
                            probably be under pressure to do so by his conservative backers. At the
                            same time Alessandri as president could not help but be caught up in the
                            demands for continued evolutionary or revolutionary change. Such demands
                            are evoked by parties or groups that may be presently divided and at
                            odds but nonetheless continue to represent a large proportion of the
                            Chilean electorate. How all of this would affect his style of government
                            is difficult to say at present, but he and other Chileans would probably
                            soon find out that the estate had changed considerably since Don Jorge
                            turned over the keys five years ago.</p>

                        <p rend="center">THE CHILEAN MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT</p>
                        <p>Chile’s armed forces are reputed to be among the most apolitical in Latin
                            America. They have not actively intervened in the government since 1932,
                            a record equaled in few other countries in the hemisphere. The armed
                            forces as well as the police are respected for their professional
                            attitude and capability, although deficiencies in training and equipment
                            are becoming more pronounced.</p>
                        <p>As a result of its financial difficulties, the government has not
                            provided much modern equipment for the armed forces. Some officers are
                            beginning to view this as an indication that the civilian government is
                            indifferent to the military requirements of the country and of the
                            fighting forces. Furthermore, some conservative officers are concerned
                            that a Communist-supported candidate may be elected in the presidential
                            election next year, and that such a development could provoke
                            intervention by neighboring countries. Younger officers are being
                            influenced by actions of the armed forces in Argentina and Peru. There
                            is growing talk, therefore, of increasing the military’s influence over
                            the government.</p>
                        <p rend="center">HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</p>
                        <p>During colonial times the army was the mainstay of the government.
                            Because of the army’s small size, a militia was developed to supplement
                            the regular army. Most of the militia officers were young native-born
                            colonials, and the militia was an important factor in the struggle for
                            independence.</p>
                        <p>Chile maintained a relatively democratic political system until 1924. At
                            that time, disgusted with the country’s economic situation and with
                            extensive political bickering, a group of conservative generals
                            dissolved Congress and forced the resignation of the president,
                                <persName corresp="#p_APA_1">Arturo Alessandri</persName>. Early the
                            next year a more liberal group, led by Colonels Carlos Ibanez and
                            Marmaduke Grove, led a coup against the conserva<pb n="45" facs="0085"
                                xml:id="pg_45"/>tive junta and brought Alessandri back to serve out
                            the remainder of his term. During 1926 and 1927 Ibanez became concerned
                            about the inefficient way the government was being run, and in the 1927
                            election he managed to win the presidency. Coping with the effects of
                            the depression, which hit Chile very hard, was too much for him,
                            however, and he resigned in 1931. A spokesman for the oligarchy was
                            elected to replace him. In June 1932 Grove, by now head of the air
                            force, led a coup that established a “socialist republic.” Twelve days
                            later he was overthrown by a conservative military group. An election
                            was held in October, and <persName corresp="#p_APA_1">Arturo
                                Alessandri</persName> was again elected president. After this time,
                            the military remained out of politics. In fact, a “republican militia”
                            backed by respected elements in society and politics was formed to make
                            sure that the armed forces confined new activities strictly to military
                            matters.</p>
                        <p>Since the 1930s the Chilean armed forces have been concerned primarily
                            with what they see as a threat from Argentina and with improving their
                            internal security capability. Only in recent years have salary
                            difficulties and increasing internal security problems caused them to
                            renew their active interests in politics. Many Chileans look upon the
                            1927–32 period as one of aberration in the face of economic disaster and
                            believe that an apolitical military establishment is the only possible
                            system for their country.</p>
                        <p rend="center">COMPOSITION AND CAPABILITIES</p>
                        <p>The Chilean armed forces are among the most competent and professional in
                            Latin America. There are 23,000 men in the army, 14,000 in the navy, and
                            10,000 in the air force. The carabineros, or national police force, have
                            24,000 men. The armed forces’ equipment, however, is for the most part
                            obsolescent. This situation is responsible for some of the most bitter
                            complaints by the younger officers against the government. They see the
                            Argentine armed forces receiving modern weapons and fear that these
                            weapons may one day be turned against Chile.</p>
                        <p>The air force in 1966 began a program of purchasing subsonic Hawker
                            Hunter aircraft from Great Britain. The air force would like to buy
                                <gloss target="#t_F5_1">F–5</gloss>s from the United States, but
                            budgetary considerations and the prospect of a cutoff of US economic aid
                            if such equipment is bought have delayed any such negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The navy, too, is plagued by aging equipment. Although it carries two
                            submarines in its inventory, one is in overhaul and the other is in only
                            slightly better condition. Argentina’s purchase in 1968 of an aircraft
                            carrier of World War II vintage triggered considerable uneasiness in the
                            Chilean Navy.</p>
                        <p>The carabineros are a professional national police force of extremely
                            high standards. They probably would be able to contain civil
                            disturbances, even if these were widespread. If the unrest continued <pb
                                n="46" facs="0086" xml:id="pg_46"/>over a long period, however, they
                            probably would be forced to call on the army for help. The army recently
                            has been increasing its internal security capability, but it is still
                            likely to rely more on firepower than on less drastic riot-control
                            techniques.</p>

                        <p>Although the armed forces have remained out of the political mainstream,
                            they are very much a part of Chilean life. They are entitled by law to a
                            percentage of the revenues from the copper industry. Many military
                            officers are bitter because they claim that they have not been receiving
                            this money and that, in fact, the government owes the armed forces a
                            great deal of money.</p>
                        <p>In addition to these budgetary privileges, the military courts have
                            certain judicial prerogatives that are regularly exercised. Military
                            courts have jurisdiction over civilians who abuse the military as an
                            institution, abuse individuals because they are members of the military,
                            or insult the national flag. They also have jurisdiction over crimes
                            against the military whether committed by military or civilian
                            personnel. In 1968, a Socialist senator was convicted of insulting the
                            military and was jailed for some time. A newspaper director was also
                            jailed briefly. Such actions do not cause much outcry, even among
                            Chileans who are most conscious of their civil liberties.</p>
                        <p rend="center">CHANGING POLITICAL ATMOSPHERE</p>
                        <p>Although the armed forces have become increasingly sensitive to the
                            political situation in Chile, they have not yet broken with their tra<pb
                                n="47" facs="0087" xml:id="pg_47"/>ditional stance of avoiding
                            unconstitutional acts and direct political involvement. A substantial
                            number of higher ranking officers believe, however, that
                            extraconstitutional change will become necessary to break the current
                            stalemate between the executive and legislative branches. They also
                            believe that the military should be given a greater voice in the
                            formation of foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>Another important factor contributing to the military uneasiness is the
                            possibility that a Communist-supported candidate such as pro-<persName
                                corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName> Socialist <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Salvador Allende</persName> could win the
                            presidential election scheduled for September 1970. It is possible that
                            if the Socialists, Communists, and Radicals could combine in an
                            electoral coalition, and if the candidate of this coalition were clearly
                            leading the field, the military might undertake a coup. Such a move
                            would be most likely to come before the election, to avoid the
                            appearance of deliberately flouting the popular will.</p>
                        <p>This sentiment for action against a leftist government is by no means
                            held universally within the armed forces. Many officers are reluctant to
                            undertake the task of government themselves. In addition, they believe
                            that they could not be much worse off under a leftist government than
                            they are now. Military men holding such opinions probably would take a
                            wait-and-see attitude toward the government. Younger officers, in
                            particular, are more likely to respond to leftist ideology and thus
                            would be more willing to accept a leftist president unless he ignored
                            the sad state of equipment and training in the Chilean armed forces or
                            moved overtly against military institutions and traditions.</p>
                        <p>Events in neighboring countries are having an influence in Chile. The
                            military take-overs in Brazil, Argentina, and Peru have given many
                            Chilean officers food for thought. They see these governments attempting
                            reforms without being hampered by political bickering; they wonder if
                            similar methods might work in Chile.</p>
                        <p>There are reports that representatives of the Brazilian and Argentine
                            armed forces have talked with their Chilean counterparts in the hope of
                            influencing them toward a more interventionist attitude. Argentine
                            leaders are known to be concerned that a far-leftist government might
                            come to power in Chile. In fact, some Argentine officers believe that
                            even the Frei government is much too leftist for comfort. This attitude
                            has convinced some Chilean officers that if <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> or a similar candidate were elected and allowed
                            to take office, his government would be threatened by Argentine military
                            action, on the pretext of an incident along the long, ill-defined Andean
                            border. With this fear in mind, they might favor moving against a
                            leftist government to avoid the threat of Argentine action, which would
                            consolidate public support for whatever government was in power in Chile
                            at the time.</p>

                        <p>Many military officers believe that former president <persName
                                corresp="#p_ARJ_1">Jorge Alessandri</persName> would be an excellent
                            person to head a military backed government. Alessandri is presently in
                            a very strong position with respect to the presidential race and could
                            win a plurality of the votes next year. If no candidate wins a majority,
                            however, congress decides between the two top vote-getters. Should
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> be the runner-up,
                            the leftist congressmen might vote for <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>. Under these conditions, the military well might
                            step in to install Alessandri as president.</p>
                        <p>A restraining factor in any military action against the government is the
                            lack of strong leadership at the top. In addition, the assistance, or at
                            least the acquiescence, of the carabineros would be essential to any
                            successful coup.</p>
                        <p rend="center">INTERNAL SECURITY PROBLEMS</p>
                        <p>The increase in terrorism and violence has begun to worry both the
                            military and the carabineros very seriously. Should there be any
                            widespread breakdown of public order, the military might well feel
                            compelled to take direct action. The extent of the military’s concern is
                            indicated by a memorandum circulated within the army in June 1969. This
                            document warned that insurgency is expected at any time after July 1969
                            and could take place in widely separated areas. Senior officers are
                            warned to take extra precautions to avoid being kidnaped by subversive
                            elements.</p>
                        <p>During the past 12 months subversion, including both street riots and
                            isolated acts of terrorism, has risen markedly. Opposition elements have
                            increased their ability to create civil disorders. These activities have
                            been led by the youth wings of the Communist and Socialist parties and
                            the extremist Movement of the Revolutionary Left, which is suspected of
                            being the paramilitary arm of the Socialist Party.</p>
                        <p>In June two terrorist bases were discovered—a “guerrilla training school”
                            in the Santiago area and an arms cache farther south. Bombs, weapons,
                            and maps of military bases and other strategic locations were <pb n="49"
                                facs="0089" xml:id="pg_49"/>found at both sites along with evidence
                            that the Socialist Party was heavily involved.</p>
                        <p>This development would increase the armed forces’ concern—and possibly
                            their willingness to intervene—if the Socialist candidate appears to be
                            winning the presidential election.</p>
                        <p rend="center">OUTLOOK</p>
                        <p>As the presidential election nears, reports of military plotting against
                            the Chilean Government are certain to increase. To some extent the
                            military will simply be indulging in the time-honored Latin American
                            practice of keeping an eye on the civilian politicians. It seems
                            probable, however, that widespread public disorder coupled with a strong
                            leftist candidacy could provide the spark that would impel the military
                            to move into the government.</p>
                        <p>Such action could take a number of forms. The military might form a junta
                            such as the Peruvian armed forces did after their coup in October 1968.
                            They would be more likely, however, to find a prominent civilian to run
                            the government, drawing on technical expertise to undertake the
                            necessary reforms. Frei reportedly has been approached, but has flatly
                            refused to be party to such an action.</p>
                        <p>Violence will continue to be a problem, especially if the government
                            attempts to hold down on wage increases to combat the soaring inflation.
                            In addition, Socialist provocateurs could take advantage of rural
                            grievances over land reform delays to carry out more “invasions” of land
                            holdings. It was under similar circumstances that eight people were
                            killed last March in Puerto Montt, causing serious political
                            repercussions.</p>
                        <p>The provocation for a coup in Chile would have to be relatively grave,
                            considering the weight of tradition that is on the side of
                            constitutionality. Nevertheless, the apolitical nature of the Chilean
                            armed forces can no longer be taken for granted. <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>1. Summary: After eight months of thundering boredom that served
                            primarily to align the committed, the Chilean Presidential campaign has
                            finally entered that final phase in which the uncommitted 15 to 20
                            percent of the electorate are in the driver’s seat. Although the current
                            lineup of Alessandri, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> appears to be
                            congealing into that ranking, there is, at least theoretically, time to
                            juggle the order. Increasingly, it is the present President that is
                            emerging as a quasi-contender; the three candidates being what they
                            unfortunately are, <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Eduardo
                            Frei</persName>’s comparative stature and influence grow daily. Since
                            law and order dominated the electoral events and effluences of the past
                            month, and since that issue revolves around governmental behavior, a
                            lame duck can paddle up a froth of apologies or set his tail churning
                            for solid shore. Frei has clearly decided to be purposeful [garble]
                            consequently, the Presidential race for 1970 is taking on the appearance
                            of the 1964 contest between Frei and <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> with Alessandri at this time the obvious
                            beneficiary. (End summary)</p>
                        <p>2. “Shall we have a convulsed or tranquil republic,” de Toqueville asked
                            of France almost a century and a half ago. This question now dominates
                            the Presidential campaign. It is the issue that has propelled Frei
                            directly into the competition for ballots. All previous elections in
                            Chile had their quotas of violence; the novelty in the current campaign
                                <pb n="51" facs="0091" xml:id="pg_51"/>is that there is one group
                            (the MIR), small in number but with a not insignificant layer of
                            sympathetic support in the Socialist Party, that is opposed to holding
                            elections. It is far less the MIR’s still modest activities than the
                            responses to them of the parties and of the factions within parties that
                            has shoved the law and order issue to the polemical forefront in the
                            remaining 45 days of the campaign.</p>
                        <p>3. From the start, the Alessandri forces have sought what is called here
                            the “violence” issue. Given a septuagenarian candidate without a
                            program, at least none that is worthy of the name, and without a party,
                            at least none (the Nacional) that he was willing to admit as his own,
                            his shrewder supporters reckoned that any hope of broad mass appeal
                            rested on the transfiguration of their palsied candidate into a
                            patriarchal figure. To accomplish this metamorphosis in which Alessandri
                            would be presented as the above-party restorer of serenity, the menace
                            of violence and of convulsion was indispensable.</p>
                        <p>4. Left to their own devices, these Alessandristas would have continued
                            to contrive clumsy provocations of the type that had their standard
                            bearer venture in March into the strongest holds of Marxism such as the
                            coal mining district. When one such foray led to a clash and to the
                            stoning of Alessandri’s (empty) auto, his backers in the media kicked
                            the violence gong. Even if I were to assume that Alessandri’s physique
                            and spirit could tolerate more such escapades, this tactic could hardly
                            suffice to provoke a meaningful response, particularly from the highest
                            priority target group, the women.</p>
                        <p>5. It was the followers of Che and of Fidel, the well-educated and
                            romantically inclined sons and daughters of the bourgeoisie who comprise
                            the MIR, who fell in with the plans of the Alessandristas. Committed to
                            revolution, this mod squad of Marxist delinquents set out to “convulse”
                            the country and to do in both <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>. A couple of bank robberies, a few powerful bomb
                            explosions and some similar noisy but harmless derring-do the past two
                            months drew the desired headlines. The police added to the bubble of
                            words by stumbling across a guerrilla training camp in the south. The
                            death of two high school students in Santiago in deliberate provocations
                            of the police brought the “violence” controversy to a boil.</p>
                        <p>6. The Communists, <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> were of one outraged
                            and negative mind. Violence could only benefit Alessandri; violence
                            could only disrupt their electoral tactics; violence could only divide
                            their followers.</p>
                        <p>7. The <gloss target="#t_PCCh_1">PCCh</gloss>, with its memories still
                            fresh of its experience as an illegal and persecuted party, with its
                            dread of a repressive military regime and with its conviction that the
                            constitutional process offers it and the Soviets the most dividends, was
                            clamped into an unwelcome bind. The party had just negotiated a modus
                            vivendi with <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName> after
                                <pb n="52" facs="0092" xml:id="pg_52"/>months of effort in Moscow in
                            the hopes of keeping the <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> and
                            sympathetic Socialists in docile line until the elections. It had
                            steadfastly rejected <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            pleas for funds so that at the minimum the <gloss target="#t_PCCh_1"
                                >PCCh</gloss> alone would grow by its energetic efforts to register
                            and to influence workers, campesinos, and intellectuals. The <gloss
                                target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> tactic exposed the fundamental breach
                            between Communists and Socialists, particularly that majority of the
                                <gloss target="#t_PS_1">PS</gloss>Central Committee that is
                            hard-line revolutionary, anti-Moscow and anti-<persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. Even more significant in
                            electoral terms, violence alienated the weakest link in the Popular
                            Front, the Radical Party, whose clientele is the biggest swing element
                            of the electorate. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> was
                            forced to disown the <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> publicly. But
                            he and the Communists could not disavow the Socialist insistence to
                            exploit the violence by a general strike last week, a tactic that failed
                            miserably, that produced abrasive recriminations within the Popular
                            Unity camp and that briefly united the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and the
                            Alessandristas.</p>
                        <p>8. For <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>, violence was no less a damaging
                            issue. The ex-Ambassador to Washington has predicated his campaign on an
                            appeal to the left, on his de facto rebaptism of his party as “the
                            Christian left” and on his assumption that he will be elected President
                            by the Congress and govern thereafter with Communist cooperation. His
                            vision of a new society incorporates the beliefs that Chile today is not
                            only inefficient because of its neo-capitalist structure but unjust
                            because of its “institutionalized violence”. This latter term is an echo
                            from many Roman Catholic as well as Marxist documents and refers both to
                            the imperfect distribution of income and [garble] and to police and
                            armed forces that maintain these legalized asymmetries. In the crunch
                            over “violence”, <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>, who is
                            anything but inconsistent, stuck to his guns; he hammered at
                            institutionalized violence while seeking to avoid an open split with the
                            Frei govt. While paying homage to the high reputation of Chile’s
                            carabineros, he implicitly blamed Frei for not avoiding violence and
                            pressed this past weekend for the removal of the head of the carabineros
                            and the Minister of Interior.</p>
                        <p>9. Frei rejected the demand and continued the subtle but no less steady
                            drift from <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> and his
                            platform. Following up the June nationwide TV-radio denunciation by the
                                <gloss target="#t_MinJust_1">MinInterior</gloss> of <gloss
                                target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> and rpt [<hi rend="italic">PR</hi>]
                            and Socialists for provoking violence, Frei in his northern tour last
                            week rejected in toto the institutionalized violence theory to
                            concentrate his fire on the provocateurs and to emphasize that his govt
                            was going to maintain law and order by conventional means albeit without
                            seeking confrontations. More interesting for its political impact is the
                            stress that Frei is giving to “liberty” and to “democracy”, the two
                            words that distinguish his party and his philosophy clearly from that of
                            Marxist-Leninists and the two words that <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName> won’t employ against <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> or the Communists.</p>
                        <pb n="53" facs="0093" xml:id="pg_53"/>
                        <p>10. These plays within plays have offered that singular character
                            Alessandri the chance to slip into the role he has long been seeking.
                            “Alessandri is tranquility” is the slogan that is heard on all radio
                            stations. To this has been added a massive publicity drive that the
                            Communists call the campaign of terror and the Nacionales term the
                            campaign of truth. Its message is simple: that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> means a Communist regime in
                            Chile. This ploy provided Frei a big majority over <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> in 1964 and every Chilean
                            political group is agreed that this fear is a powerful dissuader to the
                            two groups that will determine the outcome of this election—the women
                            and the Radical clientele. (End Part I)</p>

                        <p>1. Ever since Machiavelli argued the distinction that half of men’s
                            actions were ruled by chance and half by men themselves, most of us have
                            consciously sought to change that balance. For politicians, the
                            interplay between Machiavelli’s fortuna and virtu—a crude anticipation
                            of the Freudian trinity of id, ego and super-ego—is most evident at
                            election-time.</p>
                        <p>2. It has been my belief, not at all shared unanimously, that any
                            Christian Democrat could have easily won this election. All he needed as
                            tactics, whatever his eventual program, were (A) the polemical dismissal
                            of a 74 year old opponent as an absurd proposition (B) a firm hold on
                            Frei’s coat-tails (C) the pledge of still more rational reforms and (D)
                            a conscious distinction between Revolution in Liberty, the Frei win<pb
                                n="54" facs="0094" xml:id="pg_54"/>ning slogan and revolution. Given
                            the unanimous finding of all 1970 polls that a majority of Chileans
                            regard the accomplishments of the Frei administration as better than
                            average, given the incontrovertible evidences of Frei’s unique
                            popularity today and given the traditional Chilean proclivity to bestow
                            sympathy on their outgoing leaders, the President, although a lame duck,
                            was, by luck and chance, the trump ace in the electoral game. This
                            judgment is essential to any understanding of what is transpiring.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> is increasingly viewed
                            by all sectors of opinion as a poor third in the race. Indeed some of
                            his downcast supporters have told us they are concerned for the future
                            of party and of Chile because they fear he may not even draw 750,000 of
                            the 3 million expected votes. The question that perplexes most analysts
                            is why a candidate that was doubtlessly beginning to hit on all
                            cylinders only two months ago (see #2 in this series) could so ruinously
                            strip his gears. One possible lengthy explanation follows.</p>
                        <p>4. From the time I met <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>
                            three years ago until today he has clung unwaveringly to these
                            assumptions:</p>
                        <p>A. <persName corresp="#p_ARJ_1">Alessandri</persName> would never stick
                            out the campaign.</p>
                        <p>B. The Frei regime was basically a failure, or at best a transition,
                            because it was seeking to reform rather than overturn an inherently
                            rotten system.</p>
                        <p>C. Efficiency, including an end to the 80-year disease of high inflation
                            and the beginning of consistent dynamic growth, required mass
                            participation and mass discipline which, in turn, could only come from
                            the active cooperation of the potent Communists and, perhaps, a sector
                            of Socialists.</p>
                        <p>D. He alone could bring about the three “miracles” that would transform
                            Chile—the understanding of the US that a society somewhat like
                            Yugoslavia’s is in the US interest, the sympathy of the Soviet Union
                            because such a society would end US hegemony and capitalism, and finally
                            the cooperation of the Communists.</p>
                        <p>5. Although <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> had always
                            maintained too that he would not be a candidate unless he was assured
                            the support of the “popular parties,” the stinging rebuffs of the
                            Communists and Socialists persuaded him only to alter his condition to
                            that of the “popular forces.” He reasoned that this semantical
                            modification was of ephemeral insignificance since he would surely be
                            elected—without alienating the popular “forces”—and since he would enact
                            a program that would be bound to forge a working arrangement with the
                            Communists. Moreover he calculated that even if Alessandri remained in
                            the race, his assumptions would compel the Marxist parties to vote for
                            him in a congressional runoff with the ex-President.</p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="0095" xml:id="pg_55"/>
                        <p>6. The fact that the US Embassy did not rpt not at any time demonstrate
                            any hostility or concern to <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName> led him to conclude that his first “miracle” had
                            been achieved. The neutrality of the Soviet Embassy, the cultural
                            accords signed by the Frei govt with Moscow and the manifest Soviet
                            pleasure with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_VSG_1"
                                >Valdes</persName>’ “opening to Cuba” persuaded <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> that the second miracle had been
                            fulfilled and that the third was only a matter of time. Reports from
                            well-placed <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>ers in the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and in the provinces that the
                            Communists were listlessly going through the motions of an <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> campaign convinced <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>, who was exultantly pulling
                            grass-roots crowds, that he had been omniscient.</p>
                        <p>7. For his part Frei threw the enormous resources of the govt into the
                                <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> campaign. Funds were
                            made available; inflation was braked by incredible effort to its present
                            level of “only” 23.7 percent; inaugurations were timed to spotlight the
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>’s accomplishments; a public
                            love feast between Frei and <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName> was held after the President’s final State of the
                            Union message which, incidentally, came close to endorsing <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>; foreign policy actions
                            punctuated the harmony. The <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> was
                            unified despite the profound divisions between its right (Frei) and left
                                (<persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>) wings and the 30
                            percent that had voted for the party in 1969’s congressional elections
                            was back in the fold.</p>
                        <p>8. Euphoria blinded <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>. He
                            ignored his vulnerability as a candidate who looks like a banker, talks
                            like an archbishop and preaches “revolution.” He dismissed the
                            fundamental antipathy of a great many Chileans to the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>, to the same arrogance that underlies
                            much of <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>’s performance. He
                            misunderstood the strength of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>, the commitment to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> of the Communists, the attraction of the
                            bread-and-butter promises of the Popular Front and thus, miscalculated
                            disastrously the calculus of Chilean variables.</p>
                        <p>9. If <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is strong, there is
                            a far stronger, much more primitive fear of violent disruption of life
                            that translates into anti-Communism and preference for progressive
                            change. What distinguishes Chile in Latin America is its very high
                            degree of civility. It is civility that makes Frei so popular, that
                            provides Chile such magnified international leverage and that makes
                            “violence” such a litmus issue. Social engineers such as <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> and a great many economists and
                            political scientists with one preferred model, cannot quantify such
                            intangibles as civility and therefore rarely perceive the real world in
                            which they live.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> and the Marxist parties
                            make much of the 35 deaths that have occurred from police and army
                            confrontations with strikers or demonstrators in the almost six years of
                            Frei administration. By any hemispheric measure, that total is low. Yet
                            the Marxists seek to exploit it as rightist repression and <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> blames the system. Both
                            understand the average Chilean’s outrage to any violence. At the same
                            time they <pb n="56" facs="0096" xml:id="pg_56"/>unconsciously defy the
                            civility that provokes such outrage by ignoring the obverse side of
                            civility—a strong desire to avoid convulsion. They also forget when they
                            attack carabineros that almost all Chileans desire more not less police
                            for personal protection.</p>
                        <p>11. Violence cum anti-Communism put the already stalled <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> drive (see #3 in this series)
                            into reverse. <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> chose to
                            equivocate over violence and to continue his wooing of the left.
                            Alessandri who had made every mistake in the book suddenly was handed a
                            second chance.</p>
                        <p>12. The campaign requisites that had imposed mutual tolerance on Frei and
                                <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> no longer held sway.
                            Frei was not about to accept culpability for student deaths; he was not
                            at all disposed to accept a theory of institutionalized violence that
                            would have made a mockery of his six years in office. On the contrary he
                            reckoned that unless he moved to the offensive against the Marxists, not
                            only he but <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> would suffer grievously. To admit
                            guilt would be to endorse <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> has thus far held to
                            his assumptions. The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> have sought to divide the Popular
                            Front by various polemics. But there has been no attack yet by <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> on <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> or on the real nature of Communist plans.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> has thus converted the
                            center terrain he held as a <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>
                            candidate into a waffle iron. And as this notion has spread, a steady
                            drift towards polarization between Alessandri and <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has also occurred.</p>
                        <p>14. Alessandri has exploited his new life by defending law and order, by
                            dismissing <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> as a serious
                            contender (instead of responding to his every charge), by hammering on
                            his above-parties position, by comparing prices in his regime with
                            today, by keeping open all options except “convulsion” and by being
                            himself—a crotchety independent patriarch. His supporters have for six
                            weeks mounted a tremendous anti-Communism media campaign. No rpt no
                            candidate is mentioned but <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName> each have attacked the campaign as one of
                            “terror”—the Communist term—and have blamed the supporters of
                            Alessandri. One of <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>’s
                            brain-trusts is promoting a congressional investigation. The Nacionales
                            have quickly reposted by saying they regard the campaign as one of
                            “truth” and de facto assume responsibility. Moreover they are recalling
                            that it was the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> who benefitted from
                            such a campaign in 1964 and they are also ventilating sub rosa threats
                            of looking into <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>’s
                            financing.</p>
                        <p>15. With Frei mildly echoing the anti-Communist theme, the Marxists are
                            accusing him of aligning himself to Alessandri and to North Americans.
                            While there have been a few mentions of the Embassy and while the <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> receives a modest amount of publicity
                            in leftist-spheres, a more recent and subtle line is being floated by
                            the best of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s stable. In
                            brief, it says US Embassy reps have for some time <pb n="57" facs="0097"
                                xml:id="pg_57"/>stated their lack of confidence in Alessandri’s
                            capacity to govern in tranquillity; these same reps have told the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> that <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName> cannot win without separating himself from the
                            leftist forces; since the US has no faith in either Alessandri or
                                <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> and feels <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is going to win, it is obvious
                            that the US is planning a military coup. Since a coup is the least
                            likely of all eventualities (although genuinely feared by the <gloss
                                target="#t_PCCh_1">PCCh</gloss>) this propagation by the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> camp of our electoral
                            neutrality is, in the circumstances, the best we can hope from a
                            candidate and a group that has proclaimed US imperialism as the enemy in
                            Latin America.</p>
                        <p>16. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s declaration that he
                            will join with <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName> in a
                            revolutionary hemispheric effort and that he will, by legal means, bring
                            to Chile the same kind of structure as Cuba’s, is an offering to
                            Alessandri’s altar. Again, <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>
                            prefers not to hear or deal with it and so his political asexuality is
                            reinforced for many.</p>
                        <p>17. However since Frei is not only the first Christian Democratic
                            President of this hemisphere and founder of the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> but also the victor over <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> and the unshakeable enemy of Marxism-Leninism,
                            he is increasingly being targetted by the left. He is also being blamed
                            sotto voce by the <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> camp
                            within the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> for the unpromising
                            situation of their candidate. The Marxists want to use Frei to split the
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> and some <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>ers want him to be the scapegoat. My
                            own view is that Frei wants <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> to finish third; that he wants the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> to do well and that he has sought in
                            his way to help; that he has decided that <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName>’s pigheadedness has put him on the margin of an
                            increasing polarization and that in such circumstances, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> must be stopped.</p>
                        <p>18. The net effect is that whereas #2 in this series was <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>’s, #3 <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s, the past month has been
                            Alessandri’s who has gained from both the polarization and <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>’s retrogression. The defection
                            of another Radical Deputy (Samuel Fuentes) to Alessandri is probably the
                            harbinger of more and bigger such shifts from <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>; it is noteworthy that the
                            respected Radical Senator Juliet this week undercut <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> bread and butter promises by
                            stating that obviously no govt could fund them. Another straw is that
                                <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> is running out of
                            money, that demands for payment on large advances are now being heard
                            and that he has less radio time for the moment than either of the other
                            two. Another is that in two nearby agricultural communities, a very
                            clear shift from <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> to
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> among campesinos has
                            just occurred, the explanation being that they do not wish to waste
                            their vote on a loser. Another is the field trip report of an Emb
                            officer which confirms a very marked upward movement in the Alessandri
                            column in Concepcion Province; and perhaps most interesting of all, has
                            been the enormous turnout for Alessandri this past week in the Anaconda
                            mine area (both at Chuqui and at nearby Calama); a Chilean newspaper
                            friend says Alessandri will poll very well there.</p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="0098" xml:id="pg_58"/>
                        <p>19. In sum, Alessandri is perhaps at the 38–39 mark now, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> at the 33 and <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> at the 25. If Alessandrista
                            over-confidence does not reappear, if <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName> does not change tactics and if no chance event
                            upsets the present pattern, there is a probability that Alessandri will
                            get the sizeable vote he needs to assume office without undue difficulty
                            and that, as the wiseacres here say, <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName> will be displaced as third by Senor Nulo
                            Blanco.</p>
                        <p>20. One final comment on fortuna and virtu or id and ego. In <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s case it is hardly
                            advantageous to fall into a defensive posture against the “terror
                            campaign;” the Communists understand the trap and are seeking, as the
                            effective Popular Front radio ads do, to concentrate on bread and butter
                            themes. But <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is more and
                            more adopting a whining and petulant tone that is not doing him any
                            good. In <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>’s case, he has
                            always articulated his fundamental differences with Frei in intellectual
                            terms. But most informed Chileans believe he is suffering from the
                            one-two syndrome; he has always been second to Frei and it galls him. It
                            is this visceral element that has contributed so much to his
                            programmatic fixations and to his electoral situation. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>, by chance, are men.</p>

                        <p>1. The administration of <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Eduardo
                                Frei</persName> took office in November 1964 amid widespread
                            expressions of support for its declared program of “Revolution in
                            Liberty.” Its goal was to pursue far-reaching socio-economic reforms
                            while preserving democratic liberties and institutions. The
                            administration’s efforts in housing, education, and agrarian reform,
                            including rural unionization, were designed to expand the active
                            electorate and to increase social and economic benefits to Chile’s urban
                            and rural poor. In fact, the growth in real income and social services
                            for these groups has moved them toward fuller participation in national
                            life. Frei’s programs have, however, come too fast for some elements of
                            society and too slowly for others. They have been costly, politically as
                            well as economically.</p>
                        <p>2. While implementing its reforms, the Frei administration saw its
                            financial situation substantially assisted by three developments:
                            record-breaking copper prices averaging almost twice those prevailing in
                            the early 1960s, foreign assistance averaging nearly $200 million
                            annually, and a sizeable inflow of private investment capital. The
                            latter resulted from the agreements made with three US copper companies
                            in 1967, which promised a favorable tax and investment policy over a
                            20-year period in exchange for the companies’ participation in a major
                            expansion program designed to double the production of copper. The Frei
                            administration obtained additional benefits in 1969 by a phased
                            nationalization of Anaconda’s producing mines and by substantially
                            raising tax rates on all major foreign copper companies, actions which
                            effectively ended the 1967 agreements.<note n="2" xml:id="d11fn2">With
                                their $560 million expansion programs nearing completion and under a
                                continuing threat of immediate expropriation, the companies had
                                little choice but to go along with the government’s escalating tax
                                and equity demands. See Tables I and II of the Appendix for a
                                summary of changes in Chile’s tax revenue shares and foreign
                                exchange earnings from US copper company operations resulting from
                                “Chileanization” (1967) and “nationalization” (1969). [Footnote is
                                in the original.]</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. The aforementioned factors enabled Chile to show a substantial surplus
                            on its balance of payments in all but one year of the Frei
                            administration, even with imports at a fairly high level. As a result,
                            Chile’s net international reserve position improved from a negative $240
                            million in 1964 to a positive $220 million in 1969. During the same
                            period, however, the foreign debt of the public sector doubled, reaching
                            a total of $1.2 billion. Moreover, Chile became even more dependent on
                            copper exports, whose share of export earnings increased from 65 percent
                            of the total in 1964 to 80 percent in 1969. (See Appendix for Figure 1:
                            “The Role of Copper in Chile’s Exports, 1960–1969.”)</p>

                        <p>4. Increased revenues from both external and domestic sources have
                            assisted in the initiation of programs aimed at improving the way of
                            life of the nation’s lower classes. Some of Frei’s most impressive
                            accomplishments have been in the field of education, where enrollment
                            has increased nearly 50 percent, and the rate of illiteracy has been
                            further reduced from some 16 percent in 1964 to about 11 percent in
                            1969. Even though he has not met his stated goals in other fields, such
                            as housing and agrarian reform, his administration has made substantial
                            progress despite the obstructionist tactics of his political opponents.
                            Since Frei’s program for expropriating and redistributing land did not
                            receive congressional approval until July 1967, he had little chance of
                            providing the 100,000 new, family-sized farms he called for during his
                            election campaign. The costs of the program have been far higher than
                            anticipated, and have held down the pace of land reform. Nevertheless,
                            by the end of Frei’s administration, about 25,000 landless families will
                            have been settled—albeit on communal rather than individually-owned
                            farms. (See Appendix for Table III—“Agrarian Reform in Chile.”) In
                            addition, his administration is exceeding the notable achievement of his
                            predecessor, <persName corresp="#p_ARJ_1">Jorge Alessandri</persName>,
                            in the construction of urgently needed housing.</p>
                        <p>5. One of the striking changes under Frei has been in the status of rural
                            labor. Until Frei took power, the unionization of agricultural workers
                            was so severely handicapped by legislation that there were but 24 rural
                            unions with a total membership of just over 1,600. By August 1969 there
                            were 469 rural unions with over 100,000 members. By May 1970, the rural
                            unions were claiming a membership of some 155,000. As a result of
                            unionization in the countryside, the traditional control of the <hi
                                rend="italic">patrón</hi> over his workers is breaking down. Strikes
                            to press salary and other demands are now legal and occur on a
                            province-wide basis.</p>
                        <p>6. The politicization of the rural population as a result of unionization
                            and agrarian reform continues apace. Not surprisingly, these
                            developments have met with the strong resistance of the landed
                            interests. Moreover, contrary to its promises, the Frei administration
                            has expropriated efficiently run farms. It has been charged, not without
                            some justification, with favoritism in selecting the farms to be
                            expropriated. In recent months, sporadic incidents of rural violence,
                            which have caused blood to be shed and property to be destroyed, have
                            become involved in the bitterly partisan national political contest to
                            determine Frei’s successor.</p>
                        <p>7. The Frei administration’s record on both economic growth and price
                            stability does not compare favorably with that of its predecessor
                                (<persName corresp="#p_ARJ_1">Jorge Alessandri</persName>,
                            1958–1964). Although Chile’s rate of economic growth rose to 6 percent
                            in 1965–1966, compared to about 5 percent under Alessandri, it fell to
                            less than 3 percent during 1967–1969, only in <pb n="61" facs="0101"
                                xml:id="pg_61"/>part because of an extended drought which affected
                            agricultural output in 1969. During his first two years in office Frei
                            substantially reduced the pace of inflation. By 1967, however, the
                            combination of rapidly rising wages, greatly increased government
                            spending, excessive monetary expansion, and stagnating output caused the
                            rise in the cost-of-living to accelerate. The official consumer price
                            index shows an average annual increase of 25 percent over the past three
                            years but other and more accurate official statistics<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d11fn3">Since 1966 the official price index, which serves as
                                a basis for negotiating wages, has fallen considerably short of the
                                true rate of inflation. The private consumption indexes provide a
                                more accurate measure and are used as the basis for the discussion
                                of real wages in the following paragraph. [Footnote is in the
                                original.]</note> suggest that a 33 percent rate of inflation is
                            closer to the mark, although that figure may also be too low.</p>
                        <p>8. The Frei administration has given a high priority to income
                            redistribution in order to raise the living standards of the nation’s
                            less privileged classes. In 1965–1966 (Frei’s first two years in office)
                            real wages rose by an estimated 25 percent. Since then, however, as the
                            pace of inflation quickened and Frei attempted to moderate further wage
                            demands, there has been little further advance. We estimate that,
                            although nominal wages increased by 36 percent in 1967, real wages
                            probably did not rise by more than 3 percent. Similarly, during 1968 and
                            1969, real wages barely held their own. (See Figure 2: “Real Wages and
                            Rates of Inflation in Chile Using Different Deflators.”) Although under
                            Frei many lower paid wage earners have received increases in real wages,
                            as well as expanded social services, the more prosperous and better
                            organized union workers have gained proportionately more because of
                            their greater bargaining power.</p>
                        <p>9. As a result of government policies which promoted a redistribution of
                            income and a continuing shift of resources from the private to the
                            public sector, domestic private enterprise has lacked both the funds and
                            the incentives to invest.<note n="4" xml:id="d11fn4">Under the Frei
                                administration public sector spending has gone from about 35 percent
                                to 50 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). By 1969 public
                                investment expenditures (including financing of private investment)
                                equaled about 80 percent of gross domestic investment compared with
                                less than 50 percent in 1963. [Footnote is in the original.]</note>
                            Private investment from domestic sources dropped significantly in the
                            1965–1969 period, going from about 9 percent to around 4 and a half
                            percent of GDP. Moreover, total fixed investment, excluding foreign
                            copper investment, was in absolute terms no higher in 1969 than it had
                            been in 1964, and as a share of GDP had fallen to about 13 percent. (See
                            Appendix for Figure 3: “Use of Available Resources, 1964–1969.”) Net
                            investment by the US copper companies increased at an average annual
                            rate of $125 million over the 1967–1969 period while other direct
                            foreign investment was negative.</p>
                        <pb n="62" facs="0102" xml:id="pg_62"/>
                        <p>10. Frei’s reform programs have involved high political costs, probably
                            exceeding his original expectations. Unlike most of his immediate
                            predecessors, who were elected from the left and ruled with the right,
                            Frei conscientiously attempted to carry out his campaign promises.
                            Because Frei’s changes have chiefly benefitted the lower classes,
                            tensions between the classes have been increased and have been carried
                            over into national politics. Political partisanship was also intensified
                            by Frei’s decision not to follow the traditional pattern of coalition
                            government, under which opposition parties secured cabinet and other
                            government posts in return for supporting the administration’s
                            legislative proposals. Moreover, as was the case with Cleopatra, where
                            Frei has most satisfied, he has most aroused: the very success of his
                            programs has led to still further economic demands and created political
                            pressures for more radical changes. The detrimental economic effects of
                            rapid reform in turn have limited the administration’s ability to meet
                            the expectations it aroused, and this has hurt the Christian Democratic
                            Party (<gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>11. Although Frei has established himself as the most popular political
                            figure in Chile he has not transmitted his personal popularity to his
                            party’s candidate. Furthermore, his insistence on abiding by
                            constitutional procedures and accepting the consequent delay and
                            watering-down of his programs caused recurrent dissension within the
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>. More important, in 1964 the
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> provided the only attractive
                            alternative to the candidate supported by the Communists and even more
                            extremist elements of the society. By contrast, the independent voters,
                            and particularly the nominally conservative voters who supported Frei in
                            1964, now have a widely-respected candidate, <persName
                                corresp="#p_ARJ_1">Jorge Alessandri</persName>, as a non-Marxist

                        <p>12. These developments have contributed to the difficulties Frei’s party
                            faces in the election to choose his successor scheduled for 4 September.
                            There are, of course, other factors involved, which we propose to
                            examine in the following analysis of the electoral contest, the
                            character of the next administration and the implications for the

                            an acceleration of change but has remained within the movement <pb

                            American Communist party or any other Chilean party. It has been careful
                            to play down its close adherence to the Moscow line and to avoid direct
                            involvement in violent revolutionary action. This is in line with the

                            rent by personal rivalries as well as by differences over policies and

                            moderate faction, it has consistently been more radical than the

                            advocates the seizure of power by force as the only way the Marxists can
                            come to power in Chile. The <gloss target="#t_PS_1">PS</gloss>draws its
                            following largely from the lower classes, particularly organized labor,
                            but also has some support among student and professional elements of
                            society. In the last congressional election in 1969, the <gloss

                                facs="0104" xml:id="pg_64"/>portance, however, is the PR. Until
                            eclipsed by the rapid rise of the Christian Democratic movement, the
                                <gloss target="#t_PR_1">PR</gloss> had been the major centrist party
                            in Chilean politics, representing middle and some upper as well as lower
                            class interests. In recent years the <gloss target="#t_PR_1">PR</gloss>
                            has been beset by recurrent factionalism with respect to policies and
                            tactics, which has been exacerbated by personal rivalries. As a result
                            the <gloss target="#t_PR_1">PR</gloss> fell from first position in the
                            congressional elections of 1961 to fourth position in 1969, when it
                            secured just under 13 percent of the total vote. Over the last year or
                            so the party leadership courted the Communists and Socialists in the
                            hope of securing their support for a Radical candidate in the September
                            1970 elections. This tactic of wooing the Marxist left seriously
                            disrupted the party. When its leaders decided to go along with a
                            Socialist candidate—after their own was rejected—some prominent Radicals
                            and many among the rank and file bolted the <gloss target="#t_PR_1"
                                >PR</gloss> and now support Alessandri.</p>

                                >The Chilean security forces consist of an army of some 23,000, a
                                navy of about 14,000, an air force of over 9,500 and the Carabineros
                                of nearly 24,000. The Carabineros have initial responsibility for
                                maintaining internal order but in case of emergency they are placed
                                under army command. [Footnote is in the original.]</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>18. After the early 1930s, the Chilean Armed Forces established and
                            maintained a generally apolitical position which has only recently been
                            brought into question. The army, the predominant service, usually
                            managed to make its views known to the top-level of the administration
                            in power and when grievances arose they were settled quietly on that
                            level. Since the Carabineros (national police) were charged with the day
                            to day task of maintaining internal order, they suffered the resentment
                            engendered in putting down demonstrations and riots staged by student
                            and other political activists. Only when such matters threatened to get
                            out of hand did the army take over to restore order. Both continue to
                            enjoy a respected position in Chilean society.</p>
                        <p>19. In October 1969, some army units led by Brigadier General <persName
                                corresp="#p_VMR_1">Roberto Viaux</persName> mutinied over serious
                            grievances involving salaries eroded by inflation, deteriorating
                            equipment, and dissatisfaction with Frei’s appointees to the top
                            military posts. The military leadership had tried earlier to paper over
                            these problems by removing <persName corresp="#p_VMR_1">Viaux</persName>
                            from command of troops. The mutiny, known as the “Tacnazo,” was quickly
                            contained and the military were calmed down by salary increases and the
                            replacement of the Minister of Defense and some military leaders. But
                            resentment in the military and apprehension among the political leaders
                            persists. The upshot of all this is that the politicians can no longer
                            take for granted the tradition of the Chilean Armed Forces of not
                            involving themselves directly in Chilean politics. This is not to say
                            that <pb n="65" facs="0105" xml:id="pg_65"/>the armed forces are soon to
                            go the way of repeated intervention in national politics as has been the
                            case with some other Latin American security forces. It is clear,
                            however, that the Chilean Armed Forces, and perhaps the Carabineros as
                            well, have a renewed awareness of their potential political power and a
                            greater inclination to use it.</p>

                        <p>20. During this campaign the electorate is weighing a number of factors
                            not present or not as important in 1964. This time the voters have a
                            choice not only between the pace of reform (Frei and <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> in 1964) but also between
                            reform (<persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>) and consolidation
                            (Alessandri). With the “Tacnazo” still in their minds, many may consider
                            whether the election of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            would increase the possibility of military intervention. So far the
                            policy of the US and its presence are not nearly the important issue in
                            this campaign that they were in 1964.</p>

                            (1958–1964), appears to be the front runner among the three major
                            candidates. He draws support from all classes in Chilean society. A
                            successful businessman and a political conservative by Chilean
                            standards, Alessandri has capitalized on the distrust many independent
                            voters have for “politicians” by stressing his own political
                            independence. A crusty, 74 year-old bachelor, he nevertheless has
                            established a “father image” with particular appeal to the distaff side
                            of the electorate. Moreover, Alessandri has a reputation for personal
                            integrity, political honesty, and competence which rivals that of Frei
                            himself. Alessandri is supported by the conservative <gloss

                            by right-wing and centrist groups formerly aligned with the PR, and by
                            nominally independent voters, including many from the lower class.</p>
                        <p>22. During the present election campaign the deterioration in
                            Alessandri’s physical condition has become apparent to a public which
                            has seen relatively little of him since late 1964. Alessandri has been
                            unable to compete with his younger rivals in the vigor of his
                            campaigning. Their more efficiently managed and smoother functioning
                            political organizations also appear to have contributed to a gradual
                            erosion of his large early lead. His candidacy has also been affected by
                            statements and actions of some of his more reactionary supporters in the
                                <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss>, including statements and actions
                            defending the use of force in opposing agrarian reform.</p>
                        <p>23. Nonetheless, Alessandri’s basic appeal as a man of integrity, who is
                            above petty politics and can set things right, persists. While he
                            obviously attracts those who feel he can reverse or at least slow down
                                <pb n="66" facs="0106" xml:id="pg_66"/>the pace of change, he also
                            draws support from those who believe that Chile needs time to
                            consolidate and adjust to the changes wrought under Frei, rather than to
                            accelerate the pace as the two other candidates promise. Moreover, the
                            serious disturbances of late June, involving urban terrorism by the
                            extreme left and clashes between the Carabineros and students, is more
                            likely to redound to Alessandri’s benefit as a “law and order” candidate
                            than to the benefit of his two leftist opponents. These incidents also
                            bolster Alessandri’s emphasis on the <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>25. The electoral platform of the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> does
                            not differ markedly from that on which <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> has run in previous elections. It stresses the
                            unification of “popular” forces in order to carry out extensive and
                            radical reforms. High in its priorities are the rapid nationalization of
                            broad segments of the economy, including the remaining US ownership in
                            the big copper mines. Although <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> has played down his identification with

                            be something of a handicap in the election of 1964, he promises to

                            Communist China, and North Korea, and to increase trade and other ties
                            with these and other Communist nations.</p>

                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> spokesmen have not campaigned
                            extensively against the US as they did in 1964. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, in particular, has stressed
                            bread-and-butter issues and has skirted the more extreme proposals in
                            the Basic Program of the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> in his
                            attempt to present himself as a moderate, pragmatic leftist. In the last
                            few weeks this strategy has been undercut by the identification of
                            individuals captured in guerrilla training camps as members of the PS.
                            Furthermore, since <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is
                            identified with the Marxist left, he has been adversely affected by the
                            recent outbursts of terrorism and violence involving leftist

                            <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Radomiro Tomic</persName> is a veteran
                            Christian Democratic leader, sometime Senator, and former Chilean
                            Ambassador to the US. He accepted nomination by his party only after his
                            grand strategy for bringing the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>
                            into an electoral coalition with the Communists and Socialists was
                            rejected by the leaders of all three parties. Although he has a record
                            of solid achievement by the Frei administration to run on, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> has continued to press still
                            further leftward, insisting that he will follow a non-capitalist path,
                            speed up agrarian reform, and nationalize various industries, including
                            the holdings of the US copper companies during his first year in office.
                            He apparently believes that his best campaign strategy is to talk
                            sufficiently to the left to attract the large segment of the population
                            that wants change but hesitates to entrust it to a Marxist candidate.
                            Thus the principal difference between the domestic platforms of
                                <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is that <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> mingles some assurances to
                            private enterprise with his calls for achieving a vaguely defined
                            variety of socialism under a constitutional system; for example, he
                            promises to negotiate compensation for the nationalized mining
                            properties. In the field of foreign policy <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName> acknowledges the importance of close relations
                            with the US, but stresses the necessity of an independent role.</p>
                        <p>28. Initially, <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>’s campaign
                            was slowed by the fact that some of his rivals for the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> nomination and other more moderate
                            party members, including Frei, gave him something less than enthusiastic
                            support. He has recovered from that low point by conducting a most
                            energetic campaign and by putting more stress on the positive
                            achievements of the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> in power.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>, however, still
                            concentrates much of his campaign oratory against the right and
                            Alessandri. His reluctance to come out forcefully against the disorders
                            caused by leftist students, and the terrorist activities involving
                            student and other extreme leftists, has embarrassed the Frei government
                            and left the law and order issue to Alessandri by default. The hierarchy
                            of the Roman Catholic Church, in contrast to its support of Frei and the
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> in 1964, is maintaining a
                            non-partisan position.<note n="6" xml:id="d11fn6">Before the 1964
                                elections, the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church had openly
                                broken its formerly close ties with the country’s conservative
                                forces. Although leaders of the Church maintained that it was
                                neutral, their statements endorsing reform identified them with Frei
                                and the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>, which had adopted the
                                hierarchy’s Pastoral Letter of September 1962 as the basis for its
                                party platform. The hierarchy has put considerably more emphasis on
                                the non-partisan role of the Church toward this election than it did
                                in 1964, among other things because it does not regard <persName

                        <p>29. <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> has certain valuable
                            assets. He has the backing of the government apparatus and the country’s
                            largest political party, which is well-funded and well-organized for the
                            campaign. He undoubtedly will attract much of his support from the
                            middle and lower-middle classes and from many of the new lower class
                            voters who have benefited or hope to benefit from reforms associated
                            with the Frei administration. <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName> probably also will be supported by some
                            conservatives and moderates who cannot accept either the

                            the aged and autocratic Alessandri. Despite these assets, however, and
                            the recovery he has made from his initial slow start, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> still appears to be running
                            third in a three-man race.</p>

                        <p>30. At the present time, no candidate seems likely to win the majority
                            needed for direct election. In that event the Congress would meet on 24
                            October to choose between the candidates who finish first and second. On
                            four previous occasions when this has occurred (1920, 1946, 1952 and
                            1958), the Congress in effect ratified the popular vote by selecting the
                            front-runner, regardless of how slim a margin he obtained. This time,
                            however, there almost certainly will be more political horsetrading than
                            on previous occasions—particularly if the front-runner is Alessandri,
                            who has only 43 nominal supporters among the 200 members of
                                Congress.<note n="7" xml:id="d11fn7">The other 157 votes appear to
                                be split fairly evenly between supporters of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> (82) and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> (75). [Footnote is in the
                                original.]</note> Unless his share of the vote approaches the 40
                            percent mark, Alessandri might be passed over, particularly if <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> is second and within a few
                            percentage points in the popular vote. But if <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is second—even a close
                            second—Frei’s influence, and perhaps that of the military, would be
                            exerted on behalf of Alessandri, ostensibly to honor the Chilean
                            tradition of ratifying the popular vote but in reality to block
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. If Alessandri
                            finishes second, his chances of winning Congressional approval are
                            virtually nil if <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> leads the
                            pack, and poor even if <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            edges him by a narrow margin.</p>
                        <p>31. On the other hand, if <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>
                            were to secure even a slim plurality in the popular vote, he would
                            almost certainly be elected. If he came in a close second his chances
                            for victory would be good against either of the two other candidates.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, however, must
                            finish first in the popular vote in order to have much of a chance of
                            becoming president. Even then, if his margin over <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> is narrow, enough of the <gloss

                            elect <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>. If <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s margin over Alessandri is
                            narrow, the outcome would be largely decided <pb n="69" facs="0109"
                                xml:id="pg_69"/>within the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>.
                            Since <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> has continued to
                            court the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>, and Frei has opposed such
                            tactics, there might be a showdown between the two for control of the
                            party’s congressional bloc. Frei may use his influence to block
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> if <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> leads Alessandri. And he might

                            ran not too close a second on 4 September.</p>
                        <p>32. Although the percentages of the popular vote won by the two final
                            contestants will be extremely important in deciding the winner, other
                            factors will come into play if there is a close one-two finish. The
                            commander in chief of the army has publicly and categorically announced
                            military support for the constitutional right of the Congress to select
                            either candidate. The unanswered question is whether he speaks for and
                            can control the army, to say nothing of the navy, the air force and the
                            Carabineros. In the event that public unrest continues—let alone
                            accelerates—and Alessandri finishes only slightly ahead of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> or even <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>, there is at least some chance
                            that Alessandri’s backers would find allies among other military leaders
                            in putting pressure on the Congressmen who might otherwise be inclined
                            to vote against him.</p>
                        <p>33. In the event that the decision goes to the Congress and <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is rejected, his supporters
                            are likely to carry out widespread public demonstrations. These could
                            lead to violent street encounters with the security forces. If <persName

                        <p>3141. For <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName> from <persName

                        <p>1. Many thanks for <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss> which
                            confirms our total agreement on all points. Hope you will understand
                            why, despite my totally harmonious talks with <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJH_1">Crimmins</persName>, I wished to have in writing
                            your views so as to avoid my inadvertent risking of the very dangers we
                            both perceive. (I am shamed by this admission of bureaucratic
                            proclivity.)</p>
                        <p>2. In that connection, the Communist Party’s physical raid on the
                            advertising agency that spearheads the anti-Communist anti-<persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> propaganda campaign has
                            bitterly disappointed the <gloss target="#t_PCCh_1">PCCh</gloss> because
                            of its failure to implicate the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>.
                            Therefore it is possible if not probable that as they have often done,
                            (you will recall the anti-Peace Corps campaign here) the Communists will
                            fabricate documents. I intend to get word to Frei of this possibility,
                            of my lack of real concern and of my expectation that he will see to it
                            that this effort is discredited to the maximum extent by those resources
                            he controls.</p>
                        <p>3. Re Phase Two, I would like to stress that if Phase One continues to be
                            as effective as it is and that if other factors mesh, there will be no
                            rpt no need for any Phase Two since <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> will not be a threat. The election results will
                            determine our actions. Without knowing the results and without really
                            knowing what Frei may be planning, we operate in a vacuum of speculation
                            and theories in which I pump out thousands of words for contingencies
                            without really having any confidence that the contingency will develop
                            (prior or post inauguration) or that it will develop in any of the
                            manners I hypothesize. But because the game may well begin Sept 5th, I
                            hope you understand why I must continue to try to fashion possible
                            models that may or may not be compatible with either the circumstances
                            that prevail Sept 5th or with Washington today. Election Perspectives #5

                                the ultimate goal of establishing an authoritarian Marxist state.
                                Long-term goals of an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> administration would thus include the
                                suppression of free elections, the state ownership of all or almost
                                all business enterprises, the establishment of state farms, and the
                                imposition of police-backed labor discipline.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, an adept and
                                experienced politician who seems to share the caution of Chile’s
                                Moscow-leaning Communist Party, would almost certainly move
                                gradually and with great care toward these goals. Within the first
                                few years of his administration, however, we would expect to see him
                                attempt to defuse, dismantle, or destroy various groups and
                                institutions which currently stand between him and his
                                objectives.</p>
                            <p>In the political sphere, his administration will waste little time in
                                attacking the conservative National Party through its economic
                                bases, and in attempting to split the Christian Democratic Party by
                                wooing that portion of it which favors some of his programs. Should
                                    <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> succeed in
                                overcoming effective political opposition, he would then move toward
                                some of the institutional restructuring—establishment of the
                                promised unicameral “People’s Assembly,” subordination of the
                                judiciary to political control—required for the achievement of his
                                ultimate goals.</p>
                            <p>In the economic sector, we would expect <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> first to move toward carrying out his
                                platform’s promises to expropriate basic industries, with the copper
                                companies, petroleum distributors, and banks at the head of the
                                list. The imposition of strict controls, focusing on consumer prices
                                and foreign exchange, would also be part of his early program, as
                                would a variety of tax measures and credit restrictions aimed at
                                crippling or destroying the major private enterprises. Reasonable
                                success in these attempts would probably be followed, still in a
                                cautious manner, by a widening in the scope of measures to bring the
                                economy under the complete control of the state. As governmental
                                control of commerce and industry widened, labor freedoms would be
                                    <pb n="79" facs="0119" xml:id="pg_79"/>increasingly restricted,
                                with the long-range goal being their entire elimination.</p>
                            <p>An <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> administration
                                would place heavy emphasis on a sharp and rapid expansion in
                                government-provided social services, hoping thereby to win public
                                support and disarm the opposition. Measures would include
                                intensified housing and public-works programs, and expanded
                                educational and public-health efforts. Agrarian reform would
                                probably receive considerable emphasis with the dual purpose of
                                gratifying the rural masses and destroying the political and
                                economic power of the major landowners.</p>
                            <p>It is with regard to the security forces that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would exercise the
                                greatest caution of all. Initially he would attempt to set aside
                                suspicions, with the short-term goal of neutralizing the Armed
                                Forces and the Carabineros. To this end, he would almost certainly
                                move to improve military pay, benefits, and equipment. The
                                prerogatives and traditional practices of the President as Commander
                                in Chief would enable him not only to name a Defense Minister and
                                service chiefs politically sympathetic to him, but to begin by
                                careful use of promotions and assignments to remove military leaders
                                thought to oppose Popular Unity. Over time, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would be attempting to
                                achieve the support of the Armed Forces for his programs. Some
                                restructuring of their organization could occur in the process, and
                                an attempt to establish a counter-balancing “People’s Militia,” or
                                alternatively to convert the Armed Forces into something similar,
                                could eventually be made. The length of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName>’s quest for the presidency and the
                                Communists’ almost pathological fear of a military crackdown,
                                however, both would almost certainly lead an <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> administration to move, at
                                least initially, with prudence in its dealings with the Armed
                                Forces, and an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                                administration would quickly back off in this period should military
                                sensitivities begin to appear aroused. Indications of an <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> administration’s immediate
                                intentions with regard to the Carabineros are limited to a pledge to
                                disband the Mobile Groups, crack civil-disturbance units long
                                targeted by the Chilean left as a primary arm of repression.</p>

                                beyond the fact that it has been made during the electoral campaign,
                                could well mean something entirely different to <persName

                                Certainly the measures which he has promised to take would raise to
                                a very high level the likelihood, and even the inevitability, of
                                some kind of confrontation. He could well seek controversy with the
                                United States in order to gain support at home. At the same time, we
                                believe he would avoid provoking the United States to take serious
                                action, and would not want to put us in the position of the
                                aggrieved party.</p>

                                Bolivia in particular could become a troublesome temptation:
                                Individual Chileans have already been found within Bolivia’s main

                            <p>With particular regard to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>,
                                an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> administration
                                would almost certainly seek economic assistance, and possibly even

                            <p>As for <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s seeking
                                fairly early in his administration a major Soviet presence—military
                                or political-economic—a number of factors make such a policy
                                doubtful. These include Chilean nationalism, concern about possible
                                reaction by the United States and neighboring countries—particularly
                                Argentina—and historic apprehension by some Chilean Socialists
                                regarding the Soviets. Nevertheless, the assumption that Chile would
                                not offer the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> bases or permit
                                Soviet equipment or a presence remains uncertain.</p>
                            <p>With regard to Cuba, the Popular Unity pledge to “solidify itself
                                with the Cuban revolution” is unlikely to result in a Chilean

                            <p>In the pursuit of his goals, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> would have some important assets. He is a
                                familiar figure in Chile, with a comfortingly bourgeois lifestyle.
                                He is considered idealistic, and his honesty has never been publicly
                                questioned. He is also an experienced and adept politician who first
                                entered Congress in 1937, has served in both houses, was in the
                                cabinet for a time during the first Popular Front government, and
                                first ran for the presidency in 1952. While his relations with the
                                hierarchy of the Socialist Party are poor, he has the backing of the
                                larger, better-organized and better-disciplined Communist Party. The
                                influence of both parties in the media, the labor sector, and the
                                educational institutions is currently strong, and with the leverage
                                and resources of government could become predominant. The sympathy
                                of at least a portion of the Christian Democratic Party for some of
                                his goals—including the expropriation of important industries—would
                                provide him initially with a congressional majority for parts of his
                                program. As a constitutionally elected president he would enjoy not
                                only the prestige of the office and of his legal accession to it,
                                but also a broad range of constitutional powers and prerogatives.
                                Furthermore, Chile has already moved a considerable distance down
                                the path <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would want
                                to pursue: the Chilean economy is already heavily statist with
                                respect to basic industry, for example, and Chile’s “independent”
                                thrust in foreign policy has already led it to closer contact with
                                socialist countries and exports to Cuba. Timely and effective
                                resistance to his program by the various groups opposed would be
                                handicapped by the many divisions and uncertainties which would
                                exist among them.</p>
                            <p>In the process of attempting to achieve his goals, however, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would have to contend with
                                a variety of groups and factors. The Armed Forces and the
                                Carabineros, for example, have been widely <pb n="82" facs="0122"
                                    xml:id="pg_82"/>viewed as representing a brake on <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s plans. We do not believe
                                that any of the security forces would act to prevent <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> from constitutionally
                                taking office: general acceptance of the Marxists as <hi
                                    rend="italic">bona fide</hi> Chilean politicians, disparate
                                political views within the security forces, and their traditional
                                (if recently weakened) respect for constitutional processes lead us
                                to this view. The Armed Forces, particularly at the higher levels,
                                would nevertheless regard the new president with considerable
                                suspicion and even hostility; and this would be even truer in the
                                case of the Carabineros, who have borne the brunt of
                                Marxist-inspired civil disorders. As we have stated in section I.A.
                                above, we would expect <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> to combine generosity with a careful policy
                                of assignments and promotions in order to allay these suspicions and
                                remove the obviously hostile from key positions. Should he move with
                                sufficient caution and skill, we believe these acts would further
                                decrease the prospects for a cohesive, institutional military move
                                against him.</p>
                            <p>Nevertheless, such a move, or alternatively a coup by key units
                                banking on the support or acquiescence of the rest of the security
                                forces, would remain a real possibility, and could be triggered
                                should <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> act in
                                outright violation of the constitution or move in a way clearly
                                threatening to the military’s institutional interests. The outbreak
                                of widespread civilian opposition to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName>’s program could also be a factor in
                                determining military resolve to remove him. In sum, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would appear unable to
                                move precipitously against the military or the constitution, but a
                                gradualist approach sufficiently prudent to avoid inciting the
                                military or the civilian political opposition could result in a
                                steady erosion of the military’s capacity and will to move against
                                him.</p>
                            <p>The non-Marxist majority in Congress (which will legally remain
                                intact until March 1973) would also represent a potential stumbling
                                block to the realization of an authoritarian Marxist state. In
                                particular, Popular Unity’s call for a unicameral “People’s
                                Assembly” is most unlikely to find favor with opposition congressmen
                                looking forward to the continued exercise of office. As a minority
                                president, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would be
                                taking a great risk in attempting to use the new plebiscite power to
                                settle a constitutional impasse with Congress. A broad range of
                                other powers would be constitutionally available to him as
                                president, but any attempt by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> to use them to do away with Congress or
                                govern in defiance of it would be likely to arouse the kind of
                                opposition that would stimulate the military to remove him. By
                                itself, however, Congress might find itself out-maneuvered were
                                    <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to become
                                president and move skillfully and cautiously enough.</p>
                            <p>Somewhat similarly, Chile’s weak and archaic legal system by itself
                                would seem unlikely to provide effective resistance.</p>

                            <p>In Congress or out, the political parties (except the Communists,

                                offer some potential for resistance, but would have their
                                difficulties in bringing it effectively to bear. Within Popular

                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> could have problems
                                with the economy. Chile’s dependence on copper—80% of export
                                earnings in 1969—would probably not constitute a problem, as the
                                world market is expected to remain reasonably firm over the next few
                                years. The principal markets for Chilean copper, Western Europe and
                                Japan, would be unlikely to close as a result of U.S. or
                                copper-company pressure. Furthermore, high copper prices and record
                                Chilean production have given Chile an unprecedentedly high balance
                                of foreign reserves, a comfortable cushion for <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. On the other hand, action
                                against foreign investment would tend to dry up foreign sources of
                                investment and credit, on which Chile has been heavily dependent.
                                Soviet assistance, were it forthcoming, could off-set this problem,
                                if only partially. The country’s decades-old inflation (currently
                                running in excess of 30%) is Chile’s most keenly felt issue.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> can diminish the

                                of non-intervention. Depending on the degree of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s finesse, some might be
                                attracted to follow in his efforts to weaken the <gloss
                                    target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> and work through exclusively Latin
                                American organizations. The internal stability of some countries
                                would also be affected if, for example, Marxist elements encouraged
                                by the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> example (see
                                below) were to step up the scope and pace of their efforts, as they
                                probably would.</p>
                            <p>Were <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to become
                                Chile’s next president, his victory would undoubtedly provide
                                Marxists everywhere with an enormous boost in morale and in
                                propaganda effectiveness, particularly because he would have been
                                chosen constitutionally. An <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> victory would inevitably be seen around the
                                world and within the United States as a definite set-back to U.S.
                                interests and aspirations and would be exploited as such by our
                                adversaries. As an example of a Marxist-Leninist state, Chile under
                                    <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would doubtless
                                inspire Marxist elements throughout the hemisphere, and the result
                                could be an increase in pressure on the region’s more moderate
                                governments. Private foreign investment, already under attack now,
                                would be a particular target for such pressure. We note,
                                nevertheless, that Chile as an example would be unlikely to find any
                                effective hemispheric imitator, at least for some time: the
                                strength, skill, and freedom of action of Chile’s Marxist sector are
                                unique at present in the region.</p>
                            <p>The influence that Chile as a Marxist-Leninist state could wield is
                                subject to further limitations. As we have stated, the addition of
                                another Marxist voice to the hemispheric dialogue seems certain to
                                increase tensions. As a regional leader, however, Chile has enjoyed
                                    influ<pb n="87" facs="0127" xml:id="pg_87"/>ence out of
                                proportion to her size and strength because of her credentials as a
                                genuine democracy committed to an independent foreign policy. To the
                                extent that Chile under <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> might become identified as just another
                                mouthpiece for Moscow, her ability to persuade others would be
                                correspondingly diminished. Similarly, the economic difficulties
                                that we foresee <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                                encountering in fairly short order would limit the “model effect” of
                                Chile.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>In sum, we would expect an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> government to move gradually and cautiously
                                toward the establishment of an authoritarian Marxist state. To this
                                end, it would seek to destroy, neutralize, or obtain the support of
                                the various groups and institutions which might block its progress.
                                Some groups, most notably the security forces, would be watching
                                    <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> closely, and
                                could move to overthrow him if he were seen flagrantly flouting the
                                constitution or threatening the military’s institutional interests.
                                Divisions and uncertainties within and among these groups, however,
                                mean that a sufficiently gradualist and skillful approach by
                                    <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> could avoid
                                provoking the military almost indefinitely. On this basis, time
                                would enable <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to
                                entrench himself ever more firmly in power.</p>
                            <p>Internationally, we see as one of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName>’s goals the extirpation of U.S. influence
                                from Chile. While we expect him to try to avoid a serious
                                provocation of the U.S., his promised actions, including the
                                expropriation of the U.S. copper companies, raise to a high level
                                the probability of some kind of confrontation with us. We take at
                                face value <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                                platform promises to “denounce” the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1"
                                    >OAS</gloss>, to intensify relations with socialist countries
                                and to establish close ties with Cuba. Expansion of the Soviet
                                presence in Chile could occur in many different ways, but we believe
                                the establishment of a major permanent Soviet military presence to
                                be unlikely but not impossible. We also believe <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would probably—and almost
                                certainly in the period in which he was trying to consolidate
                                himself—avoid the risks of discernible Chilean subversion in other
                                countries.</p>
                            <p>Regarding threats to U.S. interests, we conclude that:</p>
                            <p>1. The U.S. has no vital national interests within Chile. There
                                would, however, be tangible economic losses.</p>
                            <p>2. The world military balance of power would not be significantly
                                altered by an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                                government.</p>
                            <p>3. An <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> victory would,
                                however, create considerable political and psychological costs:</p>
                            <p>a. Hemispheric cohesion would be threatened by the challenge that an
                                    <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government would
                                pose to the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>, and by the reac<pb
                                    n="88" facs="0128" xml:id="pg_88"/>tions that it would create in
                                other countries. We do not see, however, any likely threat to the
                                peace of the region.</p>
                            <p>b. An <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> victory would
                                represent a definite psychological set-back to the U.S. and a
                                definite psychological advance for the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                    >USSR</gloss> and the Marxist idea.</p>
                            <p>The issue that the foregoing analysis poses is this: what can and
                                should the U.S. Government do to limit or to prevent the clearly
                                negative effects of an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> government on our interests in Chile, the

                                consistent with our legislative restraints, and our willingness to
                                consider on their merits reasonable Chilean requests for assistance,

                                differences in outlook, we would do our utmost to sidestep potential
                                confrontations, e.g. over expropriation of the U.S. copper
                                companies.</p>

                                different ideological viewpoints. By taking the most positive
                                possible approach, we would be encouraging Chile to remain in the
                                hemispheric structure and undercut those seeking to move Chile
                                closer to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. We would also
                                avoid casting the U.S. in the role of a great power taking harsh
                                measures against a weak, poor, and distant neighbor. This stance
                                would show, in Chile and out, that we are prepared to give <persName

                                of Latin candidates for office. It would thus minimize <persName

                                support by claiming “imperialist” pressure.</p>
                            <p>This option could blunt charges that we pushed <persName

                                could increase the chances of maintaining a U.S. presence in Chile.
                                Finally, it does not rule out the possibility of subsequently

                                contingencies. Such a stance would be cool and correct and would
                                recognize <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                                constitutional status. We would receive calmly any Chilean request
                                for the removal of personnel or the termination of programs, and
                                carry out the request expeditiously and as gracefully as possible.
                                In the absence of such requests we would let existing programs wind
                                down. Personnel connected with any program would depart when the
                                program ended, and there would be no new starts in bilateral
                                assistance. In our reaction to anti-U.S. measures, for example the
                                expropriation of the U.S. copper companies, the presumption would be
                                in favor of avoiding in the early stages a rigid response but not to
                                foreclose the adoption of such a response should developments
                                warrant it. Our position in the multilateral agencies regarding
                                Chilean requests for aid would be keyed to the foregoing factors. We
                                would try to concert with other countries of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> regarding Chile, but would not
                                forego our right to independent decisions. In every instance, the
                                keynote would be flexibility.</p>
                            <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Advantages</hi>—This option would convey the
                                appearance of greater firmness (than in Option A) in the face of
                                what would widely be viewed as a set-back, and at the same time
                                would avoid, as would Option A, the political risks of intervention.
                                Moreover, this option would afford flexibility, as it could be
                                softened to Option A or hardened to Option C as circumstances
                                warranted. Consequently this option is much more directly
                                controllable by us than Option A. Additionally, it would avoid the
                                appearance of support for <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"

                                to the collective approach whenever possible.</p>

                                contrast markedly with the high level of aid given Chile during the
                                early years of the Frei administration. It could strengthen the hand
                                of the hardliners in the Chilean government, and might facilitate
                                the movement of Chile into the Soviet orbit.</p>

                                This premise would subsume the desirability or acceptability to us
                                of a frankly, explicitly hostile U.S. posture. We would on our own

                                pull out aid and military missions, and sharply reduce the U.S.
                                Embassy presence in Chile, perhaps to the point of breaking
                                relations. We would freeze Chilean assets in the U.S. Our economic
                                measures would follow the Cuban program, e.g. an embargo of all
                                trade between Chile and the U.S. and the severing of transportation
                                links. We would seek—or preferably support—an <gloss

                                resources, and we would seek the cooperation of others to this end.
                                We would also seek to deprive Chile of markets, especially for
                                copper.</p>

                            nationals.</p>
                        <p>It is assumed that the only institution in Chile capable of removing

                            from assuming office if he is elected is the Chilean military. However,
                            it is not likely that the Chilean military will act against <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> actions that <pb

                            traditions. A direct threat to the military itself would be the most
                            pronounced provocation, but acts seen as flagrantly flouting the
                            structure of Chilean political, social and economic traditions
                            conceivably could stimulate a move by the Chilean armed forces. But it
                            must be recognized that the military in Chile traditionally respect the
                            constitution and generally pursue a role of non-involvement in political
                            affairs. We have no information indicating that the military leaders
                            plan to abandon this posture in the event of an <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> victory. As stated in the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss>, we expect that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would move with extreme
                            caution with regard to the military forces. He would improve their pay
                            and perquisites, and by careful use of his powers of appointment and
                            promotion, would put into key spots officers sympathetic to him while
                            isolating opponents. In these circumstances the emergence of a unified
                            bloc of officers dedicated to the prevention of a revolutionary Marxist
                            state in Chile is not a realistic prospect. In summary, we cannot depend
                            on the military for spontaneous and independent action to remove
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, at least during the
                            early stages of his administration.</p>
                        <p>It can be assumed that national party leaders and conservative business
                            elements fearing an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            government would give some thought to involving the military in
                            contingency planning. However, we do not know the breadth and depth of
                            the contacts maintained with the military or which may be under
                            development by these groups. But even though we thus are unable to make
                            a judgment as to the chances of success of such efforts to stimulate the
                            military, it is still considered doubtful that the latter would move
                            without itself being predisposed by its own conclusions as to the
                            undesirability of an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            government.</p>
                        <p>This option also assumes that the Argentine armed forces, although
                            unhappy with the prospects of an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> government, do not now have specific ideas about
                            an overthrow. Nor do we have any expectation that the Chilean military
                            would respond to an Argentine stimulus. It is possible, although
                            remotely, that the Argentine armed forces would complement a Chilean
                            military effort to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> if the latter undertook the step on its own
                            volition.</p>
                        <p>This option further assumes that U.S. support would be a helpful but
                            marginal factor in the calculations of the Chilean military in an
                            attempt to topple an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            administration. [<hi rend="italic">7 lines not declassified</hi>] If
                            these determinations augured well, steps could be taken toward the
                            objective of ultimately suggesting or sponsoring military action against
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. Even in this
                            estimate we conclude that the Chilean military must be already
                            conditioned and disposed to move on <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> and that our involvement would not be the
                            decisive influence to push them in this direction.</p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="0133" xml:id="pg_93"/>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Advantages</hi>—Successful U.S. involvement with a
                            Chilean military coup would almost certainly permanently relieve us of
                            the possibility of an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            government in Chile. The coup would demonstrate the unwillingness of
                            moderate Chilean forces to permit their country to be taken down the
                            path toward an authoritarian Marxist state and would show a degree of
                            concern by Chilean forces for the wellbeing of its neighbors in the
                            hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Disadvantages</hi>—This option plainly involves the
                            highest risks for the United States. The most important disadvantage is
                            that there is little chance that, even with our stimulation, an
                            overthrow of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would be
                            attempted, and there is almost no way to evaluate the likelihood that
                            such an attempt would be successful even were it made. An unsuccessful
                            attempt, involving as it probably would revelation of U.S.
                            participation, would have grave consequences for our relations in Chile,
                            in the hemisphere, in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Were
                            the overthrow effort to be successful, and even were U.S. participation
                            to remain covert—which we cannot assure—the United States would become a
                            hostage to the elements we backed in the overthrow and would probably be
                            cut off for years from most other political forces in the country,
                            including the Alessandri and Christian Democrat groups.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> from Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>. Subj: Kunakov
                            Archives.</p>
                        <p>1. Undersec Foreign Affairs <persName corresp="#p_SP_1">Patricio
                                Silva</persName> evening Aug 27 requested urgent meeting on
                            sensitive topics. Because he suggested it <pb n="94" facs="0134"
                                xml:id="pg_94"/>would be inconvenient for me to go to Ministry and
                            because of other commitments, he chose to come to residence for
                            breakfast Aug 28th.</p>
                        <p>2. Most important of three topics raised concerning suspicions of <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> intervention in Chilean affairs was
                            Kunakov archives appearing in <hi rend="italic">Mercurio</hi> and on
                            which I have had exchange of messages with addressees.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SP_1">Silva</persName> emphasized strongest
                            manner that only reason <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> approaching
                            me is that from outset of my stay here and on one or two occasions since
                            I declared to <persName corresp="#p_VPP_1">Valdes</persName> that there
                            is no <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> activity in this country
                            without my approval and that therefore anything considered <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> was my business and my responsibility.
                            Equally firmly he stressed that he was only raising suspicions and these
                            were not rpt not to be construed as accusations. Finally he stated that
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>’s motivation was to prevent
                            harm to US-Chilean relations.</p>
                        <p>4. Re Kunakov papers, <persName corresp="#p_SP_1">Silva</persName> began
                            by referring to 1967 beach-house affair concerning Soviet diplomat and
                            female member of Chilean Foreign Ministry, the sensitive topic to which
                            I anticipated <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> reaction in my
                            message to Asst. Sec. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>
                            earlier this week. He said <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> had
                            indications that in final two articles of series (#6 and #7) this
                            weekend, his Ministry would again be implicated via this beach house
                            affair. He wanted me to know that if the Ministry were mentioned in some
                            way other than another stale repetition of the minimal facts, it would
                            be forced to clear the record. It would do so by stating that this
                            entire affair was only between the two great powers and that no one in
                            the Ministry had ever been involved. He reminded me that Amb <persName
                                corresp="#p_DRA_1">Dungan</persName> had given Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_VPP_1">Valdes</persName> “the true facts” on the
                            incident. He said that only five or six Chileans knew these facts since
                            their record was kept under lock in the Minister’s own safe and that
                            only yesterday had he requested and received permission to read them. He
                            said the Chileans who knew “the true story” were the President,
                                <persName corresp="#p_VPP_1">Valdes</persName>, himself, his
                            predecessor Oscar Pinochet (now Amb to Moscow), Chilean Amb to Geneva
                            Besa (then the superior of the female employee), the ex-Sub-Director of
                            Investigaciones Zuniga and probably the late Investigaciones Director
                            Oelckers (whom he said never divulged anything to anyone). He added that
                            aside from one article in Socialist <hi rend="italic">Ultima Hora,</hi>
                            there had never been anything in press.</p>
                        <p>5. In response I reiterated that I took full responsibility for all
                            activities of U.S. personnel and that I understood why he had raised
                            with me his suspicions on Kunakov and other related matters. I
                            appreciated <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>’s consultation.</p>
                        <p>6. I said that I could give him categoric assurances that we were not
                            involved in any way with Kunakov. I added that I had just read #5 in the
                            series and that it appeared to be a further rehash of the four previous
                            articles without a single new fact. Hence I had assumed the series <pb
                                n="95" facs="0135" xml:id="pg_95"/>was terminated. If it were not,
                            then the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> could deal with the matter
                            in any way it saw fit taking into account, as it would, the further
                            damaging effect to our relations caused by statements of <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> spokesmen or <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> personalities.</p>
                        <p>7. As for Amb <persName corresp="#p_DRA_1">Dungan</persName> I really
                            knew nothing of what may have transpired between him and the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> on this beach-house matter. I had not
                            sought any information on the subject and had read with passing interest
                            the exchanges between right (<hi rend="italic">PEC</hi>) and left
                            journals here in 1968 or so on the subject and to which the author of
                            the Kunakov archives had alluded in the same fashion. I had taken no
                            special interest because I felt that my statements at the outset of my
                            stay to the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> re my responsibility
                            for all U.S. activities had clearly established ground rules and that
                            what was past was past. Frankly I had reacted to the Kunakov series in
                            the same manner as <persName corresp="#p_SP_1">Silva</persName> had in
                            his public comments and had so informed the Dept. I did not know when
                            the author had come to Chile nor anything else about him except that he
                            seemed to make a living out of commentaries that were anti-Communist.
                            Others made their living in Chile and elsewhere out of anti-U.S.
                            publicity. It was not my affair.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_SP_1">Silva</persName> said I was wrong about
                            the author. He had not emigrated to Chile; he was born of Yugoslav
                            immigrants in Punta Arenas; he was married to a white Russian who was a
                            fanatical anti-Soviet anti-Communist. She was a member of white Russian
                            groups that had been identified in U.S. publications as being part of
                            the worldwide <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> network. Because of
                            these antecedents and because it “appeared” to be so typical of other
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> operations elsewhere in the
                            world as described in authoritative books and publications in the U.S.,
                            he hoped I would understand why there were the suspicions that the
                            articles had engendered.</p>
                        <p>9. I said it had come as no surprise that such suspicions had been
                            articulated. Indeed I had become acclimated to such reactions. As I had
                            told the Undersec of Interior Achurra recently at a social function I
                            had expected that the <gloss target="#t_PCCh_1">PCCh</gloss>’s
                            disappointment over the meager results of its raid on the Andalien
                            offices, in particular no connection with the U.S., would lead to the
                            same kind of forgery of documents as in the Peace Corps affair last
                            year. I had compiled a lengthy list of incidents during my three year
                            stay in which the <gloss target="#t_PCCh_1">PCCh</gloss> had mounted
                            successful campaigns to destroy the U.S. prestige with the Chilean
                            public and with the sole exception of the attempt by a mob to sack our
                            Consulate after the overthrow of Belaunde Terry in Peru, the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> had implicitly endorsed each of these undertakings by
                            anti-American forces. These endorsements had come in the form of
                            deliberate silence as in the case of the Peace Corps when the govt had
                            the facts or in the form of background leaks that had complicated our
                            position as in the case of <pb n="96" facs="0136" xml:id="pg_96"
                            />Senator <persName corresp="#p_FMR_1">Fuentealba</persName>’s charges
                            and other instances which I could but would not mention since they were
                            not relevent to his question. However I did wish to stress that events
                            not words affected relations and that my interpretation of our relations
                            was that the U.S. would adhere strictly to bilateral relations and that
                            they would be carried out with rectitude no matter who was the future
                            President of Chile. We would have no special friendships with any
                            parties or factions, because we had been educated to understand that
                            favored prodigy relationships were neither welcome here nor productive
                            of mature partnerships.</p>
                        <p>10. U.S. policy was the framework for my assertions that I knew nothing
                            of the authors of their motivations and I really did not have any
                            interest in them. I could only suggest as an experienced hand that the
                            international organizations to which they allegedly had belonged or
                            belong had been subject to a great many changes in recent years as he
                            also must know from the press. The essential point I would hope he and
                            his colleagues would keep in mind is their knowledge that the U.S. was a
                            pluralistic society in which private organizations had the right to
                            defend their interests and had the access to a great deal of public
                            knowledge. Nothing in the Kunakov documents that I had read in <hi
                                rend="italic">Mercurio</hi> indicated anything but quasi-public
                            knowledge in Chile. I could only repeat my statement that we were not
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_SP_1">Silva</persName> began to defend his role
                            in Peace Corps but soon tired of that. He said he understood my position
                            and that he recognized that <hi rend="italic">Mercurio</hi> and Edwards
                            were committed to the triumph of Alessandri. They had deliberately sent
                            out a smoke screen to react to the congressional investigation of the
                            Commission of Terror. It was rather successful. It was not the same as
                                <hi rend="italic">PEC</hi>’s operations.</p>
                        <p>12. I interrupted to ask if he were suggesting that we had anything to do
                            with <hi rend="italic">PEC</hi>. He immediately and forcefully stated
                            that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> knew that we had nothing
                            to do with <hi rend="italic">PEC</hi>’s reincarnation nor any
                            relationship with it since then. I said that I wished him to know that
                            all members of my Mission had strictest instructions to have no form of
                            communication with anyone remotely connected with that publication. He
                            said he was aware of that instruction and believed it had been
                            implemented. He said the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> knew <hi
                                rend="italic">PEC</hi> had been re-launched by Carlos Urenda and
                            that therefore there was a clear link to Edwards. Comment: We have no
                            knowledge of any Urenda or Edwards connection with <hi rend="italic"
                                >PEC</hi>. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines not declassified</hi>] End
                            comment.</p>
                        <p>13. Another related subject raised by <persName corresp="#p_SP_1"
                                >Silva</persName> concerned a cable received this week from the
                            Chilean Embassy in Bogota which he showed me and which said:</p>
                        <p>A. Visas had been requested and granted for two U.S. officials named Ned
                            Zander Paes and Daniel Brice Baite. Former’s other visas to <pb n="97"
                                facs="0137" xml:id="pg_97"/>many Southeast Asia and Latin countries
                            were detailed and latter’s primarily to Latin American posts.</p>
                        <p>B. Extra-officially, the Chilean Embassy had also been requested (without
                            any source given as to whom or how) to provide multiple visas for four
                            unknown U.S. officials.</p>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_SP_1">Silva</persName> linked this to the third
                            topic which was that Chilean Emb Washington had just reported that since
                            June 30th and most recently this week groups of U.S. Navy officers and
                            enlisted men totalling 68 as of yesterday had requested three month
                            visas to Chile and that <persName corresp="#p_SP_1">Silva</persName> had
                            checked with Naval <gloss target="#t_CINC_1">CINC</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PAF_1">Porta</persName> to learn if any official
                            naval visits were anticipated. Reply was negative.</p>
                        <p>15. To both these questions I replied:</p>
                        <p>A. I knew nothing of either but our procedure was that I or <gloss
                                target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> personally approved every official
                            visitor. I had for more than one year blocked the visits of all U.S.
                            general officers much to their chagrin and to that of the Chilean high
                            command. I was certain that <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> would
                            have some fully acceptable explanation about the U.S. Navy visas and my
                            best guess would be that it had to do with <gloss target="#t_UNITAS_1"
                                >UNITAS</gloss>. However I would check by telephone with Washington
                            and with <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> immediately and I would
                            appreciate it if his Emb would be instructed to provide the names and
                            other details of the visas to the Dept officer who made the inquiry.
                            Comment: This query has been telephoned to Chile Desk and I have in the
                            interim informed <persName corresp="#p_SP_1">Silva</persName> by phone
                            that <gloss target="#t_UNITAS_1">UNITAS</gloss> band was making 24 hour
                            transit stop here Oct 15th while en route Buenos Aires to Lima. He
                            commented that they needed no three month visas for overnight stop and
                            requested complete investigation. I may wish to overrule plans for
                            band’s transit whatever the innocence of their travel. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SP_1">Silva</persName>’s suspicions only confirm
                            correctness of my policy on military and other visits.</p>
                        <p>B. As for Bogota I could only reiterate that no one would or had entered
                            the country without my or the <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss>’s
                            approval. No one would. I would make inquiries and let him know within
                            48 hours the results. However I did wish him to know that the Embassy
                            for reasons he would find justified (he agreed) was taking measures to
                            add to the personal protection of the official community; I had not
                            taken such actions earlier because in my judgment they were not
                            warranted but that there was no doubt we were approaching a much more
                            serious period insofar as personnel security was concerned. Comment: We
                            have checked with Emb Bogota and learned that Messers Paes and Baite are
                            State Dept communications personnel en route here in connection with
                            security. I will so inform <persName corresp="#p_SP_1">Silva</persName>
                            promptly. End comment.</p>
                        <p>16. I will weigh effects on Phase Two of all this after sleeping on it
                            during the weekend. I believe judgments expressed in my message to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName> prevail.</p>

                        <p>1. This memorandum provides the Committee with a series of options which,
                            if implemented, could influence the outcome of the election of a
                            president by the Chilean Congress on 24 October, if no candidate obtains
                            a majority in the general election on 4 September.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Background</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. On 25 March 1970 the 40 Committee endorsed a proposal for political
                            action designed to reduce the threat of a presidential victory by
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Salvador Allende</persName>, candidate
                            of the Popular Unity (<gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>—a coalition of
                            Communists, Socialists and leftists). On 27 June the Committee approved
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>’s request for
                            an additional [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>]
                            for anti-<persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> activities, but
                            deferred any decision on the Ambassador’s proposal for influencing the
                            congressional vote should the election go to Congress. The Committee was
                            briefed orally on 7 August at which time the risks involved in embarking
                            on a course of action to identify “persuadable” individuals in the
                            Chilean Congress were discussed. It was agreed that the Committee would
                            have to consider separately any request for authority to influence the
                            congressional vote.</p>
                        <p>b. The most recent reliable political surveys continue to indicate that
                            none of the three candidates will receive the required majority of
                            popular votes. <persName corresp="#p_ARJ_1">Jorge Alessandri</persName>,
                            the 74 year-old independent, continues to lead his rivals, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Radomiro Tomic</persName>, the Christian Democrat
                            Party (<gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>) candidate, but not with
                            sufficient strength to attract the majority support he needs to be
                            elected president on 4 September. This being the case, the constitution
                            requires that Congress select the president from the two candidates who
                            receive the highest <pb n="99" facs="0139" xml:id="pg_99"/>number of
                            popular votes. An analysis of the candidates’ voting strength in the
                            present 200-man Congress shows that the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> hold
                            82 votes, the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> have 75 and the Alessandri
                            supporters hold the remaining 43 seats. To elect a president on the
                            first ballot there must be a majority present (101) and the winning
                            candidate must poll a majority of those present. If no majority is
                            obtained a second vote is called. Should the second vote still not
                            produce a president, a third vote will take place on the following day
                            and the president will be elected by a simple majority of those present
                            and voting. The popular vote is expected to be close and in all
                            probability all 200 congressmen will be present for the first
                            ballot.</p>
                        <p>c. The Chilean tradition of endorsing the leading candidate on the basis
                            of popular votes cannot be counted upon in this election in which
                            political dynamics may disrupt party loyalties, especially within the
                            Christian Democratic and the Radical parties. For example, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s support in Congress of 82
                            votes is composed of 28 from the Communist Party, 19 from the Socialist
                            Party, 28 from the Radical Party, and the remaining 7 from the three
                            smaller parties in the coalition. With <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> in second place, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_FME_1">Eduardo Frei</persName> has said that he believes
                            about 18 Christian Democrats would support <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>. On the other hand, since Alessandri has
                            considerable influence among the Radicals, we can expect a number of
                            them to vote for Alessandri rather than <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>. How many might do so cannot be safely predicted
                            at this time, but probably there would be no fewer than six. Thus, as
                            second runner, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> could
                            have a total of 94 votes on the first ballot. However, since firm
                            information on how each individual Radical and Christian Democratic
                            congressman will vote is not available, there is no guarantee that this
                            analysis will prove to be correct.</p>
                        <p>d. The consequences for the U.S. under an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> administration were spelled out in <gloss
                                target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 97 which, in part, said, “The
                            election of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would bring
                            to power political forces with the ultimate goal of establishing an
                            authoritarian Marxist state. Long term goals of an <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> administration would thus
                            include suppression of free elections, the state ownership of all or
                            almost all business enterprises, the establishment of state farms, and
                            the imposition of police-backed labor discipline.” In foreign affairs,
                            the <gloss target="#t_NIE_1">NIE</gloss> on Chile dated 30 July 1970
                            said, “On key international issues, which involve any kind of an

                                >Allende</persName> administration would be openly hostile to U.S.

                            the U.S. would have to fund, direct and coordinate the efforts of the

                            Government at the Washington level might also be desirable in order to

                            and the possibility that Alessandri supporters would vote for <persName

                        <p>b. The following electoral situations might not require any action:</p>

                            no matter what his margin of victory might be, informed estimates place
                            a high probability on Alessandri being elected under these

                        <p>(1) stimulate public opinion in such a way that it would bring pressure
                            to bear on Congress not to vote for <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>, and,</p>

                            women and youth organizations so that they may exert grass-root pressure

                            the extent that they can only try to influence those congressmen whom
                            they may know. The military contacts also might issue tailored
                            statements which would intimate that the military might not allow

                            if other covert assets were used; however, these are trusted people and

                                >Allende</persName> in first place, might justify the risks

                        <p>(1) Should the propaganda activities be continued into the congressional

                        <p>1. Summary. The interminable Chilean Presidential campaign ends Thursday
                            noon and after a breather of 20 hours, some 3,100,000 voters are
                            expected to cast ballots Friday. The three candidates are like three
                            castrates acting the part of Casanova, each lustily acclaiming his
                            imminent triumph, each certain only of his lack of an absolute majority.
                            The real issue then is whether any of the three will gain a large enough
                            first majority to convert the congressional runoff of Oct 24th into a
                            formality. Both Alessandri and <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> are genuinely confident of attaining 40 pct;
                                <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> cannot hope now for
                            more than a tight outcome in which he would sneak into second place and
                            thus have the best chance of being elected President; visiting US
                            professors and even some US businessmen foresee <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> emerging as President by this
                            process. The most respected poll predicts a thumping Alessandri triumph;
                            another projects <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> as the
                            winner. The Embassy foresees Alessandri edging <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> with the possibility of a last
                            minute swing of anti-Communist and anti-politiqueria sentiment widening
                            the gap. A close race would create a tense climate in the 50 days before
                            the runoff. (End summary)</p>
                        <p>2. Other South American countries have carnivals; Chile has elections.
                            The Latin nexus between the two is finally self-evident these last few
                            days before the Sept 4th vote. The sexennial exercise in democracy here
                            is now infused with the Carioca’s annual indulgence in passion, release
                            and mystery. After ten official months of stultifying campaign that made
                            Chile “the kingdom of anyplace inhabited by anyone”, Santiago is alive
                            with the movement, with the gay nervousness and the drama that this is a
                            truly fateful choice between democracy and Communism.</p>
                        <p>3. Shortly after midnight this past Sunday (and for 24 more hours) autos
                            began beeping through the capital’s streets, guns were exuberantly
                            discharged and distraught ward heelers scurried through penultimate
                            patterns as the Alessandri forces mounted what later that morning was to
                            be the largest political demonstration in this campaign. <pb n="104"
                                facs="0144" xml:id="pg_104"/>At least one quarter of a million
                            Santiaguinos packed the broad park-and-avenue from the downtown rail
                            station for one-mile to the Fine Arts Museum. The multitude had a
                            festive air for all its heterogenity of well-heeled rubbing shoulders
                            with the great unwashed. It had the confidence of a winning side and the
                            purposefulness of an army that knows public panoply persuades the
                            doubters.</p>
                        <p>4. The strategists behind the 74 year old ex-President are going flat out
                            to create a mood of polarization that would mean death to the hopes of
                            the standard bearer of the Christian Democratic Party, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Radomiro Tomic</persName>, and that would signify
                            the prospects of a clear margin of victory over the Marxist-Leninist
                            forces led for a fourth and final time by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Salvador Allende</persName>, the Socialist doctor. Alessandri’s
                            brain-trust is confident that it has at least 38 pct of the expected
                            3,100,000 voters (of 3,500,000 inscribed) in its pocket. They are aiming
                            at 45 pct so as to obviate any congressional choice in the runoff
                            scheduled for Oct 24th. All signs indicate they have an even-money
                            chance of breaking beyond 40 pct into the clear ground of a definitive
                            margin.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is also confident.
                            Indeed in his unexpected call on President Frei in the middle of last
                            week, he and his commando gave off a bravura of rehearsal for the grand
                            and formal entry on inauguration day. While Frei was much impressed by
                            the aura of victory, he was also moved to remark to a mutual friend that
                            this band of power-seekers had all the attributes of an Indian scalping
                            party; it was, he said, as if the Araucanos (Chile’s Indians) had
                            finally triumphed over the Conquistadores.</p>
                        <p>6. The President is also much affected by the results, still unpublished,
                            of the Hamuy poll. Hamuy, as I have noted previously is a controversial
                            figure who has been paid $150,000 for his election year samplings by the
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> and by govt agencies. Although
                            an adherent of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> in 1964
                            and a bohemian of anarchist belief, he is universally respected in
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> circles as an honest,
                            professional seer. His national figures, I have been repeatedly
                            informed, show <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to be a
                            winner. (His long-delayed poll will probably be published to show
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> neck and neck.) Moreover, we all
                            know that the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> forces are
                            genuinely confident, that they do believe they have at least 40 pct of
                            the vote and that their most serious concern is that somehow this
                            triumph at the polls will be plucked by military intervention. They
                            cannot entertain a calculus that does not begin with the known 39 pct
                            that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> attracted in his
                            1964 race against Frei and with the further known fact that the nominal
                            sum of Popular Unity components total 46 pct. Also on their side they
                            have the unfulfilled aspirations of an awakened mass of poor that equals
                            60 pct of the electorate, an inflationary rate of 30 pct again this
                            year, considerable unemployment and under-employment, the sympathy of
                            possibly a majority of those who influ<pb n="105" facs="0145"
                                xml:id="pg_105"/>ence opinion through the media and the most
                            complete freedom of action in every sector.</p>
                        <p>7. Yet the poll we most respect despite its patronage by Alessandri
                            forces is that of <gloss target="#t_CESEC_1">CESEC</gloss> (Centro de
                            Estudios Socio-Economicos). Most of the front-page of Chile’s lending

                            thunderer of the Alessandri campaign, was devoted Sunday to <gloss

                            <gloss target="#t_CESEC_1">CESEC</gloss>’s sample was taken August 8 to
                            16; it includes the usual caution of possible three percent error. We
                            have checked the methodology of <gloss target="#t_CESEC_1">CESEC</gloss>
                            and are satisfied that it, and more importantly, the accompanying
                            honesty, appear to be beyond doubt.</p>
                        <p>8. Nonetheless there are doubts. Frei has them; I have them. For example
                            this past Saturday after being apprised privately of <gloss
                                target="#t_CESEC_1">CESEC</gloss>’s figures, Frei said he could not
                            accept <gloss target="#t_CESEC_1">CESEC</gloss>’s results for the north
                            that gave Alessandri 47 pct. The President argued that he had worked as
                            editor in and Senator from the north and knew it particularly well. He
                            placed Alessandri third there. Therefore, he concluded, if one area was
                            so misrepresented, he could not accept anything else from <gloss
                                target="#t_CESEC_1">CESEC</gloss>. The Embassy sent one officer to
                            the north last month and his unscientific but competent impressions
                            differ from both Frei’s and <gloss target="#t_CESEC_1">CESEC</gloss>’s;
                            our man in the north found considerable Alessandri strength and he
                            projected the ex-President as a respectable second behind <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> with <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> a poor third.</p>
                        <p>9. The Embassy, incidentally, has its own guesstimates based on a few
                            personal visitations, analysis of past elections and general
                            appreciations. After allowing for a deliberate arithmetical bias in
                            favor of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> wherever there
                            was doubt and equally bearish weighting against the Alessandri fever, it
                            gives Alessandri at least 38 pct, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> 34 pct and <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName> 28 pct. If these projections materialize, Chile
                            will probably have a very difficult 50-days that would be the antithesis
                            of the cooling-off that the writers of the constitution had in mind.</p>
                        <p>10. It is significant that aside from the most loyal of the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> and a few visiting American
                            professors, there are few who think <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName> still has a good shot at the ring. His supporters
                            are parading throughout the city in noisy bands and he too will have his
                            final mass demonstration Wednesday to end the interminable campaign.
                            (All electoral activity is banned for 20 hours preceding the Friday
                            holiday vote and <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> will
                            end his efforts with a Tuesday rally.) Frei still thinks that the race
                            may end with only seven or so percentage points separating first and
                            third. The President is persuaded <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName> has recovered somewhat in <pb n="106" facs="0146"
                                xml:id="pg_106"/>the last fortnight, particularly with women, and
                            that <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> has benefitted from
                            finally concentrating on establishing a link with Frei and his govt’s
                            achievements. He also thinks, as do most high level <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>ers that what the Marxists and the
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> have labelled “the campaign of
                            terror” (the massive anti-Communist propaganda drive launched three
                            months ago by Alessandri’s supporters) has aided <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> considerably; some say is the
                            one element that keeps <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> in
                            contention.</p>
                        <p>11. Indeed, there are scattered indications that women, particularly
                            middle class Santiago females, have been shifting lately towards
                                <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> because of the “terror
                            campaign”. They reason that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> means Communism and that Alessandri signifies
                            violence; hence they conclude that the best chance for tranquility,
                            their over-riding concern, is <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName>. How many calculate in this fashion is difficult
                            to assess. What is certain is that the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> has been focusing on this issue and the female vote.
                            The ladies will surely determine the winner; for the first time they may
                            outnumber (their abstention rate is generally considerably lower) the
                            men who have 200,000 more registered.</p>
                        <p>12. A few hopeful straws in the wind prompted a group of <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>istas last week to announce their
                            acceptance of an equally public challenge by the head of Alessandri’s
                            campaign (Ernesto Pinto) that he was prepared to wager 200,000 escudos
                            ($10,000) <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> would finish
                            third. Campaign headquarters have a busy sideline making election “book”
                            for any who wish to risk a flyer on their favorite. Uncertainty has also
                            been scented in the land of milk and money; Swiss bankers have silently
                            been arriving to be of service in the event of an Alessandri defeat.
                            Liquifying assets has also placed the modest but flourishing saving and
                            loan associations in a difficult squeeze; this sector of Chilean
                            activity has experienced withdrawals equal to six or seven million
                            dollars in the past few months. From this one indicator it would not be
                            rash to reckon that perhaps 30 to 50 times that amount would be
                            available for prompt handling by the friendly Swiss bankers.</p>
                        <p>13. The electorate may well, as befits a democracy, sweep away the
                            uncertainties with a clear verdict Friday. Frei, a man with no penchant
                            for hard decisions and with a proclivity for eternal second thoughts,
                            would prefer, as a French general in Indochina once said, to wait for
                            the solution from above instead of looking for it within oneself. He
                            tells visitors that the military will intervene if <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is President; this
                            deliberately loose talk is probably aimed at persuading voters since
                            there is no reason yet to believe that the military has any such
                            intention nor any such plan, and it is most improbable that Frei would
                            suggest to the armed forces that they upset a democratic result.</p>
                        <p>14. Nonetheless there is a certain rustling of sabers. Gen <persName
                                corresp="#p_VMR_1">Viaux</persName>, retired for his rebellion of
                            last October, is being willingly manipulated by professional plotters,
                            most notably Jorge Prat; his intemperate activity <pb n="107"
                                facs="0147" xml:id="pg_107"/>is probably adding to the divisiveness
                            of an already disunited Army. It would not be surprising if the govt
                            which has infiltrated <persName corresp="#p_VMR_1">Viaux</persName>’
                            circle would employ preventive measures to put <persName
                                corresp="#p_VMR_1">Viaux</persName> on ice if the election results
                            suggested such prudence.</p>
                        <p>15. Without any evidence in support, I believe there are more meaningful
                            talks underway between serious Alessandristas and service leaders. It
                            would not come as a total surprise if the leaders of the Navy, Air Force
                            and Carabineros were to exert pressures on their Army counter-parts to
                            take either symbolic action, in the event of an Alessandri first
                            majority, or to consider other interventionary measures in the event of
                            an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> triumph.</p>
                        <p>16. Other preparations in the political sphere have been made to prepare
                            for these two contingencies. There is increasing evidence of a
                            successful Alessandri operation with the orthodox Radicals. This past
                            week, Sam “fifty” (for thousand) Fuentes, a Radical Deputy who has
                            turned a pretty penny by flip-flopping between <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and Alessandri, announced
                            definitely for the ex-President. Radical Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCA_1">Alberto Baltra</persName>, the disappointed
                            aspirant for the Popular Unity candidacy, sought me out at a social
                            function Friday to display unprecedented friendship and to confide that
                            in his province (Cautin), Alessandri would have an absolute majority, a
                            strange confidence for one of the “leaders” of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> campaign. If the ex-President
                            were to finish first ahead of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>, Alessandri counts on all but one (Miranda) of
                            the seven Radical Senators’ secret ballots and most of the 20 Radical
                            Deputies in the congressional runoff. His advisors are also convinced
                            that at least 20 of the 75 Christian Democrats in the congress would
                            without any doubt vote for Alessandri over <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> while 18 would opt for the Marxist. Hence the
                            nominal lineup of 44 congressional votes for Alessandri and 81 for
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is misleading; a
                            truer reading would be 80 for Alessandri and 83 for <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> with 37 Christian Democrats on
                            the auction block.</p>
                        <p>17. In sum, I am less than confident of Friday’s verdict and am still
                            assailed by doubts ventilated in #5 in this series that herewith
                            ends.</p>

                        <p>The winner in the congressional runoff could have as few as 51 votes. A
                            quorum of only 101 members of Congress is necessary for the first ballot
                            and, in order to win, a candidate must receive a majority of the votes
                            of those present. If there is a tie, another vote is taken immediately.
                            If this does not produce a majority, another vote is taken the next day
                            and the winner needs only a majority of any number which attends and
                            votes at that time.</p>
                        <p>Congress has always chosen the top presidential vote-getter on the three
                            other occasions in this century when no candidate received the required
                            majority of the popular vote. This time is not likely to be an
                            exception. In fact, before the election, Alessandri stated flatly that
                            he would not accept the presidency if he did not win a popular plurality
                            or a majority. His history of stubborn rigidity suggests that he is not
                            likely to change his mind, or to lend himself now to deals by others to
                            head off an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> presidency.
                            However, some of his backers have urged him not to concede and he has
                            not yet done so.</p>
                        <p>The time between now and the congressional vote on 24 October is sure to
                            be a period of intense political pressures and complex maneu<pb n="110"
                                facs="0150" xml:id="pg_110"/>vering as contending political groups
                            seek to secure their objectives. The most likely end result, however,
                            will be that a decisive number of leftist Christian Democratic members
                            of Congress will swing to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>. Defeated Christian Democratic presidential
                            candidate <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Radomiro Tomic</persName>, who
                            had hoped to lead a unified leftist coalition including the Communists,
                            is likely to urge this course on his party followers. This move would be
                            rationalized by the hope, almost certainly unfounded, that the Christian
                            Democrats could thus prevent the disciplined Communist Party from
                            dominating the next administration. It could also be justified by the
                            fact that many of <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>’s
                            policies are identical or very similar to those propounded by <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. The blatantly opportunistic
                            Radicals, already nominally in <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s camp, will have no reason to desert him at
                            this point.</p>
                        <p>There is an outside possibility that lame duck President Frei might
                            attempt a political maneuver aimed at denying <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> the presidency. One scheme,
                            which has been rumored and subsequently denied in clandestine reporting,
                            would involve an effort by Frei to swing the Christian Democrats to
                            Alessandri in the congressional vote. Alessandri would, by prior secret
                            agreement, resign the presidency some months after taking office. New
                            presidential elections would constitutionally be required and Frei could
                            himself be a candidate. Frei’s continued personal popularity might bring
                            him victory and a new term in the presidency. This complex scheme, or
                            any possible variation of it, would be most likely to collapse before it
                            got far. It is doubtful that Frei could swing such a maneuver or now has
                            the taste to try. He appears totally disheartened and in a near state of
                            shock over the outcome of the election.</p>
                        <p>If, by any chance, Alessandri should be named president by Congress, the
                            result would most likely be an upsurge of violent reaction by <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> supporters. The armed forces
                            would be hard pressed to contain the violence and might not succeed.</p>

                        <p>The traditional sources of power in Chile have been weakened in recent
                            years and most of them are beset with internal differences. All of them
                            are affected by the fact that well before last Friday’s election Chile
                            as a nation and a society had already turned clearly toward a statist
                            economic course and a leftist and nationalist political course. This has
                            quickened under Frei, despite his moderate predilections. Perhaps as
                            important has been the fact that traditional power groups have not
                            combined to hold their own, or even sought very hard to do so.</p>

                                facs="0151" xml:id="pg_111"/>averted a substantial growth of leftist
                            influence at all ranks. It has even been penetrated by revolutionary
                            extremists. The Army has been profoundly affected by the uprising in one
                            of its units in October 1969 and the resentments which led to the revolt
                            have not been really resolved. The effects have been to divide and
                            weaken, rather than to give a common purpose, and the Army’s pride,
                            discipline, and proficiency have all continued to erode. Many generals
                            reveal deep uncertainties and mistrust of each other’s motives and

                            officers of these small services, would like to resist an <persName

                        <p>The uniformed national police, the <hi rend="italic">carabineros</hi>,
                            are a well-armed and well-disciplined force which is a little larger
                            than the Army and there is strong rivalry between them. The <hi

                            responsibility of defending the constitutionally elected government.
                            Although their commandant under Frei is strongly conservative, he is
                            already a lame duck and it is doubtful whether he could lead the force
                            to back a move against <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>

                        </p>
                        <p>Much of the leadership of the Roman Catholic Church in Chile has long
                            been in the vanguard of the progressive movement within the churches of
                            Latin America. Individual churchmen frequently speak and act in ways
                            which would be considered subversive in such countries as Brazil and
                            Colombia. Many radical Christian Democrats are close to the Church and
                            the numerous influential Catholic universities and secondary schools are
                            strongly influenced and frequently dominated by committed leftists. In
                            this election the Church did not openly support either <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> or Alessandri, although most of
                            its members were probably divided between the two. Some radical
                            churchmen backed <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>.
                            Additionally, it should be remembered that a smaller proportion of
                            Chileans are even nominal Catholics than is the case of most Latin
                            American countries.</p>

                        <p>The economic power not wielded by the Chilean government through its
                            extensive participation in business and industrial enterprises is
                            concentrated in the hands of a few people. Most of them backed
                            Alessandri, although some of the freewheeling ones tried to keep lines
                            open to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. Frei originally
                            had the support of many businessmen, but it diminished during his six
                            years of extensive reforms and <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName> made small effort to regain their confidence. Many
                            economically powerful Chileans have always kept large holdings <pb

                            the country rather than risk the chance that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> will not carry out the
                            extensive expropriations he has promised, many of specific companies.
                            Smaller businessmen and industrialists who have no choice but to stay
                            will probably try to accommodate <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s policies as long as they manage not to be
                            squeezed out. Few Chilean businessmen, small or large, have had a good
                            word for any government in recent years, even Alessandri’s. The large
                            daily <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> speaks for the economically
                            influential and <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has made

                            of his major targets. The many subsidiary newspapers, publishing and
                            other firms, as well as the banks owned by the Edwards family will
                            probably be taken over or forced to the wall by taxation or other means.
                            A major rallying point and voice will thus be eliminated as fast as
                            possible and others with less resources will be treated similarly.</p>
                        <p>The major economic resource of Chile, its copper mines, are already
                            partly nationalized and <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            will probably move quickly to fulfill his promise to take full control
                            of them. Their recent expansion, largely through US investment and
                            technical expertise, will provide Chile with an assured income, despite
                            recent decline in world copper prices. This, combined with current large
                            credit reserves, will give an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> government wide latitude of action.</p>

                            Marxist government. Non-Marxist leaders in the large Chilean Labor

                            are heightened by an obsession with independence and the plethora of

                        <p>If Congress declares <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> the
                            victor on 24 October, the odds would strongly favor his inauguration on
                            schedule on 4 November. The possibility of a military power play exists,
                            but it is too early to assess the chances of success, particularly in
                            view of the reasons discussed above. The Army commander’s pre-election
                            statement that he would respect the decision of Congress even if it
                            selected the man with the second largest number of votes was not
                            universally supported by top military leaders. However, in the present
                            context armed forces leaders could see it as a way to avert an <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government. Even if a military
                            take-over were to be attempted, with or without the connivance of
                            President Frei, the probable reaction would be serious and sustained
                            violence by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s partisans
                            that might ultimately prove beyond the power of the armed forces to
                            suppress.</p>
                        <p>The chances of a military coup would, of course, increase in the period
                            before the inauguration if there were to be a major outbreak of
                            violence. Political forces to the right of the <persName

                            ability or the inclination to resort to sustained violence, and they
                            would have little popular support if they tried. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and his chief backers,
                            particularly the Communists, can be expected to do everything in their
                            power to prevent and to avoid the provocation of pre-inauguration
                            violence. The extremists on the far left, who have denounced <persName

                            pursuing the peaceful road to power, have lain low in recent weeks. They
                            were encouraged to do so by <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel
                                Castro</persName>, who warned them that they might endanger an

                            revolutionaries, however, have become increasingly capable and

                            discussed at length in the response to <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1"
                                >NSSM</gloss> #97, dated 18 August 1970. Nothing has happened to

                        <p>In sum, we would expect an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> government to move gradually and cautiously
                            toward the establishment of an authoritarian Marxist state. To this end,
                            it would seek to destroy, neutralize, or obtain the support of the
                            various groups and institutions which might block its progress. Some
                            groups, most notably the security forces, would be <pb n="114"
                                facs="0154" xml:id="pg_114"/>watching <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> closely, and could move to overthrow him if he
                            were seen flagrantly flouting the constitution or threatening the
                            military’s institutional interests. Divisions and uncertainties within
                            and among these groups, however, mean that a sufficiently gradualist and
                            skillful approach by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            could avoid provoking the military almost indefinitely. On this basis,
                            time would enable <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to
                            entrench himself ever more firmly in power.</p>
                        <p>Internationally, we see as one of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s goals the extirpation of U.S. influence from
                            Chile. While we expect him to try to avoid a serious provocation of the
                            U.S., his promised actions, including the expropriation of the U.S.
                            copper companies, raise to a high level the probability of some kind of
                            confrontation with us. We take at face value <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s platform promises to
                            “denounce” the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>, to intensify
                            relations with socialist countries and to establish close ties with
                            Cuba. Expansion of the Soviet presence in Chile could occur in many
                            different ways, but we believe the establishment of a major permanent
                            Soviet military presence to be unlikely but not impossible. We also
                            believe <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would
                            probably—and almost certainly in the period in which he was trying to
                            consolidate himself—avoid the risks of discernible Chilean subversion in
                            other countries.</p>
                        <p>Regarding threats to U.S. interests, we conclude that:</p>
                        <p>1. The U.S. has no vital national interests within Chile. There would,
                            however, be tangible economic losses.</p>
                        <p>2. The world military balance of power would not be significantly altered
                            by an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government.</p>
                        <p>3. An <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> victory would,
                            however, create considerable political and psychological costs:</p>
                        <p>a. Hemispheric cohesion would be threatened by the challenge that an
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government would
                            pose to the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>, and by the reactions
                            that it would create in other countries. We do not see, however, any
                            likely threat to the peace of the region.</p>
                        <p>b. An <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> victory would
                            represent a definite psychological set-back to the U.S. and a definite
                            psychological advance for the Marxist idea.</p>

                        <p>The following actions have been taken in response to the President’s
                            instructions of 15 September 1970:</p>
                        <p>1. Organizational:</p>
                        <p>a. Two special operating units have been organized at Agency Headquarters
                            and were in operation by 18 September. Both units will operate within
                            the Agency under the cover of the 40 Committee approval of 14 September
                            for political action.</p>
                        <p>b. Three Chiefs of Station have been recalled, two arrived in Washington
                            on 18 September to serve as Chief and Deputy Chief of one of the special
                            operating units which will be known as the military unit of the task
                            force.</p>
                        <p>c. [<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (4½ lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>d. The original 40 Committee program group has also been augmented by the
                            addition of two officers. This unit will continue to function from the
                            present quarters of the Chile Desk to provide support for the 40
                            Committee program.</p>
                        <p>2. Political/Economic: </p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">2 paragraphs (13 lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>c. The Communists have been conducting an intensive campaign to gain
                            control of all media in Chile before the election run-off. <hi
                                rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> has been a key target. All of our
                                [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] Stations
                                [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] have been
                            advised of this campaign and instructed to generate press support for
                                <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio’s</hi> position of resistance to
                            pressures of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>d. Our Station Chief in Santiago has indirect contact with various
                            Chilean military leaders [<hi rend="italic">1 line not
                            declassified</hi>]. There is a clear evidence of possible coup plans
                            which call for President Frei’s authorization to take the following
                            steps:</p>
                        <pb n="116" facs="0156" xml:id="pg_116"/>
                        <p>(1) Resignation of the Cabinet,</p>
                        <p>(2) Formation of the new Cabinet composed entirely of military
                            figures,</p>
                        <p>(3) Appointment by Frei of an acting President,</p>
                        <p>(4) Frei’s departure from Chile.</p>
                        <p>The success of such a coup would ultimately depend on Frei’s total
                            commitment to follow through.</p>
                        <p>e. Agency representatives debriefed [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not
                                declassified</hi>] as part of a continuing attempt to identify
                            possible military leads and economic vulnerabilities.</p>
                        <p>f. Two senior staff officers have arranged to meet with [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] to brief him
                            on the Chilean situation and to ask him to contact [<hi rend="italic"
                                >name not declassified</hi>] and obtain his support in persuading
                            his counterpart in Chile from taking any public action to endorse
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. Propaganda:</p>
                        <p>a. A series of guidance cables have been sent [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line not declassified</hi>] urging them to attempt to
                            generate press response in their respective countries which is intended
                            to:</p>
                        <p>(1) help create an atmosphere of hope that an alternative to a Marxist
                            government in Chile will be found;</p>
                        <p>(2) avoid premature acceptance by the general public of an <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            <hi rend="italic">fait accompli</hi>;</p>
                        <p>(3) convince Chileans that a majority of their fellow Latins are
                            concerned, watchful, and hopeful that an appropriate solution can be
                            found;</p>
                        <p>(4) generate support for the efforts of <hi rend="italic">El
                                Mercurio’s</hi> owners and publishers to continue to fight to bring
                            about <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s defeat;</p>
                        <p>(5) make a maximum effort to exploit through all media assets the
                            reported campaign which the Communists are conducting to gain control of
                            all media in Chile prior to the election run-off.</p>
                        <p>b. Guidance cables were also sent to selected European Stations
                            requesting appropriate support of the above noted objectives.</p>
                        <p>c. A paper has been prepared for the Director proposing that he contact
                                [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] to enlist his support
                            in having [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]
                            assist <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> and expose the Communists
                            campaign to control the media of Chile.</p>
                        <p>d. We are exploring ways in which [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] to determine how [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                line not declassified</hi>] might bring its influence to bear on the
                            Chilean situation.</p>
                        <p>e. [<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (5½ lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>f. [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>] we are exploring
                            the possibility of having the Brazilian and Argentine military
                            discreetly encourage the Chilean Army to take action to prevent
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s succession.</p>
                        <pb n="117" facs="0157" xml:id="pg_117"/>
                        <p>g. In a continuing effort to identify possible economic pressure points
                            we have enlisted the support of experts from various components of the
                            Agency.</p>
                        <p>h. Upon receipt of the intelligence from our Santiago Station indicating
                            that a possible military coup was developing, a cable was sent to <gloss
                                target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>, Santiago indicating he should
                            discreetly encourage such a movement.</p>
                        <p>i. We are in the process of contacting [<hi rend="italic">3 lines not
                                declassified</hi>] who [<hi rend="italic">1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] will be sounded out on any possibilites for
                            discreet recontact of Frei by him personally. If that is possible, we
                            would hope to use him to stiffen Frei’s resolve to keep an <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government from coming into
                            power.</p>

                        <p>At opera night 18 Sept Ambassador chatted briefly during intermission
                            with President Frei under watchful eyes diplomatic corps including
                            Soviet Ambassador. Frei whispered that Ambassador must see <persName

                            would be Tuesday, 22 Sept, since nothing would happen over weekend.
                            German and Italian Ambassadors later commented to Ambassador that Frei
                            very pessimistic about <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> changes in
                            Congress and that Frei was “desperate” about situation in Chile.</p>

                            in Chile.” While reflecting White House views, the text and substance
                            are not repeat not to be repeated publicly.</p>
                        <p>3. Text of backgrounder follows:</p>
                        <pb n="119" facs="0159" xml:id="pg_119"/>
                        <p>Quote: The election in Chile brought about a result in which the man
                            backed by the Communists, and probably a Communist himself, had the
                            largest number of votes by 30,000 over the next man, who was a
                            conservative. He had about 36.1 per cent of the votes. So he had a
                            plurality.</p>
                        <p>4. Qte: The two non-Communist parties between them had, of course, 64 per
                            cent of the votes, so there is a non-Communist majority, but a Communist
                            plurality. I say that just to get the picture straight.</p>
                        <p>5. Qte: According to the Chilean election law, when nobody gets a
                            majority, the two highest candidates go to the Congress. The Congress
                            then votes in a secret ballot and elects the President. That election is
                            October 24th. In Chilean history, there is nothing to prevent it, and it
                            would not be at all illogical for the Congress to say, “sixty-four
                            percent of the people did not want a Communist government. A Communist
                            government tends to be irreversible. Therefore, we are going to vote for
                            the no. 2 man. This is perfectly within their constitutional
                            prerogatives. However, the constitutional habit has developed that
                            Congress votes for the man that gets the highest number of votes. But
                            then, of course, it has never happened before that the man with the
                            highest number of votes happens to represent a non-democratic party,
                            which tends to make his election pretty irreversible. I have yet to meet
                            somebody who firmly believes that if <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> wins there is likely to be another free election
                            in Chile.</p>
                        <p>6. Qte: So this is the situation that is now confronted by Chile. By a
                            constitutional habit, the Congress votes for the man with the highest
                            number of votes. The man with the highest number of votes is the
                            candidate backed by the Communists.</p>
                        <p>7. Qte: There is the additional problem that the Congress is not elected
                            at the same time as the President, so in the Congress, as it now stands,
                            the total number of seats is 200. The group that backs <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, including the Communists, has
                            82 seats, so that all <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            has to do is pick up 19 seats from the other parties, and he will be in.
                            The conservative candidate, that is, the no. 2 candidate, around whom
                            the rallying would have to take place, has only about 45 seats. So he
                            would have to pick up 56 or something like that to make it.</p>
                        <p>8. Qte: So both the internal structure of the Congress, plus
                            constitutional habits, would argue that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> is likely to win the congressional election,
                            barring something extraordinary. This problem is compounded by the fact
                            that the non-Communist parties in Chile have been very divided among
                            themselves, and you have the unusual phenomenon of people arguing,
                            “well, maybe <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> won’t be so
                            bad. Maybe he will run a democratic system”. And it is the usual
                            revolutionary dilemma that, with a revolutionary seeking power, those
                            who represent the non-revolutionary side do not all at the same time
                            clearly <pb n="120" facs="0160" xml:id="pg_120"/>understand what is
                            happening. Therefore you have a great deal of confusion in Chile.</p>
                        <p>9. Qte: Now, it is fairly easy for one to predict that if <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> wins, there is a good chance
                            that he will establish over a period of years some sort of Communist
                            government. In that case you would have one not on an island off the
                            coast which has not a traditional relationship and impact on Latin
                            America, but in a major Latin American country you would have a
                            Communist government, joining, for example, Argentina, which is already
                            deeply divided, along a long frontier, joining Peru, which has already
                            been heading in directions that have been difficult to deal with, and
                            joining Bolivia, which has also gone in a more leftist, anti-U.S.
                            direction, even without any of these developments.</p>
                        <p>10. Qte: So I don’t think we should delude ourselves that an <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> take-over in Chile would not
                            present massive problems for us, and for democratic forces and for
                            pro-U.S. forces in Latin America, and indeed to the whole Western
                            Hemisphere. What would happen to the Western Hemisphere Defense Board,
                            or to the Organization of American States, and so forth, is extremely
                            problematical. So we are taking a close look at the situation. It is not
                            one in which our capability for influence is very great at this
                            particular moment now that matters have reached this particular
                            point.</p>
                        <p>11. Qte: But you asked me about what the situation is. It is one of those
                            situations which is not too happy for American interests. End qte.</p>

                        <p>B. [<hi rend="italic">codename not declassified</hi>] (Track Two)—this is
                            authority granted [<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>] only, to work
                            toward a military solution to problem. As part of authority we were
                            explicitly told that [40 Committee], State, Ambassador and Embassy were
                            not to be told of this Track Two nor involved in it in any manner.</p>
                        <p>3. Your suggestion of having Station urge (repeat having Station urge)
                                <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> to visit Frei and
                            suggest military solution is excellent and would be workable if we were
                            working in tandem. We are not. Thus, would be tantamount to having
                                <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> act as unwitting agent
                            in implementing Track Two of which he is not aware and is not to be made
                            aware. If he decides to defy Department instructions and act on his own
                            that is his affair but Station cannot be responsible for pushing him in
                            that direction since would be violation of our [<hi rend="italic"
                                >codename not declassified</hi>] instructions [<hi rend="italic"
                                >less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]. You can if you wish urge
                                <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> in most generic terms
                            to pay personal visit on Frei but you should not suggest scenario to him
                            in line with ref b above for obvious reasons.</p>
                        <p>4. Hence, being deprived of use of <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName> as spearhead into Frei we have decided, [<hi

                        <p>5. [<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (15 lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>

                        <p>7. Again urge you to understand that in relations with Ambassador you are
                            limited to actions outlined in <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1"
                                >Johnson</persName> cable and should not give <hi rend="italic"
                                >any</hi> indication of existence of [Track Two.] If we confronted
                            with changed circumstances, we may alter these instructions.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. In the course of 20 September, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName> exchanged views about the Chilean situation and
                            about available courses of action to deny <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> the presidency, with Minister of Economy
                                <persName corresp="#p_FSC_1">Carlos Figueroa</persName> and with
                            Minister of Defense <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1">Sergio Ossa</persName>.
                            Both enjoy the personal confidence of President Frei and both belong to
                            an informal working group within the cabinet, composed of five cabinet
                            ministers who are convinced that steps need to be taken to prevent
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s election by
                            congress. The following five cabinet ministers belong to the
                            aforementioned group</p>
                        <p>a. <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1">Sergio Ossa</persName>, Minister of
                            Defense</p>
                        <p>b. <persName corresp="#p_TCR_1">Raul Troncoso</persName>, Minister
                            without Portfolio</p>
                        <p>c. <persName corresp="#p_FSC_1">Carlos Figueroa</persName>, Minister of
                            Economy</p>

                            Finance</p>
                        <p>e. Patricio Rojas, Minister of Interior.</p>
                        <p>2. The following three cabinet ministers have evinced the same deep
                            concern over the situation, but have not been invited to join the inner
                            group (because of their relatively minor utility) and therefore not
                            privy to any action plans:</p>
                        <p>a. Andres Donoso, Minister of Housing</p>
                        <p>b. Eduardo Leon, Minister of Labor</p>
                        <p>c. Ramon Valdivieso, Minister of Health.</p>
                        <p>3. Ministers of Mines <persName corresp="#p_HJA_1">Alejandro
                                Hales</persName> and Maximo Pacheco appear resigned to <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s advent, but doubt that he
                            will last. Pacheco’s wife (a relative of Alessandri’s) “is working on
                            him.” Minister of Agriculture Hugo Trivelli is “completely lost as
                            usual.” <persName corresp="#p_VSG_1">Gabriel Valdes</persName> is trying
                            to save his political skin, keeping links open to <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> with <pb n="123" facs="0163"
                                xml:id="pg_123"/>whom, however, he has not aligned himself openly
                            yet. Minister of Justice <persName corresp="#p_LMG_1">Gustavo
                                Lagos</persName> is an avowed follower of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s.</p>
                        <p>4. According to <persName corresp="#p_FSC_1">Figueroa</persName>, both he
                            and his colleague <persName corresp="#p_ZLA_1">Zaldivar</persName> are
                            prepared to resign, but are doubtful about Frei’s willingness to use
                            their resignation as excuse to precipitate a constitutional crisis.
                            Should they resign, the collegiate principle would apply and all other
                            members of the cabinet would put in their resignation. Both are
                            concerned lest their resignation be considered an act of cowardice and
                            of abandonment of Frei. (In this context, <persName corresp="#p_FSC_1"
                                >Figueroa</persName> emphasized Frei’s well known propensity for
                            letting others make the painful decisions). What would happen if Frei
                            invites the military to fill the vacant cabinet posts and the military
                            decline? Then <persName corresp="#p_FSC_1">Figueroa</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZLA_1">Zaldivar</persName> would look like the
                            proverbial rats abandoning the ship and the full blame would fall on
                            them. <persName corresp="#p_FSC_1">Figueroa</persName> doubts whether
                            his and <persName corresp="#p_ZLA_1">Zaldivar</persName>’s resignation
                            would, by itself, trigger national crisis. It may take one or two months
                            before the Chilean people feel the full impact of inflation and
                            unemployment. Hence, their departure from public office would dramatize
                            a situation whose effects have not as yet made themselves felt. Some
                            businessmen are already trying to make their peace with <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>.</p>
                        <p>5. The inner group has been receiving the economic analytical support of
                            Cauas, Molina and <persName corresp="#p_MAC_1">Massad</persName>, none
                            of whom are in on the secret. <persName corresp="#p_MAC_1"
                                >Massad</persName> is on record in the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss>’s “Economic Committee” as refusing to lend himself to
                            inflationary solutions of the type advocated by <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s economic liaison man,
                                <persName corresp="#p_VBP_1">Vuskovic</persName>, who has been
                            pushing a formula of virtually unlimited credit and recourse to the
                            printing press in order to make up the currency shortages.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_FSC_1">Figueroa</persName> denied any knowledge
                            of direct talks between Frei and the leadership of the three armed
                            services. He further doubted that the military had been apprised of the
                            fact that Frei considers a parliamentary solution as no longer feasible.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FSC_1">Figueroa</persName> did not challenge
                            the logic of the Ambassador’s observation that, inasmuch as several
                            foreign ambassadors had been so advised, there was no compelling reason
                            for keeping General <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName>,
                                <gloss target="#t_CINC_1">CINC</gloss> Army, in the dark. The
                            Ambassador therefore urged <persName corresp="#p_FSC_1"
                                >Figueroa</persName> to prevail on Frei to have a private talk with
                                <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName> and then with the
                            rest of the military to put them in the picture.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_FSC_1">Figueroa</persName> was interested in
                            learning the Ambassador’s views about the state of mind among the junior
                            ranks of the officer corps. He was told that some junior officers were
                            reportedly fed to the teeth and that there was obvious danger of rash
                            acts on their part, or of ultra-rightists, such as an attempt against
                            the life of Frei.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_FSC_1">Figueroa</persName> urged the Ambassador
                            to get word to the military promptly that, with <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> waiting in the wings,
                            relations between the United States and Chile were bound to undergo
                            drastic change and <pb n="124" facs="0164" xml:id="pg_124"/>that any
                            flow of military equipment was bound to end. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FSC_1">Figueroa</persName> further agreed that the
                            cancellation of further official visits by Chilean military to the
                            United States would have a salutary effect. The Ambassador, in turn
                            suggested that <persName corresp="#p_ZLA_1">Zaldivar</persName>’s
                            impending address on the economic situation of Chile make general
                            mention of the laws of the United States which would have to be invoked
                            in case of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s election
                            and program implementation and similarly allude to the fact that the
                            West German Government has already proceeded to cut off certain types of
                            aid. <persName corresp="#p_FSC_1">Figueroa</persName> agreed to pass on
                            this suggestion, mentioning in passing that the Japanese had cancelled
                            an agreement to grant certain credits for military purchases and that
                            the impact of this move upon the military, who live in a dream world,
                            had been considerable. Word should be gotten to the military that they
                            will not be able to purchase spare parts.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_FSC_1">Figueroa</persName> expressed doubt that
                            the thought of leaving Chile had as yet entered Frei’s mind. He had no
                            cavil with the Ambassador’s observation that this might be a good time
                            to think about that eventuality, unless Frei had resigned himself to
                            personally handing the sash of office to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>. Hopefully, the Ambassador remarked, Frei would
                            remember that it was he and not <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Radomiro
                                Tomic</persName> who handed over Chile to a Communist regime. Either
                            Frei believed in <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            accession as a realistic prospect or he did not. In the latter case,
                            there was obviously only one avenue open.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_FSC_1">Figueroa</persName> asked the
                            Ambassador’s opinion as to what, if anything, could be done once
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> was in power. The
                            Ambassador’s reply was “nothing.” If confronted with a choice to ease
                            Chile’s economic plight under an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> regime, or hasten economic collapse thereby
                            forcing <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to adopt the
                            harsh features of a police state earlier than planned, the Ambassador
                            would not hesitate to opt for and see to it that, economically speaking,
                            Chile would go to hell faster.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_FSC_1">Figueroa</persName> quoted the <gloss
                                target="#t_PCCh_1">PCCh</gloss> as holding out the promise of prompt
                            Soviet help. The Ambassador voiced doubts about the validity of that
                            boast, but pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_FSC_1"
                                >Figueroa</persName> that any additional drain on Soviet resources
                            would obviously redound to the global benefit of the United States.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FSC_1">Figueroa</persName> opined that if the
                            military were to put on a show of force in Santiago there would be no
                            civil war and that the majority of the Chilean people preferred
                            tranquility at any price.</p>

                        <p>3824. For Chiefs of Mission only. Subj: Frei: Transacting the Future
                            (Part I of II Parts).</p>
                        <p>1. There are now 33 days left before the Oct. 24th Congressional runoff
                            that will decide Chile’s future if there are no intervening surprises.
                            In the 17 days since the Marxist <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> won a plurality, little on the surface has
                            changed. The country is calm; the armed forces are acting the part of
                            sturdy guardian of the Constitution; the economy is damaged but a great
                            deal of business goes on as usual; Frei plays his aloof public role of
                            President of all Chileans.</p>
                        <p>2. Beneath this surface calm, there has been a significant amount of
                            movement on both sides, by those who wish to establish a
                            Marxist-Leninist state and by those opposed to it; and equally important
                            there is kind of dialogue between these two protagonists. What follows
                            is the view of one observer who has handicapped his perception by
                            limiting his Mission’s contacts to only those who seek us out; there are
                            no longer many of those but we believe we are well-informed.</p>
                        <p>3. Frei remains the central figure. His moves determine the pace, the
                            direction and the form of a situation that has far more flux than 99.99
                            pct of the Chileans know. His style is that of all politicians—of
                            transaction. Transaction signifies mobility, maneuverability and
                            manipulation. The three materials that the President is trying to mould
                            into some coherent form are the public, the army and the parties.</p>
                        <p>4. With the public, Frei is seeking, rather successfully, to safeguard
                            his popularity and their confidence. He wants tranquillity in the
                            streets while he pursues his political goals; he wants to avoid any
                            perturbing, and more importantly, any unexpected developments that could
                            upset his manner of doing things. He wants to maintain an aura of
                            government control of the situation, of the seriousness of his
                            ministers, of the correctness of their actions in handling the deepening
                            problems of <pb n="126" facs="0166" xml:id="pg_126"/>the economy. For
                            example, if he were to precipitate closings of factories and enterprises
                            by deliberately squeezing credit, he would be very vulnerable to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> accusation of
                            showing panic for political purposes and he would run the undoubted risk
                            of provoking reactions for which he is not yet prepared.</p>
                        <p>5. With the armed forces, Frei has been using the Minister of Defense,
                            his trusted intimate, <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1">Sergio
                                Ossa</persName> while avoiding any direct or frank communication.
                            Having established before the election the so-called <persName
                                corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName> doctrine (named after the
                            Army CINC) of strict constitutionalism, the President is corseted by the
                            tight application that <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName>
                            gives to his profound belief in the apolitical role of the Chilean
                            military. <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName> emphasized
                            his doctrine in his Sept. 19th Independence Day message to the army
                            while Frei’s declaration that day had much more subtlety and amibiguity
                            (Santiago 3807). <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName> wants
                            no options that would invite armed forces to undo what the politicians
                            have wrought in Chile; Frei detests closed doors as much as unequivocal
                            decisions.</p>
                        <p>6. Hence the task of “educating” the armed forces has been assigned to
                                <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1">Ossa</persName> in the first instance.
                            Because Frei was sincerely fearful of an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> electoral triumph, <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1"
                                >Ossa</persName>’s main task in the past 11 months that he has held
                            his post, has been to gain the confidence of the officer corps, to size
                            up each general and admiral, and to forge a semblance of unity among a
                            military scarred by the fallout of last October’s army sitdown strike,
                            by partisan Presidential preferences and by career and service
                            competitiveness. <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1">Ossa</persName>, too, has
                            been “rather successful” in these tasks. In the 17 days since the
                            election, he has been trying to thread the ribbon between <persName
                                corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName>’s constitutionalism and
                            Frei’s consternation over the prospects of an <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> Presidency. <persName
                                corresp="#p_OPS_1">Ossa</persName> has been planting doubts about
                            the survivability of democracy in Chile, about the future status of the
                            armed forces, about the links between Chile and the non-Communist world.
                            He has been postulating alternatives that are designed to make the armed
                            forces reflect and to provoke them into consideration of
                            alternatives.</p>
                        <p>7. The declaration last week by General <persName corresp="#p_VMR_1"
                                >Viaux</persName>, the leader of last year’s strike, included the
                            hand of <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1">Ossa</persName> (read Frei) as well
                            as those rightists who wish to prevent <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> from assuming power by a typical Latin <gloss
                                target="#t_golpe_1">golpe</gloss>. It has the effect of uniting the
                            armed forces and of reinforcing the notion of a special role for the
                            military in political context. Since then, the high command has also
                            reached another significant if still not determinant conclusion—that it
                            would be prepared to confront a popular uprising—the civil war threat
                            pinned to the Marxist standard—in defense of the constitution. Still
                            more recently, the armed forces have had a whiff of the possibility of a
                            cabinet shuffle in which the military might have to assume a number of
                            ministerial posts under <pb n="127" facs="0167" xml:id="pg_127"/>Frei
                            and which, just might by chance, convert <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1"
                                >Schneider</persName> from the dominant immobilizing force in the
                            military to just another cabinet minister. Whether these are more of
                            Frei’s Swiss soundings or part of a skillful scheme is not yet
                            certain.</p>
                        <p>8. The action that would spark the shuffling of military into the
                            government deck would be a report to the nation this week by the
                            Minister of Finance, <persName corresp="#p_ZLA_1">Andres
                                Zaldivar</persName>. He and his close associate Minister of Economy
                                <persName corresp="#p_FSC_1">Carlos Figueroa</persName>, have
                            ostensibly been preparing the past few days a “technical” report on the
                            state of the economy for the President. They have been aided by teams of
                            specialists on each sector of the economy. All participating in this
                            “study” are bound by only one glue—their total opposition to <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. The motivation for the
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZLA_1">Zaldivar</persName> report would be the
                            truly damaging effects of the post-electoral reaction to the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> plurality—the enormous public
                            liquidity that resulted from massive govt support to banks, savings and
                            loan associations and to businesses, the reluctance of consumers to buy
                            or to save, the downturn in production, the closing of some businesses
                            and the flight of technical and managerial talents.</p>
                        <p>9. If such a message is to be delivered to the nation, Frei must
                            calculate the effects very finely indeed. He does not wish to provoke a
                            panic; he does not wish to expose himself too much politically to the
                            charge of political motivation; he does not wish to affect the public’s,
                            the parties’ and the military’s awareness of alternatives; he does wish
                            to ripen the situation a little, but not too much, to increase his
                            overall leverage. The critical questions he must answer—and I believe he
                            is formulating his judgments today—is whether he can justify the
                            sobering economic report and whether that report would justify the
                            resignations of <persName corresp="#p_ZLA_1">Zaldivar</persName> and of
                                <persName corresp="#p_FSC_1">Figueroa</persName>. Both these
                            gentlemen are ready to resign if Frei gives the green light; the
                            military is ready to assume portfolios that would flow from the
                            collective resignation of the entire cabinet.</p>
                        <p>10. An indispensable ingredient in this package would be the inclusion of
                                <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName> in the new
                            cabinet. His displacement would permit the naming to the army <gloss
                                target="#t_CINC_1">CINC</gloss> slot of a general less disposed to
                            “constitutionalism” and more determined in his opposition to <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. The next in line to <persName
                                corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName> would be Chief of Staff Gen.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PGC_1">Prats</persName>, who would meet these
                            qualifications but there are other candidates under consideration. The
                            service chiefs in considering this possibility have stated they wished
                            to keep <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1">Ossa</persName> as Min Defense and
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZLA_1">Zaldivar</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_FSC_1">Figueroa</persName> as “technicians” in fields in
                            which they confess their total ignorance. Unlike Peru, the Chilean
                            military does not have to assume a quasi-revolutionary role of great
                            reformers since the politicians have a monopoly on that field. Thus the
                            military might not assume more than a few portfolios, if this scenario
                            were to be Frei’s choice; Interior, Labor, Health, Public Works would be
                            probable designations. I cannot repress <pb n="128" facs="0168"
                                xml:id="pg_128"/>my profound hope that Frei would name <persName

                            in place of <persName corresp="#p_VSG_1">Gabriel Valdes</persName>, the

                            Frei can ever bring himself to break with his lifetime friend and

                            nation last night excellently prepared and designed to worsen bad
                            situation. (I sent Santiago 3882 unclassified so that Washington can, if
                            it so decides, give widest distribution to U.S. press and more
                            importantly business and banking community.)</p>
                        <p>2. Frei has ruled out cabinet resignations for the time being. Pretext is
                            that if military entered government they would probably only do nothing
                            more than assure a constitutional process that would elect <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. Frei met with Army <gloss target="#t_CINC_1">CINC</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName> alone (see
                            TDCS–DB–315/05028–70), yesterday and did exactly what Minister of
                            Defense <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1">Ossa</persName> had said to me
                            Sunday he would get Frei to do:</p>
                        <p>a. Disabuse <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName> of any hope
                            in the congressional formula;</p>
                        <p>b. Inform <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName> it was
                            military or nothing;</p>
                        <p>c. Tell <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName> that Marxist
                            government would probably provoke end to U.S. military aid;</p>
                        <p>d. Frei would give similar briefing to other military.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName> interpreted Frei to
                            mean support for his constitutionalist doctrine. He has convoked “Junta
                            de Generales” to explain situa<pb n="129" facs="0169" xml:id="pg_129"
                            />tion today. There will probably be opposing point of view articulated.
                            But I would guess that military will not break with prevalent view that
                            politicians got country into mess and should get U.S. out of it, not
                            vice-versa.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_PZE_1">Edmundo Perez Zujovich</persName> , the
                            Frei intimate in charge of the stop-<persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> movement in the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> junta, informed his key party workers yesterday morning
                            that he was disengaging totally from their work. His pretext was that
                            they had used his name and/or had sought money from the U.S. Embassy and
                            that Frei and he were furious with their indiscretions with foreigners
                            and rightists. (I had asked <persName corresp="#p_PZE_1"
                                >Perez</persName> if he had sent these emissaries to the embassy and
                            had suggested he desist since they were so indiscreet and since we would
                            not have any dealings with them in any event.) This halt to the
                                stop-<persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> party movement
                            is widely known, but I am uncertain whether the <persName

                            into the accusation that we were offering money.</p>

                                >Allende</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>
                            leadership took place yesterday afternoon. Meeting publicly described as

                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> begged and received commitment
                            that <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> would not include in public
                            release certain <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> requests for
                            constitutional guarantees; <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> explained that <gloss target="#t_PCCh_1"
                                >PCCh</gloss> and hard-line Socialists upset with whole matter of
                            guarantees and wish to give only “clarifications.” <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> told <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> he would “have to massage” his allies and that he would

                            vote for him in Congress.</p>
                        <p>7. Frei told excellent source yesterday that he had to abandon
                            congressional formula because that “scoundrel <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>” had not only handed over <gloss

                                >Allende</persName> but had briefed <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> on every one of the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> congressmen; Frei said <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> now had more dirt and leverage than he
                            (Frei).</p>
                        <p>8. Excellent source (but without providing details) said he knew as
                            unassailable fact that Frei last night met with <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> in the home of <persName
                                corresp="#p_VSG_1">Gabriel Valdes</persName>. Source added personal
                            opinion that Frei was arranging his own exit from a situation he views
                            with increasing pessimism.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> will probably announce
                            his cabinet tomorrow. One Popular Unity bigwig (Alfonso Divid Lavon,
                            Secretary General of <gloss target="#t_API_1">API</gloss> Party) said
                            there would be three each Communists, Socialists and Radicals and two
                            each <gloss target="#t_API_1">API</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_MAPU_1"
                                >MAPU</gloss> and Social Democrat. Said Minister of Interior would
                            be Silva Simma, very respectable Radical and Mason and head of
                            Soviet-Chilean Friendship Society but Under Secretary would be
                            Communist. Added that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            first choice for Foreign Minister would be <persName corresp="#p_VSG_1"
                                >Valdes</persName> but did not know if latter would accept. A woman
                            Socialist would be in newly created Ministry of Family.</p>

                        <p>10. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] told me
                            last night after leaving late afternoon lengthy cabinet meeting that had
                            edited <persName corresp="#p_ZLA_1">Zaldivar</persName>’s report that
                            those such as himself who wished to stop <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> were not getting leadership from Frei. He knew
                            Frei was anti-<persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, but Frei
                            always found a reason for not taking decisive action. Frei did not like
                            any of the alternatives. Frei wished to be unblemished. Frei hoped the
                            Army would move but would give no order or specific encouragement. Frei
                            would not provoke a crisis by himself resigning or leaving the country.
                            Frei would probably seek to make the best of the worst by having <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> negotiate as much as it could from
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>.</p>
                        <p>11. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] the one
                            factor that could change the entire situation would be a faster downturn
                            in the economy. If that could be provoked, it would affect military
                            outlook and even <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>’s, particularly if
                            such downturn occurred before the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>
                            junta and reached maximum velocity before October 24th. He offered
                            following specific suggestions:</p>
                        <p>a. Get U.S. banks to cease renewing credits to Chile or Chilean
                            organizations and no new credits. (He said some U.S. banks still doing
                            business as usual.)</p>
                        <p>b. Get U.S. companies here to foot-drag to maximum possible. They could
                            without taking provocative action hold off on orders, on deliveries of
                            spare parts, on extending credits and so on. He recognized that British
                            doing the reverse at full speed with French and Italians not far behind.
                            But he said they count for relatively little. (FYI: General Tire Company
                            here, a big employer, is negotiating with <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>.)</p>
                        <p>c. Pass the word that at least some of the building and loan associations
                            are near bankruptcy [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>]. With a little push one of the biggest
                            (Calicanto) and one of the smallest (Sasa Chilena) would shut their
                            doors and start a real run.</p>
                        <p>d. Do the best possible to get a few businesses to close their doors in
                            the next three weeks.</p>
                        <p>e. Spread the word that rationing is probable. He quoted public
                            declaration of Communist controlled Confederation of Trade Unions
                                (<gloss target="#t_CUT_1">CUT</gloss>) stating that workers would
                            eat under <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> because they
                            would get “bonos” (stamps). Run on food stocks would be useful and would
                            increase demand for bank notes with Central Bank already in very short
                            supply of notes. He warned against any emphasis on inflation since that
                            would provoke run on durable goods and sop up public liquidity when
                            opposite goal is desired.</p>
                        <p>f. He said there would be considerable unemployment in Santiago by
                            mid-October since [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] private construction slump only partially sopped
                            by public works (perhaps ten of 55,000 expected unemployed in private
                            sector).</p>
                        <pb n="131" facs="0171" xml:id="pg_131"/>
                        <p>g. He noted that Alessandri’s own paper company had yesterday submitted
                            request for government approval of $9,000,000 (M) expansion [<hi
                                rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>]. He noted First National
                            City Bank intends to grant $2,500,000 of this as loan. (I told him that
                            Alessandri and his supporters increasingly furious with Frei and regard
                            the Rube Goldberg contraption as a Frei doublecross that has hurt
                            Alessandri’s prestige without having any real intent behind it. I added
                            that Socialists, with whom Alessandri had always had good relations were
                            also massaging the old man as well as seeking to entice rightists with
                            promises of managerial jobs.)</p>
                        <p>h. Try to have business downturn affect provinces since for the time
                            being only Santiago area really feeling pinch.</p>

                        <p>1. Minister of Defense <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1">Ossa</persName>
                            informed me last night of his and Frei’s actions to inform the military
                            of the true situation in Chile and of their conclusion that unless there
                            is a continuing worsening of the economic situation the election of
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is certain.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1">Ossa</persName> reported that talk
                            between Frei and <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName>,
                            after explaining why the country would inevitably be Communist, why the
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> could not be mustered into
                            opposition, why the armed forces would lose their U.S. military
                            connections, why Chile’s neighbors would seek to advantage themselves
                            from the weakened defense posture, and why Chile’s finances and business
                            are so affected, Frei noted <pb n="132" facs="0172" xml:id="pg_132"
                            />that <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName> had faithfully
                            carried out the constitutionalist doctrine that Frei and <persName
                                corresp="#p_OPS_1">Ossa</persName> had requested him to follow. In
                            response to <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName>’s
                            questions, Frei said he would not ask <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1"
                                >Schneider</persName> to change that doctrine because even though he
                            believed the military could block <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>, he would not request it since it would be a
                            form of cowardice on his part. He could not ask the military to do what
                            he himself would not do. He could not ask the military to do his work
                            for him.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1">Ossa</persName> said that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_PGC_1">Prats</persName> later reported
                                <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName> had repeated very
                            faithfully the Frei conversation to a junta of generals. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName> was also meeting yesterday
                            with the service chiefs of the army and air force. <persName
                                corresp="#p_OPS_1">Ossa</persName> said that the head of the
                            carabineros, General <persName corresp="#p_HCV_1">Huerta</persName>,
                            upon learning of these conversations had requested through <persName
                                corresp="#p_OPS_1">Ossa</persName> an immediate meeting with Frei
                            and it was being arranged.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1">Ossa</persName> said in pursuance to my
                            suggestions of last Sunday, he had also met separately with Navy <gloss
                                target="#t_CINC_1">CINC</gloss> Admiral <persName corresp="#p_PAF_1"

                            <persName corresp="#p_GVC_1">Guerraty</persName> and Army Chief of Staff
                            General <persName corresp="#p_PGC_1">Prats</persName>. To each he had
                            explained why there was no hope of a political solution, why the
                            military was the last resort and why they would not get so much as a nut
                            or bolt from the U.S. or have any other military connections with the
                            U.S. <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1">Ossa</persName> had told them he was
                            authorized by me to state this last point, explaining that the U.S. was
                            not taking any action against Chile per se but that the laws of the U.S.
                            had universal application in certain circumstances. The <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> program, if implemented, as
                                <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1">Ossa</persName> told them he thought
                            was certain, would signify the application of those laws.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1">Ossa</persName> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_GVC_1">Guerraty</persName> had not even questioned this
                            analysis since, as he said, he had been convinced of it from the start.
                            However, <persName corresp="#p_PAF_1">Porta</persName> was
                            thunder-struck by the citation of my name behind the “not even a nut or
                            bolt” judgment. When he remonstrated, <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1"
                                >Ossa</persName> told him it was only logical since the U.S. was not
                            intervening in the current crisis and had not intervened in the
                            elections to protect itself from its certain enemies.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_DAO_1">DAO</gloss> reports to me that the head of
                            Chilean marines informed him today that <persName corresp="#p_PAF_1"
                                >Porta</persName> went to see <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> yesterday to say he was extremely concerned by
                            the vulnerability of the Chilean navy to the U.S. cutoff and that he
                            wanted assurances that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            would not carry out policies that would provoke such a reaction.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> reportedly ducked an
                            answer and merely sought to placate <persName corresp="#p_PAF_1"
                                >Porta</persName> by telling him his government would maintain the
                            high levels of military arms and professionalism. I might repeat that
                                <persName corresp="#p_PAF_1">Porta</persName> with an English wife
                            and a profound admiration for the British is also influenced by what the
                            British ambassador is saying to him and to others. After all, the
                            leading British companies have taken full-page ads to announce their
                            confidence in what is clearly meant as endorsement for <persName

                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1">Ossa</persName> said that Frei yesterday
                            evening upon being advised of the interview that appeared yesterday
                            afternoon in Socialist <hi rend="italic">Ultima Hora</hi> (in which
                            Alessandri quoted as saying he recognizes <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>) telephoned to the old man. Alessandri cried he
                            had been betrayed and that he was “trying to get hold of her”—an
                            apparent reference to the anonymous interviewer. In any event the
                            incident gave Frei an opportunity to try to keep Alessandri in line and
                            I have taken other measures in that direction.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1">Ossa</persName> said Frei had also
                            stage-managed the removal of <persName corresp="#p_PZE_1"
                                >Perez-Zujovic</persName> from the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> parliamentary operation since the latter’s name had
                            been a red flag to so many key <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>ers,
                            particularly deputy and ex-Interior Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGB_1">Bernardo Leighton</persName>. Frei had been told
                            that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would go through
                            the masquerade of “negotiations” with the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> leadership over “conditions” and then announce them a
                            few days prior to the meeting of the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> Junta (October 3). <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1"
                                >Ossa</persName> added that the Frei forces had lost the fight to
                            delay the Junta until October 10th. Although Frei was very dispirited,
                                <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1">Ossa</persName> said the president was
                            aiding <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1">Ossa</persName> in his efforts to
                            gain at least 200 of the 500 <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>
                            delegates to the Junta in an anti-<persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"

                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_OPS_1">Ossa</persName> said unless the economic
                            situation worsened, the army surely would not move, the junta would not
                            respond to his massaging and the Congress October 24 would be a crushing
                            defeat for Frei’s forces. He urged that I do whatever I could to help
                            create the proper bearish climate. He also urged that we cut or hold in
                            suspense until after the inauguration all courses for the Chilean
                            military and if possible all military deliveries. I told him I had been
                            over-ruled by Washington on this matter.</p>
                        <p>10. Later that evening I met with <persName corresp="#p_LF_1">Flavian
                                Levine</persName>, the much respected (universally in Chile and the

                                target="#t_CAP_1">CAP</gloss>), the biggest by far Chilean
                            industrial enterprise, for which he has worked, indeed created with U.S.
                            private and EXIM support, for 25 years. <persName corresp="#p_LF_1"
                                >Levine</persName> is very trustworthy and his information is
                            interesting. (He supported Frei in 1964 and Alessandri would have
                            probably offered him the Ministry of Finance since he was an ardent
                            supporter and trusted intimate in the campaign.)</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_LF_1">Levine</persName> had seen <persName

                            earlier in the day. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> had
                            urged that he stay on as head of <gloss target="#t_CAP_1">CAP</gloss>
                            adding that his job was assured as long as he wished. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> said <persName
                                corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName> had given him three very
                            valuable advices that he would follow:</p>
                        <p>a. Persuade the technicians to stay in the country.</p>
                        <p>b. Keep copper in the dollar sales market. Do not count on other areas
                            for better conditions.</p>
                        <p>c. Do not act too revolutionary since you are a revolutionary and there
                            is no reason to prove too much to others what you know you are.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> had added that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName> had explained why it would
                            be better for him (Fidel) not to come to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s inauguration because of the impact it might
                            have abroad and had assured <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> he would come later when it was more convenient
                            to the Chilean.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> clearly indicated he
                            was considering very seriously offering the post of Foreign Minister in

                            Herrera</persName>, head of the Inter-American Development Bank who
                            promptly recognized <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> as
                            president 48 hours after the election and who will be here in early
                            October. <persName corresp="#p_LF_1">Levine</persName> said he was
                            certain <persName corresp="#p_HLF_1">Herrera</persName> would accept
                            some post in the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            government if he were not vetoed by Communists or hard line
                            Socialists.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Max Nolff</persName>, one of the five

                            on mining, told <persName corresp="#p_LF_1">Levine</persName> that both
                            U.S. iron and copper would be immediately nationalized. He asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_LF_1">Levine</persName> to have <gloss
                                target="#t_CAP_1">CAP</gloss> take over Bethlehem here per their
                            contract but <persName corresp="#p_LF_1">Levine</persName> explained to
                            me that Bethlehem’s contract only provides for the <gloss
                                target="#t_CAP_1">CAP</gloss> buyout in the event of Bethlehem’s
                            request. <persName corresp="#p_LF_1">Levine</persName> said that <gloss

                            had come to a halt because the Japanese had immediately cabled after the
                            elections to postpone until November any decision on their commitment to
                            sign a ten year purchase of ore contract and that without such a
                            contract the <gloss target="#t_EXIM_1">EX-IM</gloss> could not finance
                            the expansion. Japs had also expressed doubt if they could sign with
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. Moreover <gloss
                                target="#t_CAP_1">CAP</gloss> was out of cash, losing $8 millions
                            per month and that it was being kept afloat by the Central Bank which
                            would give it 50 million Escudos this month so as to meet obligations.
                            Sales had dropped by 30 per cent. U.S. banks had reduced supplier
                            credits from 12 to 10 millions. He would not be able to meet his
                            maturities in the U.S. in 90 days if the situation continued. He
                            accepted my advice not to go to the U.S. (to EXIM and others) next week
                            but to delay at least another week. I promised to cable EXIM.</p>

                        <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_LF_1">Levine</persName> said that he had

                                <persName corresp="#p_LF_1">Levine</persName> explained <persName
                                corresp="#p_VPP_1">Valdes</persName> had been officially on leave.
                            Moreover a year ago, he had called <persName corresp="#p_VPP_1"
                                >Valdes</persName> to warn that with the prospects of Alessandri’s
                            victory, if <persName corresp="#p_VPP_1">Valdes</persName> wished to
                            return to the firm, he had better make his intentions known in writing.
                            At that time <persName corresp="#p_VPP_1">Valdes</persName> scoffed at
                            the idea, stating it would be too much of a come-down to return.
                            Yesterday he told <persName corresp="#p_LF_1">Levine</persName> that
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> had approved the
                            idea and he wished to return. <persName corresp="#p_LF_1"
                                >Levine</persName> was non-committal since he said it would depend

                        <p>16. <persName corresp="#p_LF_1">Levine</persName> added that he could not

                            key men left since <gloss target="#t_CAP_1">CAP</gloss> was the most
                            complex single enterprise in Chile. He added that four of these key men
                            had definitely decided to leave by November 4th and some others might

                                <persName corresp="#p_LF_1">Levine</persName>, like <persName

                            normalcy quite quickly and the combination of defeatism and adaptability
                            that is taking hold will smooth <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s tasks.</p>
                        <p>18. All of which is to say that the economic lever (Anaconda et al) is
                            the last card; there are no others up my sleeve or anyone else’s. And if
                            that card is to be played, it must be done with maximum effect swiftly.
                            The Department cannot continue to consider carefully each decision so
                            that by the time it is taken it is completely out of tune with the
                            realities here. The Department could also make an art of what is a
                            natural function in Washington—the leakage of news without attribution.
                            What <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> technicians are being told by

                            in the world press promptly. Certainly Jack Anderson, the columnist,

                            including export insurance. He cannot understand why the Department has
                            taken no action whatsoever in Europe and he specifically mentioned Bonn,
                            Paris, London, Madrid, the low countries. He said that although Chile
                            was minor league compared to Mid-East and other problems, the steady
                            erosion of U.S. positions was having the most serious effect on our real

                            he was so distraught by the information from his own Foreign Ministry of
                            the complete silence of the Department that he urged me to organize the
                            assassination of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>.</p>
                        <p>20. I recognize that the Department regards me as “incorrigible” to use
                            the remarks echoed back here by recent visitors to our capital so I will
                            say it for the last time: If we want to stop <persName

                            and purposeful than the Department has been until now. If <pb n="136"

                            clear message on how to fulfill the Department’s long held goal of
                            getting along with <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>.</p>

                            THE PRELUDE TO A COMMUNIST VICTORY?</p>
                        <p>While the outlook for the survival of Chilean democracy does not seem
                            favorable, this paper examines a number of elements present in the

                            victory.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">ABSTRACT</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s likely accession to
                            the Chilean Presidency will pose serious problems for US interests both
                            in Chile and throughout the Hemisphere. However, these problems would be
                            vastly increased were the Communists to control the leftist coalition
                            that would govern Chile under these circumstances. Just what are the
                            chances that an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            Presidency will lead to a communist take-over?</p>
                        <p>While the outlook for the survival of Chilean democracy does not seem
                            favorable, there are a number of elements present in the situation that
                            do not point to an imminent or even inevitable Communist victory. In
                            particular, the rise of a Soviet-type regime in Chile under the
                            leadership of the Chilean Communist Party seems far-fetched, partly for
                            the following reasons: a) the checkered history of Communists in
                            coalitions in the post-World War II period, b) the long-standing
                            fractious relationship between Chilean Communists and Socialists, and c)
                            the erosion of Soviet authority in the Communist movement leading to
                            ambiguities concerning the nature of a Marxist-Leninist state.</p>
                        <p>Communists in coalitions in the post-World War II period were generally
                            unsuccessful in seizing power in the absence of direct Soviet <pb
                                n="137" facs="0177" xml:id="pg_137"/>military pressure and in cases
                            where they encountered massive internal political resistance. Hence
                            indigenous as well as environmental factors contributed to the fall of
                            Czechoslovakia in 1948 while imposing a policy of “hopeful waiting” on
                            the large Communist parties in France and Italy.</p>
                        <p>In this context, Chile’s experience in 1946–47 is not so different from
                            that of many Western European countries during the early post-World War
                            II period. For Chile too had its brief second fling at popular frontism
                            under President Videla before he ousted the Communists from office and
                            outlawed their party.</p>
                        <p>The question remains whether the Chilean Communists might not use the
                            currently more favorable situation in a quick move to seize power. This
                            eventuality cannot be excluded, but there are some indications that the
                            Communists themselves are not persuaded of the successful outcome of
                            such a venture in the light of their relatively small popular following
                            (15.7% of the vote in the 1969 parliamentary elections), their uncertain
                            control over their often more militant but also more undisciplined
                            Socialist coalition partners, and in the face of still sizeable and
                            distrustful opposition parties as well as a watchful military. In short,
                            Chilean Communists are likely to test the ground carefully before
                            embarking upon the next step in what for them can only be a gradual
                            ascent to power. In taking this stance the party reflects not only its
                            close identification with the Soviet line but also its aversion to any
                            adventurism. While this cautionary approach has brought Chilean
                            Communists into repeated conflicts with assorted Chilean leftists of
                            more extreme persuasion, it takes into account the Communist
                            leadership’s appreciation of the fact that the party’s physical distance
                            from the Soviet Union leaves its fortune and fate in the short run
                            pretty much in its own hands.</p>
                        <p>In consolidating a communist victory in Chile, the Chilean Communist
                            Party also will have to neutralize and eventually control its principal
                            coalition partner, the Chilean Socialists. This task may prove difficult
                            inasmuch as the ostensibly militant Marxist Socialists represent a
                            rather different brand of leftism that is really an amalgam of strident
                            nationalism and populism. As a jumble of the most disparate elements,
                            the Chilean Socialist Party has shown remarkable resilience in its 37
                            years of existence in spite of an unending series of splits and
                            reunifications. Furthermore, its currently more muted expressions of
                            resentment towards the Communists, largely an outgrowth of its electoral
                            alliance with them, should not obscure the fact that, ideologically
                            speaking, the Chilean Socialist Party has more in common with the
                            leaders of the Third World, who follow a policy of non-alignment and
                            anti-imperialism.</p>
                        <pb n="138" facs="0178" xml:id="pg_138"/>
                        <p>As eclectic and often erratic Marxists, the Chilean Socialists have in
                            turn welcomed Peronism, Titoism, <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel
                                Castro</persName>ism, and Maoism. Their choices of symbols and
                            currents have often been not only at odds with those of the Chilean
                            Communists but also shaped by an unending competition with the latter
                            for claiming the only truly left position in the Chilean political
                            spectrum. However, these ideological commitments have not prevented the
                            Socialists for many years from seeing merit in collaborating with
                            communists for practical political purposes. This underlies their
                            present collaboration with the Chilean Communist Party when, beginning
                            in 1952, their then still violently anti-Communist leader <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> became a leading exponent of
                            collaboration.</p>
                        <p>While this collaboration has now lasted over 15 years to the mutual
                            benefit of both parties, it has not served to diminish Socialist
                            distrust of and hostility towards their Communist coalition partners.
                            Nevertheless, Socialists share with Communists a deep hostility against
                            the “Colossus from the North”. If anything, the Socialist opposition to
                            “Yankee imperialism” is more vehement because it is the product of an
                            extreme nationalistic resentment of the US role in Chile which, in their
                            estimation, constitutes the principal obstacle to social change.</p>
                        <p>In discussing whether Chile, under <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>, will become a Marxist-Leninist state, it is
                            important to note that there is no textbook definition for such a state.
                            The extent to which states, professing to adhere to Marxism-Leninism,
                            follow Soviet practice is due more to complex reasons of power politics,
                            historical circumstances, and a host of other unique factors than to
                            doctrinal necessity. In fact, the multipolar character of contemporary
                            communism has given rise to states like China, Yugoslavia, Cuba, and the
                            short-lived experiment in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968,
                            all of which were self-declared adherents of Marxism-Leninism, yet have
                            come to differ in their interpretation of doctrine from the Soviets and
                            are no longer willing to subordinate their interests to those of the
                            Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The belief systems of communists and socialists alone cannot determine
                            whether a Chilean-style constellation, professing to adhere to the
                            principles of Marxism-Leninism, can be transformed into a one-party
                            dictatorship of either the Soviet type, or, more usual for Latin
                            America, into an authoritarian nationalist-populist regime. Domestic
                            factors, external influence, and the perception of these elements by key
                            actors involved in the struggle for power will govern the speed at which
                            any putative communist take-over is likely to take place. All one can
                            suggest here is that communists have had clear sailing only when the
                            opposition was under direct Soviet pressure.</p>
                        <p>In the last analysis, prospects for the continuation of a competitive
                            political system in Chile, in the event <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> takes over, are likely to <pb n="139"
                                facs="0179" xml:id="pg_139"/>be determined more by practical
                            circumstances than by the ideological preconceptions of either
                            Communists or Socialists. As for the Communists, they are likely to be
                            cautious for doctrinal as well as for practical reasons. The more
                            visceral Socialists have a more ambivalent attitude towards the system
                            which makes them bombastic revolutionary rhetoricians on the one hand
                            and opportunistic participants in it on the other.</p>
                        <p>Whether socialist bombast is now likely to engender just enough tinder to
                            spark a coup, or will be tempered by more pragmatic considerations is
                            hard to predict. At any rate, the fluidity of the situation and the
                            uneasy relationship between the two principal leftist alliance partners
                            are factors militating against a communist take-over in Chile.</p>

                        <p>An authoritarian Marxist government in Chile will have adverse
                            implications for US security interests in Latin America. These
                            implications may be divided into two interrelated groupings: (1)
                            politico-military factors that could affect the position of the United
                            States within the Latin American region and as a world power; and (2)
                            the exclusion of US military activities from Chile, and the military
                            activities which might be carried out by Chile, or its Communist allies
                            in Chile. This <pb n="140" facs="0180" xml:id="pg_140"/>memorandum

                        <p>The following are implications for US security interests resulting from

                        <p>The major politico-military implications of a Marxist government in Chile
                            are:</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>United States security is tied to Latin America in a series of
                            multilateral and bilateral security agreements of varying specificity
                            which make up the inter-American security system. Although it may be
                            argued that these security bonds are not meaningful in today’s context,
                            they nonetheless provide the essential and often useful framework of US
                            political and security policy in Latin America. This is of special
                            importance in terms of the US status within the world arena. Most
                            countries of the world consider Latin America in general (less Cuba) as
                            something of a special preserve of the US. In the East-West confronta<pb
                                n="141" facs="0181" xml:id="pg_141"/>tion, Latin America has been a
                            sphere of US influence. Should this area turn overtly hostile, US
                            prestige and influence in the world at large would suffer, affecting US
                            security as well as political interests.</p>
                        <p>The two major planks of this framework are the Rio Pact (Inter-American
                            Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance) and the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1"
                                >OAS</gloss>. The Rio Pact, designed for hemispheric security, is
                            specific in its provision that “an armed attack by any State against an
                            American State shall be considered an attack against all the American
                            States,” although the nature of the response is left to the individual
                            State. The <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> can provide important
                            politico-military support to United States actions to counter direct
                            threats from outside the hemisphere, as in the Cuban Missile Crisis of
                            1962. It also plays a useful role in intra-hemispheric disputes,
                            although its effectiveness is sharply limited by a general reluctance
                            among member states to grant “interventionist” powers. Of lesser
                            practical importance is the Inter-American Defense Board (<gloss
                                target="#t_IADB_1">IADB</gloss>), which because of its lack of an
                            organizational tie to the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> has no
                            meaningful outlet for its product. It is, however, useful as a device
                            for exchanging and promoting ideas among the inter-American
                            military.</p>
                        <p>It is against this structure that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s efforts would early be directed. He has
                            publicly proclaimed that his government would denounce “all treaties or
                            agreements . . . which limit the sovereignty of Chile. . . .” The
                            platform of Popular Unity (<persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s coalition) calls for Chile to “denounce” the
                                <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> and seek a “truly
                            representative” organization. This raises the possibility of eventual
                            Chilean withdrawal from the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> or of
                            such violent efforts to “restructure” it that it would no longer be
                            viable. Under such circumstances, the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1"
                                >OAS</gloss> could find itself in a crisis; some governments would
                            be influenced to follow the Chilean efforts to weaken the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> and to work through some exclusively
                            Latin American organization. While <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s references to the Rio Pact have not been as
                            specific, his ultimate goals in this regard are expected to be the same
                            as for the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>. In the case of the
                                <gloss target="#t_IADB_1">IADB</gloss>, the Cuban experience is
                            instructive. It was necessary for the Board to vote to exclude Cuba from
                            its classified transactions in April 1961, as prejudicial to the mission
                            of the Board. In any event, the significance of an <persName

                            the longstanding formal framework for inter-American security
                            cooperation would be enhanced by its occurrence at a time when these
                            traditional security arrangements are growing less satisfying to Latin
                            America.</p>

                        <p>Another threat to US security interests of major importance that would be
                            increased by a Marxist government in Chile is the growing nationalism in
                            Latin America, a nationalism which frequently has anti-US overtones.
                            Radical attitudes or movements are gaining ground <pb n="142"
                                facs="0182" xml:id="pg_142"/>within the establishment of Latin
                            American political life, including the military. There is a considerable
                            sector of radical thought, both on the left and right, that gains
                            strength from the continued inability of Latin America to achieve parity
                            and prosperity in the modern world; both wings are articulate sources of
                            a steady stream of anti-Americanism. This is nothing new. What is new is
                            the threat they will present to US interests when taken in conjunction
                            with a Soviet presence and a Soviet willingness to offer itself, if only
                            partially, as an alternative to Latin dependence on the US. <persName

                            would turn increasingly toward the Soviets. This would inspire leftist
                            elements throughout the hemisphere, and the result would be a
                            significant increase in pressure on the region’s more moderate
                            governments, with an inevitably adverse effect on US interests.</p>

                        <p>There are indications of the formation of a Chile-Cuba “axis” in
                            hemispheric affairs. Although the military effect of such coordination
                            would be slight, the support of <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel

                            could serve to undermine the major aspect of US Cuban policy: the
                            isolation of Cuba from the political and economic activity of the
                            hemisphere. Significant erosion of this policy would embolden <persName

                        </p>
                        <p>At present, despite the existence of rural insurgency in a few countries,
                            and of considerable urban agitation in most countries, neither guerrilla
                            movements nor urban terrorism pose serious threats to the immediate
                            future of any national government. This results not only from the
                            capability of the various countries to contain the insurgency threat at
                            its present level, but also from the factionalism and weakness of the
                            ideological motivations of the Latin American radical movements. The
                            relatively weak subversive organizations have been unable to make much
                            headway against the great apathy and inertia of Latin American society,
                            particularly in the rural areas. Should the disparate Communist factions
                            ever join forces, however, the insurgency problem could reach major
                            proportions with a grave danger to US interests.</p>
                        <p>A Communist base in Chile from which “revolution” could be exported could
                            well provide the focal point for unifying these disparate Communist
                            factions. Initially, an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            government might not go overtly beyond the Popular Unity’s platform
                            expression of “solidarity” with the “liberation” struggles and with
                            attempts to build socialism. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> and the Communists are aware of the risks of

                            opinion should Chilean support for insurgencies in other countries
                            become too blatantly obvious. On the other hand, there is evidence that
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and his Communist
                            supporters (both Chilean and international) will move rapidly and
                            ruthlessly to consolidate their advantages. This hard line tendency will
                            be encouraged by their conviction of US acceptance of events in Chile.
                            Whatever the initial public actions of his government, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s talk of a Cuba-Chile “axis”
                            from which to “launch” revolution foreshadows Chile’s becoming a haven
                            and a training ground, with Soviet assistance, for “revolutionaries.”
                            Individual Chileans have already been found in Bolivia’s main guerrilla
                            group. With a strong continental base, adequate financing, common
                            ideological motivation and a prestigious “people’s democracy” as the
                            model, the insurgency movement in South America, over the long range,
                            would take on a more respectable mantle of a bona fide political
                            “revolutionary” movement as is the present case in Chile. By fanning and
                            exploiting the growing Latin American sentiment for reducing the
                            hemisphere’s dependence on the US, the Communists would probably seek to
                            gain power through popular coalitions pledged to extirpate US influence

                            its dependence on the US, the Soviets would probably offer to equip all
                            or part of the Chilean armed forces with modern weapon systems at a
                            supportable cost. The primary purpose of such a move would be to set up
                            a model which others might wish to imitate. The Soviets followed the
                            same pattern in the Middle East with much success and while the
                            circumstances are different, the desires of the military in both areas
                            are the same—modern and effective armed forces.</p>
                        <p>Because of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s expected
                            policy of dealing cautiously with the Chilean military, at least in the
                            early stages, a decision to seek Soviet military assistance may be
                            delayed, especially if modern and significant Western equipment were
                            also available. Eventually, however, it can be expected that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s “solidarity” with the
                            socialist countries will result in reliance on Communist military
                            equipment. And herein lies a potential for a serious erosion of US
                            military influence in the region.</p>
                        <p>While the long tradition of using Western warships, aircraft, tanks,
                            artillery, and other equipment among the various Latin American <pb
                                n="144" facs="0184" xml:id="pg_144"/>armed forces would have some
                            weight, a tempting offer of more modern and comprehensive Communist
                            equipment as replacements would probably be impossible to resist. This
                            would be particularly true if the political climate evolved over time in
                            a manner that made less objectionable an involvement with a “socialist”
                            nation. To the extent that such a Soviet military assistance program
                            would succeed, and some success could be expected, US military influence
                            and access would be proportionately reduced in Latin America.</p>

                            aid, and other pacts which Chile has signed with the United States.”
                            While <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> may be cautious,
                            in deference to his own military, in fulfilling the pledge, there seems
                            little doubt that the current US military presence in Chile will
                            eventually be ordered withdrawn:</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> could permit the MILGP,
                            in some form, to remain during the early period of his Administration as

                            position in the Presidency is consolidated. It is likely that activities
                            in other sectors of US-Chilean relations (e.g., nationalization of US
                            investments) may bring into play US laws that will so exacerbate our
                            relationships with the Chilean military as to force withdrawal of the

                            easy way for the Marxists to overcome Chilean military objections to
                            severing military ties with the US would be the acceptance of
                            large-scale dramatic Soviet military assistance. The Soviet capability

                            interests have been amply demonstrated in many places, most recently in

                            misunderstanding in Chile over visas for these personnel during
                            September 1970. Chilean unwillingness to cooperate would complicate
                            support of these operations and would require alternative solutions. The

                            the peacetime activities described in the preceding paragraphs would be
                            the impact of a hostile or uncooperative Chile in the event of major
                            hostilities with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Major US
                            naval vessels (all the larger aircraft carriers) and many commercial
                            vessels are now too large to use the Panama Canal and must use the
                            passages controlled by or adjacent to Chile for inter-oceanic transit.
                            The US has been able to depend on the use of Chilean facilities as
                            necessary, and on the probable cooperation of the efficient Chilean
                            Navy, in major hostilities. If the required facilities would have to be
                            seized and defended from a hostile Chile, probably deleterious effects
                            on cooperation by other Latin nations, and a certain diversion of US
                            military forces, would result. This implication is discussed in more

                            from a Soviet ground or air force presence in Chile appears rather
                            remote because of the great distance between Chile and the US, and the
                            Soviet capability to launch such attacks from its existing bases. The
                            presence of Soviet tactical ground and air forces in Chile would deter
                            possible intervention by other Latin powers such as Brazil and
                            Argentina, would present a military threat to other continental <gloss
                                target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> members, and would increase the
                            difficulty of the US seizure of required Chilean facilities in the event
                            of US-<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> hostilities.</p>
                        <p>An expanding Soviet naval presence in Chile, on the other hand, could
                            pose an eventual threat to US security of real significance. Despite the
                            general ability of the US to supply its strategic materials from
                            alternate sources in time of war, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> would probably attempt to interfere with Latin
                            American trade routes. Since it is not likely that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would, at present force levels,
                            deploy large numbers of nuclear <pb n="146" facs="0186" xml:id="pg_146"
                            />submarines from more decisive areas of confrontation to Latin American
                            waters, the use of Chilean support bases would greatly increase the
                            effectiveness of the more numerous conventional submarines. For either
                            type submarine, the availability of bases in Chile would provide
                            significant deployment and support advantages. US naval movement between
                            the Atlantic and Pacific oceans would be jeopardized by the Soviet
                            ability to interdict the passages around the Horn. Also, in a conflict
                            where the Soviets undertook an anti-shipping campaign, it is not likely
                            that the Panama Canal would escape attack.</p>
                        <p>To defend against this potential threat, the US would have to eliminate
                            the Soviet forces in Chile, divert <gloss target="#t_ASW_1">ASW</gloss>
                            forces to Latin American waters, or build up friendly Latin American
                            navies to the point where the threat could be contained. The Latin
                            American navies now have virtually no capability against a sophisticated
                            submarine threat, and construction of an adequate <gloss
                                target="#t_ASW_1">ASW</gloss> force is beyond their present
                            resources. If the US were to underwrite the substantial costs involved
                            in developing such a capability, there could be no real assurance that
                            those forces would be available when the US felt they were needed.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusions.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the security problems created by a Marxist Chile would be
                            extremely difficult to manage and would pose a serious threat to US
                            interests not only in Chile, but eventually throughout South America.
                            The conjunction of a major Marxist state, rising radical nationalism,
                            and a Soviet willingness and ability to offer itself as an alternative
                            to South American dependence on the US gives the threat major new
                            proportions. Although the US has paid lip-service to its security
                            interests in South America in the past, it has never accorded those
                            interests a significant priority of effort. In the face of the present
                            and developing threat and the potential future significance of South
                            America, it is necessary that we re-examine this priority and its
                            consequent policies. While it is difficult to judge exactly what role
                            South America will play in the future security balance, by the year 2000
                            the population of Latin America is expected to reach a total of 700
                            million. If the scientific and economic growth of the region even
                            approaches the population growth, the major countries of South America
                            could be important to the US as free world leaders—or as major
                            antagonists.</p>

                        <p>4512. Subj: <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and the
                            US.</p>
                        <p>1. Since returning from Washington consultations, there have been a
                            number of significant developments and emerging trends here that have an
                            important bearing on our immediate and longer-term policies and
                            postures.</p>
                        <p>2. Insofar as the immediate is concerned:</p>
                        <p>A. It is evident that the anticipated Latin American reaction to
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s election is that
                            Chile continues to be a democratic friendly state until events prove the
                            contrary. Delegations to the inauguration will be cabinet level;
                            congratulatory messages will be sent promptly by most heads of state;
                            Ambassadors will make calls on <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> this week. It is interesting to note that the
                            first diplomat to call on the President elect within minutes of the
                            congressional vote Oct 24th was the Colombian who then told a nationwide
                            TV and radio audience in gushing terms of his friendship and admiration
                            for <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>.</p>
                        <p>B. The Western Europeans will send minimal delegations of one or two
                            persons, rounded out by their representation in Santiago. Most will not
                            rpt not send congratulatory messages until inauguration. Some (French
                            already and German soon) will call on <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>; others (British) will today write
                            congratulatory personal letters. Several will announce shortly new loans
                            (Germans for $1.5 million for third phase of Puerto Montt port
                            development, British for 4 million sterling and French recently
                            announced automotive expansion plans of several millions).</p>
                        <p>C. Romanians and Yugoslavs taking lead among Eastern Europeans. Although
                            Soviet President sent congratulatory message, my impression is that
                            Moscow will keep to low-key pitch for the moment.</p>
                        <p>D. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> responded as promptly
                            as Frei to my warning (Santiago 4468) re inflammatory nature of his
                            followers charges against US (<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and
                            Pentagon) involvement in <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1"
                                >Schneider</persName> assassination and in coup plotting. In his
                            first press conference, he assiduously avoided any <pb n="148"
                                facs="0188" xml:id="pg_148"/>mention of foreign elements re
                                <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName> and he went
                            further by stating Chilean monopolists were the key domestic problem,
                            not foreign companies. (Gen <persName corresp="#p_VGC_1"
                                >Valenzuela</persName> had put Communist papers on notice 48 hours
                            earlier in response my warning as MinState <persName corresp="#p_TCR_1"
                                >Troncoso</persName> called to tell me yesterday and to say
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would also take
                            similar action.)</p>
                        <p>3. As for longer-term:</p>
                        <p>A. Western Europeans are unanimous in their view that while Communists
                            intend to move slowly and cautiously in attempting to attain control of
                            Chile <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> should not rpt not
                            be written off. Even German Amb has reversed his line. He now says that
                            while state control system is inevitably doomed to failure, West should
                            avoid any overt hostility that speeds radicalization of society and
                            makes US or West scapegoat for it. He goes farther by suggesting it is
                            possible to divide <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> from
                            Communists. British has retreated in interim so that his view is same as
                            Germans; Italian has also lost some of his innocence and more or less in
                            tune with German.</p>
                        <p>B. Soviets have changed too in that they are playing down the possibility
                            of Soviet meaningful trade and aid to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>. Instead they are urging he maintain best
                            possible rels with West.</p>
                        <p>C. US companies are in the majority busily involved in pre-negotiation
                            talks with <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> reps. While
                            they have no illusions about long-term prospects, they are without
                            exception interested in getting the best possible deal for their
                            stock-holders. They (as I) are convinced <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> will, barring US provocation, meet his
                            international debts, will pay acceptable compensation in acceptable
                            form, will seek continued US and Western investment, will want for at
                            least year or two significant US management.</p>
                        <p>D. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is giving very serious
                            reconsideration to his electoral declarations re prompt recognition of
                            all still unrecognized “socialist” states. It is likely, unless he were
                            to become convinced that the West was implacably hostile, that he will
                            go slow. (There are some indications that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> is already convinced the US will be unalterably
                            “hostile”.)</p>
                        <p>4. I remain as convinced as ever that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> has not changed skins—that he is an
                            unreconstructed socialist with an anti-US, anti-capitalist bias whose
                            long-term goal is a state controlled economy of no significant
                            difference than that which the Communists want and that which will
                            involuntarily help Communist domination. What has occurred is that the
                            realities of the Chilean economy and the hard facts of Chilean
                            dependence on Western (largely US) capital, markets and technology, are
                            seen quite differently from the Presidential chair than from a
                            candidate’s platform.</p>
                        <p>5. I am persuaded as ever too that the tensions within his governing
                            coalition have been exacerbated by the deteriorating economic <pb
                                n="149" facs="0189" xml:id="pg_149"/>situation and the constraints
                            it places on <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s tactical
                            options. These tensions can be made more abrasive and they, in turn,
                            will give the opposition, if Frei chooses to play that role openly as I
                            anticipate he will do, an opportunity to exploit the situation to a
                            greater degree than expected on election night. While the Communists are
                            going forward with all their plans to consolidate their hold over the
                            workers, they have been forced to retreat on plans for the fast
                            take-over of the media; they can be compelled to slow the execution of
                            some of their other essential goals.</p>
                        <p>6. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> in his recent
                            briefing of New England editors said in another context: “We
                            deliberately kept our options open . . . to do enough to discourage
                            irresponsibility but not so much as to give the sense of irreversibility
                            to what was going on, to restrain outside forces that had already
                            intervened, but not to a point where we were triggering a whole set of
                            other outside forces when it wasn’t necessary.”</p>
                        <p>7. I think this prescription should apply to the Chilean case. There is
                            no point in triggering reactions that are unnecessary or provoke outside
                            forces, be they friendly, as in the case of <gloss target="#t_OAS_1"
                                >OAS</gloss> and Latin America, or unfriendly. I believe that the
                            economic situation will have considerable influence on events in the
                            next year and that we can keep our options open there. But in order to
                            have such options our public posture must be above hostility. Therefore
                            I specifically recommend:</p>
                        <p>A. The President send a message of good wishes to <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> on inauguration, the terms of
                            which might be based on our knowledge of others (including Bonn’s,
                            London’s or Rome’s).</p>
                        <p>B. The Dept Spokesman state at an early opportunity that the US looks
                            forward to normal relations and a continuation of the traditional ties
                            with Chile.</p>

                            <p>1. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government
                                will seek to establish in Chile as soon as feasible an authoritarian
                                system following Marxist principles. To</p>

                            <p>that end it will move (a) to bring all significant economic activity
                                under state operation including nationalization of basic industries;
                                (b) to gain control over the security and armed forces; and (c) to
                                dominate public information media. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> is a Marxist, and will be faithful to his
                                Marxist goals, but in his tactics may be a pragmatist who, for as
                                long as it suits his purposes, might tolerate less than radical
                                solutions. The well-organized Communist Party of Chile with its new
                                legitimacy will be in a key position to influence the direction of
                                an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government.</p>
                            <p>2. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government
                                will, at least in its first two years, encounter some political
                                opposition from anti-Communist forces including the military, and
                                will suffer from internal tensions, especially between Socialists
                                and orthodox Communists, as well as between opportunists and
                                ideologues within the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>. It will
                                work deliberately but purposefully to eliminate that opposition and
                                those tensions. Opposition within the military will act as both an
                                incentive and a deterrent to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName>’s attempting to establish absolute control
                                over the military and security forces through key appointments,
                                retirements, and other legal measures. The pace at which <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> will proceed to obtain
                                this control will be dictated by opportunity and circumstances, but
                                assuredly will be as rapid as possible without inciting a dangerous
                                reaction from the military.</p>
                            <p>3. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government
                                will encounter serious economic problems which could exacerbate
                                tensions within the governing coalition and increase the potential
                                of anti-government forces. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> government will confront these problems
                                cautiously but with determination and without changing its ultimate
                                goal.</p>
                            <p>4. An early test of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                                acceptance will be the nation-wide municipal elections scheduled for
                                April 1971. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> will use
                                this occasion to seek to consolidate his power.</p>
                            <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Regarding Chile’s External Posture</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>1. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government
                                will, despite possibly reassuring gestures, have a profound
                                anti-American bias and will work to extirpate U.S. influence from
                                the country and in order to do so may find it useful politically at
                                some time to confront the United States. The <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government may be expected
                                to work against U.S. interests in the hemisphere and the rest of the
                                world.</p>
                            <p>2. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government
                                will remain in the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>, but will
                                seek to use it as a forum for advancing its interests principally at
                                the expense of the United States.</p>
                            <p>3. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government
                                will seek to maintain normal relations with the other Latin American
                                governments and to influence other countries of Latin America to
                                emulate the Chilean example. At the <pb n="152" facs="0192"
                                    xml:id="pg_152"/>same time, Chile will probably become a haven
                                for Latin American subversives and a staging ground for subversive
                                movements in other countries despite <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName>’s desire to maintain normal relations within
                                the hemisphere. The Chilean Communist Party will exploit its
                                new-found respectability to strengthen its ties and influence with
                                its collaborators in the hemisphere.</p>
                            <p>4. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government
                                will establish diplomatic relations and resume full trading ties
                                with Cuba, although it may proceed cautiously to these ends.</p>
                            <p>5. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government
                                will most likely eventually carry out its expressed intention to
                                recognize and establish diplomatic relations with all other
                                “Socialist” countries including North Vietnam, Communist China,
                                North Korea, and East Germany.</p>
                            <p>6. A Marxist-<persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                                government in power would represent a potential danger to Western
                                Hemisphere security, to the extent that it develops military ties
                                with Communist powers, and is actively hostile to inter-American
                                security organizations. Full realization of these potentials could
                                threaten U.S. security interests specifically.</p>
                            <p>7. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government
                                will have close relations with the Soviet Union but will seek to
                                avoid dependence on it.</p>
                            <p>8. At least at the outset, the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> government will wish to maintain its
                                international credibility as a responsible debtor, as a trusted
                                borrower, and as a sovereign nation that fulfills its international
                                obligations independent of any great power. It is unlikely, however,
                                that it can complete its announced program of nationalization with
                                “fair compensation” to U.S. investors.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>The U.S. Congress and knowledgeable sectors of the public will follow
                                with interest the political course which Chile takes internally and
                                its attitudes and actions with regard to the United States. The
                                realism, finesse and effectiveness of the U.S. posture toward Chile
                                will receive equivalent interest.</p>
                            <p>To date, coast to coast editorial comment has generally supported the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> administration’s
                                handling of developments in Chile. As the actions of the <persName

                                overtly hostile to U.S. interests, however, we may expect adverse
                                reaction by some sectors of the U.S. public, press, and Congress to
                                the “establishment of another communist government in the
                                hemisphere,” with consequent pressures on U.S. policy.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s assumption of
                                power will provoke little overt hostility, at least initially, from
                                Latin American or Western European gov<pb n="153" facs="0193"

                                accept it in regional and multilateral organizations. To date, the
                                results of our consultations with the other American Republics
                                indicate concern on their part over developments in Chile but
                                general endorsement of adopting a “wait and see” attitude on their
                                and our parts. There will, however, be substantial official but
                                privately expressed mistrust of and hostility toward the policies of
                                that government as they develop along their expected lines.</p>

                            <p>The United States should maintain a restrained, deliberate attitude
                                toward Chile. In this manner we would maintain and exercise our

                            reporting the formation in Santiago of a committee of support for the

                                target="#t_ELN_1">ELN</gloss>). The articles stated that the group,

                            express solidarity with the Bolivian revolutionaries. Other Socialist
                            leaders were named officers of the committee. “Granma,” of 14 January
                            1970, stated that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would

                            clandestine support for Latin American revolutionary organizations as
                            reported herein differ from his overt public statements, which pledge a

                            constitution” and “unreserved respect for the people’s right to

                            did not specify the time frame during which he intends to undertake this
                            activity, but he will doubtless gauge this very carefully in view of the
                            relatively moderate public image he is attempting to project towards

                            countries. He cautioned that the Chilean Government will have to protect
                            its international reputation and, therefore, will have to provide this
                            support in a clandestine fashion to avoid becoming isolated and

                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government, at least in the
                            early stages of its existence. A Soviet diplomat in Santiago reportedly
                            cautioned that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> should
                            delay recognizing <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName>
                            until he can do so in concert with other Latin American countries,
                            perhaps Peru and Bolivia, thereby avoiding unnecessary early
                            difficulties for the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> administration.
                            There are indications that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            does not want Chile to become dependent on trade with communist
                            countries. Six months prior to the Chilean election two Soviet diplomats
                            in Santiago reportedly said the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            could not logistically support an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> government, and expressed the view that the
                            policies of such a government would be completely different from those
                            of Havana.</p>
                        <p>Heavily committed to Cuba, as well as to Arab and Indochinese clients,
                            and possibly constrained by its own domestic economic problems, the

                            Marxist experimentation in Chile. Moreover, Moscow seems to have
                            concluded that it is still too early to predict the potential for
                            success or failure of the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> program or
                            of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s ability to survive.
                            In these circumstances, Moscow apparently is advising the Chilean
                            Communist Party to urge a gradualist <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>
                            approach, at least during the early months of the new administration.
                            Specifically, the Soviets appear anxious that Washington not be unduly
                            provoked by the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            government as Chile begins the “transformation” process.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">But Can Moscow Stay Out for Long?</hi> It will be some
                            time before any pattern develops in Chile’s new relationships with
                            communist countries; therefore current speculation on their nature must
                            be tentative. If, in implementing his program, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> runs into serious economic
                            difficulties and the West in his view is unresponsive, Moscow may
                            receive appeals from the Chilean Government for substantial economic
                            support. Much as Moscow might prefer to see “Marxism” installed in Chile
                            without a heavy increment of Soviet material assistance, it alone of the
                            world’s communist powers (with the barely possible exception of China)
                            has the potential to render such aid. While the circumstances under
                            which Chile might request substantial Soviet assistance are
                            unpredictable, Moscow might find it very difficult to refuse Chilean
                            overtures given its commitment to advancing world “socialism.”</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government will
                            seek to establish in Chile as soon as feasible an authoritarian system
                            following Marxist principles. To that end it will move (a) to bring all
                            significant economic activity under state operation including
                            nationalization of basic industries; (b) to gain control over the
                            security and armed forces; and (c) to dominate public information media.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is a Marxist, and
                            will be faithful to his Marxist goals, but in his tactics may be a
                            pragmatist who, for as long as it suits his purposes, might tolerate
                            less than radical solutions. The well-organized Communist Party of Chile
                            with its new legitimacy will be in a key position to influence the
                            direction of an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            government.</p>
                        <p>2. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government will,
                            at least in its first two years, encounter some political opposition
                            from anti-Communist forces including the military, and will suffer from
                            internal tensions, especially between Socialists and orthodox
                            Communists, as well as between opportunists and ideologues within the
                                <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>. It will work deliberately but
                            purposefully to eliminate that opposition and those tensions. Opposition
                            within the military will act as both an incentive and a deterrent to
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s attempting to
                            establish absolute control over the military and security forces through
                            key appointments, retirements, and other legal measures. The pace at
                            which <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> will proceed to
                            obtain this control will be dictated by opportunity and circumstances,
                            but assuredly will be as rapid as possible without inciting a dangerous
                            reaction from the military.</p>
                        <pb n="164" facs="0204" xml:id="pg_164"/>
                        <p>3. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government will
                            encounter serious economic problems which could exacerbate tensions
                            within the governing coalition and increase the potential of
                            anti-government forces. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> government will confront these problems
                            cautiously but with determination and without changing its ultimate
                            goal.</p>
                        <p>4. An early test of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            acceptance will be the nation-wide municipal elections scheduled for
                            April 1971. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> will use
                            this occasion to seek to consolidate his power.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Regarding Chile’s External Posture</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government will,
                            despite possibly reassuring gestures, have a profound anti-American bias
                            and will work to extirpate U.S. influence from the country and in order
                            to do so may find it useful politically at some time to confront the
                            United States. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            government may be expected to work against U.S. interests in the
                            hemisphere and the rest of the world.</p>
                        <p>2. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government will
                            remain in the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>, but will seek to use
                            it as a forum for advancing its interests principally at the expense of
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>3. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government will
                            seek to maintain normal relations with the other Latin American
                            governments and to influence other countries of Latin America to emulate
                            the Chilean example. At the same time, Chile will probably become a
                            haven for Latin American subversives and a staging ground for subversive
                            movements in other countries despite <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s desire to maintain normal relations within the
                            hemisphere. The Chilean Communist Party will exploit its new-found
                            respectability to strengthen its ties and influence with its
                            collaborators in the hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>4. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government will
                            establish diplomatic relations and resume full trading ties with Cuba,
                            although it may proceed cautiously to these ends.</p>
                        <p>5. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government will
                            most likely eventually carry out its expressed intention to recognize
                            and establish diplomatic relations with all other “Socialist” countries
                            including North Vietnam, Communist China, North Korea, and East
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>6. A Marxist-<persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government
                            in power would represent a potential danger to Western Hemisphere
                            security, to the extent that it develops military ties with Communist
                            powers, and is actively hostile to inter-American security
                            organizations. Full realization of these potentials could threaten U.S.
                            security interests specifically.</p>
                        <p>7. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government will
                            have close relations with the Soviet Union but will seek to avoid
                            dependence on it.</p>
                        <p>8. At least at the outset, the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> government will wish to maintain its
                            international credibility as a responsible debtor, as a trusted <pb
                                n="165" facs="0205" xml:id="pg_165"/>borrower, and as a sovereign
                            nation that fulfills its international obligations independent of any
                            great power. It is unlikely, however, that it can complete its announced
                            program of nationalization with “fair compensation” to U.S.
                            investors.</p>
                        <p>C. <hi rend="italic">Regarding Attitudes in the United States</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The U.S. Congress and knowledgeable sectors of the public will follow
                            with interest the political course which Chile takes internally and its
                            attitudes and actions with regard to the United States. The realism,
                            finesse and effectiveness of the U.S. posture toward Chile will receive
                            equivalent interest.</p>
                        <p>To date, coast to coast editorial comment has generally supported the
                            manner in which the United States has handled developments in Chile. As
                            the actions of the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            government become more overtly hostile to U.S. interests, however, we
                            may expect adverse reaction by some sectors of the U.S. public, press,
                            and Congress to the “establishment of another communist government in
                            the hemisphere,” with consequent pressures on U.S. policy.</p>
                        <p>D. <hi rend="italic">Regarding Attitudes of Other Countries</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s assumption of power
                            will provoke little overt hostility, at least initially, from Latin
                            American or Western European governments, and these governments will
                            publicly accept it in regional and multilateral organizations. To date,
                            the results of our consultations with the other American Republics
                            indicate concern on their part over developments in Chile but general
                            endorsement of adopting a “wait and see” attitude on their and our
                            parts. There will, however, be substantial official but privately
                            expressed mistrust of and hostility toward the policies of that
                            government as they develop along their expected lines.</p>

                            the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government of an
                            authoritarian Marxist regime, prevention of the regime’s falling under
                            Communist control, and prevention of its influencing the rest of Latin
                            America to follow it either as a model or through its external policies;
                            (2) to act as a counterpoise to Soviet influence; (3) to protect U.S.
                            economic interests, and (4) to protect U.S. security interests.</p>

                        <p>The United States should maintain a restrained, deliberate attitude
                            toward Chile. In this manner we would maintain and exercise our
                            influence in Chile, and have considerable flexibility and initiative
                            while exploiting opportunities for pursuing our objectives.</p>
                        <p>Although events in Chile will be determined principally by internal
                            Chilean forces and therefore U.S. influence can have only a marginal
                            effect, the skillful exercise of our influence could be an important
                            factor in complicating <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            task, both by exacerbating the friction between the moderate and radical
                            elements in <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s coalition
                            and by bolstering those forces opposed to the establishment in Chile of
                            a Marxist-Leninist regime. The negative use of our influence—e.g.,
                            taking measures from the outset that manifest U.S. hostility toward the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government—would
                            serve <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s purpose of
                            rallying the Chilean people around him in the face of the “foreign
                            devil.” On the other hand, failure to take <hi rend="italic">any</hi>
                            steps to achieve our objectives would leave the initiative in his hands,
                            discourage opposition to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            in Chile, weaken our hemisphere leadership, and create serious problems
                            with public and Congressional opinion in the United States.</p>
                        <p>The principal targets of our courses of action with Chile would be the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government, the
                            Chilean security and military forces, the non-Marxist political forces,
                            and the Chilean public. Additional targets would be other Latin American
                            countries and the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>This option would be posited upon the belief that: (1) U.S. capabilities
                            short of the use of armed force are insufficient in themselves to
                            prevent the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government
                            from maintaining itself at least over the short run; (2) for the
                            foreseeable future the main course of events in Chile will be determined
                            primarily by the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            government and its reactions to internal pressures; (3) those internal
                            pressures favorable to our interests can best be fostered and encouraged
                            by maintaining as much U.S. presence and influence with the Chilean
                            people as is possible; (4) thus we should not take the initiative in
                            actions that would isolate us from Chile nor should we take the
                            initiative in actions that would tend to force Chile into dependency on
                            the Soviet Union; (5) we will be in the strongest position within Chile
                            and the hemisphere if it is clear that sanctions that we take against
                            Chile are in reaction to what the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"

                            the degree that it is interpreted that the U.S. has taken the initiative
                            in actions isolating itself from and creating a condition of <pb n="167"

                        <p>This option looks, therefore, to the longer run when, as we have
                            experienced elsewhere in communist countries, internal developments in
                            Chile may produce policies less hostile to our interests than the
                            short-run “revolutionary” period is likely to do. Such a development
                            should provide us with new opportunities for influencing the course of

                            objectives: (1) the prevention of establishment by the <persName

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Options</p>
                        <p>The paper suggests that there are four possible strategies which could be
                            considered:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Option A—Treat Chile as we do communist nations that
                                seek independence from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            </hi> (Modus vivendi)</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">basic premises and judgments</hi> of this option
                            are:</p>
                        <p>—There is nothing that we can do short of armed force to bring <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> down.</p>
                        <p>—The course of events in Chile will be determined primarily by <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and internal factors.</p>
                        <p>—Internal pressures favorable to our interests can best be fostered by
                            maintaining as much US presence and influence in Chile as possible.
                            Therefore, we should not take initiatives which would isolate us from
                            Chile or force Chile into dependency on <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>—We should react to what <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            does rather than what we fear he may do; to the extent we initiate

                                >Allende</persName>’s position.</p>

                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">keynote of this option</hi> is maintenance of a

                            We would retain Chile in Ex-Im Bank’s worst risk category, not encourage

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">There is a fundamental difference between the last
                                option and the first three.</hi> Option A concedes <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s continued existence and
                            concludes that we really have no choice but to relate to that situation.
                            The next three, on the other hand, assume a basically adversary aim—and
                            capacity—to contain or change the situation and flow of events although
                            they vary as to method, intensity and tactical objectives.</p>
                        <p>The basic difference highlights the importance of our basic perception
                            about the nature of the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            regime and its prospects. <hi rend="italic">The validity of Option A

                            situation, the likelihood is that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"

                            only redound to his benefit.</p>
                        <p>If these judgments are correct, then this option has the merit of giving
                            us the best chance of maintaining a US presence in Chile and of

                            This strategy would also provide <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> the least excuse for seeking Soviet support and
                            presence, and would avoid the danger of our being accused of “pushing”
                            Chile into Russia’s hands. It would also raise the least controversy and
                            concern in the rest of the world and hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The problem with Option A</hi> is that it is not clear
                            that its basic premises <hi rend="italic">are</hi> correct. The <gloss
                                target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 97 paper concluded that the
                            likelihood is that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            <hi rend="italic">can</hi> overcome his weaknesses and opposition and
                            achieve his goals if he has time and room for maneuver. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s demonstrated “game plan” so
                            far, in fact, is clearly aimed at gaining time to consolidate himself
                            and to avoiding the pressures our hostility might provide. Therefore,
                            the question is at least raised whether Option A’s strategy would not
                            play into <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s hands, and
                            forego whatever <pb n="180" facs="0220" xml:id="pg_180"/>chance there
                            may be for us to intensify his problems in the crucial formative first
                            year. To the extent that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            accepted our relationship, we might actually help entrench him.</p>
                        <p>This strategy would also leave the strategic initiative in <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s hands. If he <hi
                                rend="italic">wants</hi> to adopt an anti-US course, the courses of
                            action outlined in Option A will not prevent or deter him. The argument
                            might also be made that this kind of posture may be interpreted as
                            impotence and indifference by the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            and other hemisphere nations respectively.</p>
                        <p>Finally, there is the question of whether we can consistently carry out
                            this strategy. Our capacity to sidestep confrontation is limited, given
                            mandatory legislative sanctions we would have to apply in the event of
                            certain actions, and, therefore, we may not be able to avoid an
                            adversary posture.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The Adversary Posture</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As noted, the next three options have a basically different perception of
                            the situation—viz., that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            will follow an anti-US policy, has a basic anti-US bias, and will not
                            find it in his interest to modify his goals just to get along with us;
                            that the likelihood is that he <hi rend="italic">will</hi> succeed in
                            consolidating his power and achieving his goals if left to his own game
                            plan; that it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> possible for us to sharpen and
                            intensify his problems and weaknesses; that confrontation is inevitable
                            sooner or later; and that, therefore, only some kind of adversary
                            posture promises to best contain or limit the adverse impact on our
                            interests of an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            government.</p>
                        <p>The basic question raised by these judgments is: <hi rend="italic">What
                                can we realistically hope to achieve by an adversary
                            posture</hi>?</p>
                        <p>Experience has demonstrated that we have virtually no capacity to
                            engineer <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s <hi
                                rend="italic">overthrow</hi> in the present situation. The last
                            three options therefore, posit as their minimum goal the creation of
                            pressures and circumstances which might cause or force <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to fail or to modify his goals
                            and as a maximum the creation of circumstances which might lead to his
                            collapse or overthrow more easily later. A correlative objective is to
                            contain the adverse impact of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s policies on our interests in the rest of the
                            hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>The variations in the three options result from their different responses
                            to these tactical issues:</p>
                        <p>—which strategy or posture will maximize our chances for achieving our
                            objectives at the least political cost;</p>
                        <p>—how overt does our adversary posture have to be, and what are the
                            liabilities if it is;</p>
                        <p>—should we initiate hostile measures or just “counter-punch”?</p>
                        <pb n="181" facs="0221" xml:id="pg_181"/>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">value of Option D</hi> is that it is
                            straightforward and unambiguous. It leaves no one in doubt as to our
                            position, and avoids the risk that we will be perceived as indifferent
                            or as supporting <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. It
                            would permit us to concentrate maximum pressure.</p>
                        <p>The principal disadvantage is that overt hostility initiated by us is the
                            least effective way to project pressure. The punitive public image of
                            this strategy gives <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> the
                            best chance to blunt the impact of our actions by exploiting nationalism
                            and latent fear of “US intervention” to rally domestic support in Chile
                            and international sympathy. He can use the “foreign devil” argument as
                            an excuse for his mistakes and a reason for taking even more radical
                            measures. In short, this strategy is somewhat a counterpart of Option A
                            in that it also risks helping <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> entrench himself.</p>
                        <p>The proposed courses of action would also almost surely divide the
                            hemisphere and create opposition and suspicion of us in a number of
                            countries. We would undercut the credibility of our claim to respect
                            self-determination and the democratic process. Because the overt style
                            threatens to blunt the impact of our pressure we may incur the
                            disadvantages of public hostility and still fail to have significant
                            impact—the worst of all worlds.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">value of Option B</hi> is that it minimizes the
                            liabilities of overt hostility with more certainty, and provides greater
                            flexibility to meet situations as they develop—we are in better position
                            to harden or soften our actions as circumstances may warrant.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The disadvantage</hi> is that this strategy is
                            essentially ambiguous and may be internally contradictory. The mixture
                            of measures to hamper him on the one hand and to keep a flexible posture
                            on the other threaten to undercut each other. Thus, we would appear to
                            take measures in some instances to hamper <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>—e.g., covert pressures, reducing bilateral
                            aid—while taking some measures in different instances—maintaining
                            selective US programs—whose effect is to strengthen him and give him
                            legitimacy. One could argue that this option is essentially a
                            compromise, and that the accumulated nuances do not make clear whether
                            it is really an adversary posture or a variation of Option A.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">value of Option C</hi> is that it promises
                            precisely to avoid the dangers of overt hostility by maintaining a
                            correct public posture, undertaking hostile measures publicly only in
                            reaction to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> (the
                            “counter-punch”), but mounting approximately the same non-overt
                            pressures and efforts to intensify internal problems. By thus avoiding
                            giving <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> an excuse to use
                            us as a credible whipping boy, it promises to maximize the effectiveness
                            of such pressures. Moreover, by being cold and correct we maintain a
                            relationship but with minimum award of legitimacy or respectability to
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="182" facs="0222" xml:id="pg_182"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Its disadvantage</hi> is that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> may still gain some domestic
                            political benefit from the sheer coldness of our public posture,
                            claiming that that is initiated hostility. We would still have
                            difficulty gaining unanimous Latin American and European support or
                            cooperation for our policies, and our public stand of hostility to
                            Communism would be a letter more ambiguous than in the case of Option D.
                            To maintain a correct relationship, moreover, we may have to forego some
                            kinds of pressure in given instances.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>I. Mr. President, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Salvador
                                Allende</persName>, the Chilean Marxist, has now taken office as
                            President in that country with virtually no significant opposition to
                            hold him in check, and with a cabinet dominated by the Communists and
                            his own even more extreme Socialist Party.</p>
                        <p>II. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> was a narrow winner
                            in the three-way presidential elections on September 4, when his Popular
                            Unity coalition got him 36.6 percent of the vote.</p>
                        <p>A. The orthodox pro-Moscow Communist Party of Chile put together the
                            Popular Unity coalition, chose <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> as the candidate, and provided the
                            organizational base for his election.</p>
                        <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> himself belongs to the
                            Socialist Party. This is a Marxist, nationalist party with a strong
                            faction committed to violent revolution, rather than the parliamentary
                            road to power favored by the Moscow-line Chilean Communist Party.</p>
                        <p>1. The Socialists, in fact, earlier this year appeared to be ready to
                            jettison Allende. He has been the perennial Marxist candidate, but the
                            extreme left wing of the Socialist Party mistrusts him. This radical
                            wing <pb n="183" facs="0223" xml:id="pg_183"/>feels that he has not been
                            a firm supporter of violent revolution, but has favored alliances with
                            the Communists with a view to parliamentary victory.</p>
                        <p>2. The leftwingers—who could gain control of the Socialist Party in
                            coming months—feel that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>,
                            under Communist tutelage, would move cautiously to turn Chile into a
                            Communist state. In contrast, they believe that the current situation is
                            favorable for a massive, radical, and violent consolidation of
                            power.</p>
                        <p>III. Chilean election law provides that when no presidential candidate
                            receives a majority, the president will be chosen in a run-off by both
                            houses of Congress meeting jointly.</p>
                        <p>A. The forces which might have opposed <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> in that Congressional vote on October 24 were
                            not only fragmented, but were left leaderless before the Congress
                            met.</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Radomiro Tomic</persName>, the candidate
                            of outgoing President <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Eduardo
                                Frei</persName>’s Christian Democrats, recognized <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> on the heels of the popular
                            vote as president-elect, because of his plurality.</p>
                        <p>2. In a special Christian Democratic congress, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> and other left-wing leaders
                            overrode moderate elements and voted to support <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. Conservative former president <persName corresp="#p_ARJ_1">Jorge
                                Alessandri</persName>, who had trailed by only 40,000 in the popular
                            vote, at first planned to make a strong fight in the run-off. But on
                            October 9—after the Christian Democratic caucus decided to support
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>—Alessandri asked his
                            followers not to vote for him.</p>
                        <p>IV. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> forces, even
                            before the run-off, were moving quickly and forcefully to ensure his
                            inauguration and to consolidate control.</p>
                        <p>A. Methods ranging from soothing persuasion to terrorist threats were
                            used effectively to make his presidency appear palatable—and
                            inevitable.</p>
                        <p>1. His supporters exerted major influence on the information media,
                            either maneuvering their way in, or simply declaring their authority in
                            the name of the forthcoming regime.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and his close
                            associates contacted many important Chileans in political, economic, and
                            such professional fields as education, to reassure them that cooperation
                            would pay.</p>
                        <p>3. Grass-roots support for <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> was whipped up by some 8,000 Popular Unity
                            Committees in factories and neighborhoods, organized originally as
                            campaign forces for <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            popular election. These groups, largely controlled by the Communist
                            Party, will apparently be kept in being and expanded to provide local
                            propaganda, control, and intelligence.</p>

                        <p>B. On October 24, 195 of the 200 legislators in the full Congress showed
                            up. (<persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> himself did not
                            vote, and four others were ill.)</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> got 153 votes—74 of
                            them from the Christian Democrats. Their 19 senators and 55 national
                            deputies followed party orders to vote for <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. Alessandri got 35 votes from the National Party.</p>
                        <p>3. Seven members of the Congress abstained.</p>
                        <p>V. Even before the election, there had been speculation that as a last
                            resort the Chilean military would not permit a Marxist government to
                            take office.</p>
                        <p>A. Many high-ranking officers had expressed opposition to <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, and a few had told United
                            States officials that as a Marxist, he would not be allowed to become
                            president if he should win.</p>
                        <p>B. When <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> won his
                            plurality, a number of high officers—including troop commanders and the
                            head of the Air Force—were casting about for ways, means, and support to
                            prevent a Marxist government.</p>
                        <p>1. This group included General <persName corresp="#p_HCV_1">Vicente
                                Huerta</persName>, commandant of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >carabineros</hi>, who has now been replaced.</p>
                        <p>2. A number of them still expressed optimism that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would be defeated in the
                            Congressional run-off.</p>
                        <p>C. To sum up the situation between the election on September 4 and the
                            inauguration on November 3, there <hi rend="italic">were</hi> some
                            important elements in both the military and political establishments
                            which perceived that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            should not be allowed to bring a Marxist regime into office. Also
                            present, there was an array of power factors which—if it had been united
                            and totally committed to a plan—could have prevented <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s assumption of the
                            presidency.</p>
                        <p>1. As the situation developed, however, the faction which controlled the
                            Christian Democratic Party was determined to reach an accommodation with
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, and would <hi
                                rend="italic">not</hi> consider an <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi>
                            political alliance with the National Party to stop him.</p>
                        <p>2. The military, for its part, was committed to support the
                            constitutionally-elected president, both by its non-political tradition,
                            and through the firm conviction and explicit policy of the Army
                            commander-in-chief, General <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1">René
                                Schneider</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. Those diverse groups of military and political leaders who <hi
                                rend="italic">did</hi> wish to prevent an <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> presidency at no time acted in
                            concert nor demonstrated the courage to move.</p>
                        <p>D. This immobilism can be attributed in a considerable degree to the
                            existing climate of public opinion. The Chilean people had been softened
                            up and conditioned for six years to accept revolutionary lan<pb n="185"
                                facs="0225" xml:id="pg_185"/>guage, not only coming from the
                            Communists and Socialists, but generated by the ruling Christian
                            Democrats themselves.</p>
                        <p>1. The Chilean government had permitted the Soviets and the local
                            Marxists to carry on their political action and propaganda activities
                            without hindrance.</p>
                        <p>2. As a result, the Chileans viewed the coming of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> with apprehension and unease,
                            but <hi rend="italic">not</hi> with the repugnance and gut concern which
                            could have led to action.</p>
                        <p>E. Essentially, each element in the power structure—the political and the
                            military—looked to the other to provide the leadership, but <hi
                                rend="italic">no</hi> leader with the clout to bring it off was
                            willing to step forward at the crucial moment.</p>
                        <p>1. Among the military, the negative attitude of Army commander <persName
                                corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName> was a blocking factor,
                            whether it stemmed from dedication to the constitution, or a reported
                            preference for <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. It
                            influenced General <persName corresp="#p_PGC_1">Carlos Prats</persName>,
                            who became Army commander when <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1"
                                >Schneider</persName> was assassinated. In early stages, some
                            officers had considered <persName corresp="#p_PGC_1">Prats</persName>
                            the best potential leader against <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>.</p>
                        <p>F. Retired Army General <persName corresp="#p_VMR_1">Roberto
                                Viaux</persName>, who had led an earlier abortive military revolt to
                            improve the position and perquisites of the military, was actively
                            seeking support for a coup attempt.</p>
                        <p>G. Most of the senior active officers, however, feared the risks involved
                            in the communication and coordination essential for choosing a leader
                            and ensuring support from their fellow officers and troops.</p>
                        <p>1. As the deadline for action approached, the cooperation of troop
                            commanders in the Santiago area—considered a necessity—was not assured.
                            Divisions among leading officers became more evident, for example by the
                            calls which several admirals paid on <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>.</p>
                        <p>H. <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName>’s assassination
                            unified the military, but the shock of it unified them <hi rend="italic"
                                >against</hi> any likelihood of a coup to keep <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> from office. In addition, the
                            assassination provided an excuse for some to take no action.</p>
                        <p>VI. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> announced his cabinet
                            a few days before his takeover.</p>
                        <p>A. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> himself—and probably
                            the Communists—would prefer for the time being to project a non-radical
                            image.</p>
                        <p>B. Let us make no mistake, however: This is a hard-line, militant
                            cabinet. It reflects the determination of the Socialists to assert their
                            more radical policy from the start. The Communists have countered by
                            holding out for the key economic and patronage ministries. In satisfying
                            both, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has wound up with
                            a cabinet clearly dominated by these two parties at the expense of the
                            other members of the coalition.</p>
                        <p>VII. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s attainment of the
                            presidency with only about one third of the country’s vote climaxes a
                            highly successful political career of nearly 35 years.</p>
                        <pb n="186" facs="0226" xml:id="pg_186"/>
                        <p>A. The man knows how to achieve his ends. He knows the political forces
                            of the country inside and out. He has a thorough familiarity with the
                            governmental and economic structures he plans to revolutionize, in the
                            course of building the socialism he claims will solve Chile’s many
                            serious problems.</p>
                        <p>1. He is tenacious and singleminded, but he knows how to dissemble his
                            determination with a flair for maneuvering, a quick wit, and an instinct
                            for when to reassure and when to challenge.</p>
                        <p>2. He has also demonstrated in the past that he is adept at remaining in
                            command of a quarreling coalition by playing off rival forces against
                            each other—a balancing act he will have to rely on to set his own pace
                            for change when the Socialists want to proceed full tilt with the
                            proclamation of a Marxist Chile, while the Communists call for a more
                            deliberate construction of the foundations.</p>
                        <p>B. We do not expect an immediate flood of radical constitutional
                            revisions to consolidate his political and economic control. The
                            constitution already gives the president broad powers of executive
                            decree—recently enlarged by the Frei government. With the next
                            congressional elections set for 1973, he has ample time to obtain the
                            legislation he may need without triggering opposition by hasty and
                            alarming demands.</p>
                        <p>C. We expect that his first economic moves will be aimed at control of
                            the major mining, industrial and financial enterprises that he considers
                            essential to his plans.</p>
                        <p>1. These assets, combined with the substantial foreign exchange reserves
                            he inherits from the outgoing government, will put his regime in good
                            financial shape at the outset.</p>
                        <p>2. Recent high copper prices and extensive recent U.S. investment in
                            expanded copper production in Chile are additional bonuses for the new
                            regime, although world copper prices have been dropping, and there are
                            indications that supply is approaching demand.</p>
                        <p>3. He and his main economic advisers are concerned, however, about the
                            deterioration of the internal economy since his election.</p>
                        <p>D. He has described inflation as the most urgent problem of the
                            moment.</p>
                        <p>E. His program for socialism will be facilitated by the already
                            preponderant role of the Chilean government in nearly every field of
                            economic activity. The private enterprise system has already been
                            distorted by 30 years of rapid inflation and government
                            intervention.</p>
                        <p>VIII. In the international economic field, we expect that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, at the start at least, will
                            move with caution and with considerable regard for the realities. He has
                            asserted his interest in foreign capital and technology as long as “the
                            benefits are mutual.”</p>
                        <pb n="187" facs="0227" xml:id="pg_187"/>
                        <p>A. Understandably, foreign investors will be wary of a professedly
                            Marxist regime, and new foreign credits will be harder to come by.</p>
                        <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and his
                            representatives have reiterated in public and in private their hopes of
                            retaining Chile’s traditional hard currency markets in Western Europe,
                            Japan, and elsewhere for their copper, iron, and other exports, as well
                            as plans for expanding into Communist markets.</p>
                        <p>1. We know that <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName> has
                            advised <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to keep Chile’s
                            copper sales in hard currency.</p>
                        <p>C. U.S. private assets in Chile total about one and a half billion
                            dollars, of which slightly less than half consists of Chilean government
                            notes issued for nationalization, holdings of public bonds, and long-
                            and short-term loans.</p>
                        <p>1. We estimate the book value of direct U.S. investment at $800 million,
                            although replacement would be considerably higher. More than half—$480
                            million—is in mining and smelting.</p>
                        <p>2. As of September 10, U.S. investors had A.I.D. current investment
                            insurance against expropriation amounting to $293 million, and standby
                            coverage for another $355 million.</p>
                        <p>IX. As for foreign relations, many governments are skeptical of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s aims, but anxious to avoid
                            an appearance of prejudging him.</p>
                        <p>A. The pleas he has made so far for international understanding would
                            appear to be contradicted by the appointment of the radical <persName
                                corresp="#p_AMC_1">Clodomiro Almeyda</persName> as Foreign
                            Minister.</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_AMC_1">Almeyda</persName> is so far to the left
                            that his admiration for the Chinese Communists and the Cubans in the
                            past has placed him in opposition to Moscow.</p>
                        <p>B. Several Latin American governments, including in particular Argentina,
                            are deeply concerned over the possible effect of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government on political
                            stability inside their own countries.</p>
                        <p>1. A reliable clandestine source reports that in late October <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> promised representatives of
                            revolutionary guerrilla groups in Latin America that Chile would become
                            a center of support for them as soon as he is firmly in control.</p>
                        <p>C. There is every indication and every reason to expect that—whatever
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> may say or
                            intend—the forces around him will use every opportunity to exacerbate
                            relations with the United States.</p>
                        <p>1. The personal emissary <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            sent to our Embassy in Santiago said there was little the new president
                            could do to curb the constant attacks on the United States in the
                            Chilean press.</p>
                        <p>E. As for the Soviet Union, Moscow is showing caution in dealing with the
                            new government. In turn, the Chilean Socialists will want to avoid
                            excessive dependence on Moscow, and the Chilean Commu<pb n="188"
                                facs="0228" xml:id="pg_188"/>nists—for the sake of their domestic
                            appeal—will exercise restraint in promoting closer ties with Russia.</p>
                        <p>1. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> extended a credit of $57
                            million to Chile in 1967, none of which has been used. Chilean economic
                            problems, however, will inevitably create the opportunity for Moscow to
                            use this for leverage with the new Marxist government.</p>

                        <p>4735. Subj: Post inauguration <gloss target="#t_sitrep_1"
                            >sitrep</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>1. Following is personal assessment, delayed by press of inauguration
                            activities, of Chilean situation. Since important policy decisions may
                            be taken, it is forwarded at this time. It is based on talks this week
                            with <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, Frei, leading
                            Communist, Christian Democratic, and Radical politicians, the chiefs of
                            the armed forces and US businessmen.</p>
                        <p>2. There is universal agreement here that the threat to Chile and beyond
                            is the degree and pace of Communist control. The new govt of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is notable because the
                            Communists (unlike the Popular Front of 1938 here with which <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> made comparisons in his talk
                            to Asst Secy <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>) have
                            deliberately chosen to assume primary responsibility for the economy.
                            This time it is not leaving itself an out. By so doing, as outgoing
                            MinFinance <persName corresp="#p_ZLA_1">Zaldivar</persName> underlined,
                            it has taken those jobs that will give the Communists the administrative
                            handles necessary for its gradualist quest for domination.</p>
                        <p>3. Control of the Ministries of Economy, Finance, and Labor go far beyond
                            the obvious. For example, the Finance portfolio includes the Internal
                            Revenue Bureau which is a political instrument of tremendous potential;
                            Economy includes all price control; the Labor Ministry, when combined
                            with the Communist leadership of the Confederation of Trade Unions and
                            Communist control of what will be a vastly expanded Public Works
                            Ministry, will provide the <gloss target="#t_PCCh_1">PCCh</gloss> with
                            tremendous give-or-take leverage over unions as well as management in
                            what mixed and private companies may remain.</p>
                        <p>4. The Communists have deliberately eschewed responsibility for security
                            and defense matters. There the Socialists have taken the nominal control
                            although the Communists are at the very minimum pro<pb n="190"
                                facs="0230" xml:id="pg_190"/>tecting themselves with key slots, such
                            as the Undersecretary of Interior. Already the military is very nervous
                            about the implications for them and the country of this Marxist
                            exclusivity in the most sensitive sector; the Marxists will control the
                            US equivalent of all police forces, the <gloss target="#t_FBI_1"
                                >FBI</gloss>, border patrol, voting eligibility, and the Secret
                            Service. If the armed forces knew that the Cubans had already sent
                            security experts and that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s daughter Beatriz (who has particularly strong
                            influence over her father) is about to marry the Cuban in charge of all
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>-type activities in Latin
                            America they would be even more disquieted.</p>
                        <p>5. Equally significant is that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> is obsessed with the notion that there is a plot
                            to kill him. Frei and others have remarked on the acuteness of the new
                            President’s fear. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> talks
                            of people planning to drop bombs on his home from helicopters and of all
                            manner of assassination plots; he insists on having every conceivable
                            precaution, of the need to constantly change autos, to wear bullet-proof
                            vests and the like. There is no question that he is deliberately being
                            fed a conspiratorial theory in which the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss> and others are always involved so that he will be more
                            pliable politically.</p>
                        <p>6. This obsession, in turn, may lead to the decision to convert the
                            current investigation of the murder of General <persName
                                corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName> into a political weapon
                            against many respectable opponents and very possibly show trials at some
                            point. In any event the senseless <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1"
                                >Schneider</persName> assassination has provided the Marxists with a
                            pressure instrument that is already being effectively employed against
                            the national party to gain compliance and cooperation.</p>
                        <p>7. In these circumstances the armed forces wish above all to maintain
                            normality with the US. Because of their fears that they will be cut off
                            by the US and forced to buy elsewhere, possibly from the Communist bloc,
                            they are extremely anxious to have proof now that the US will continue
                            to sell spare parts and new equipment. While they are reacting
                            negatively to the <gloss target="#t_AFTAC_1">AFTAC</gloss> phaseout, the
                            simultaneous airlift of a US propeller shaft to the navy had positive
                            impact. But the critical decisions lie ahead almost immediately.</p>
                        <p>8. The air force has made known for some time its desire to buy three
                                <gloss target="#t_C130_1">C–130</gloss>s from us and has talked
                            about the purchase of <gloss target="#t_F5_1">F–5</gloss>s. Now, the new
                            Chilean AF CINC, Gen. <persName corresp="#p_RC_1">Ruiz</persName> sent
                            word to me 48 hours ago that he wishes to implement these purchases
                            quickly so as to foreclose any possibility of other sources of supply.
                            The official decree authorizing purchase of the three <gloss

                            intervention with the <gloss target="#t_F5_1">F–5</gloss>s if the
                            Chileans were to deal directly, as they want, with the commercial
                            sellers. The army and the navy will have similar <pb n="191" facs="0231"
                                xml:id="pg_191"/>desires although the former can acquire other
                            equipment, as they have in the past, from Europe, and the latter has
                            four units under construction in the UK. All told, the three services
                            have been authorized to spend roughly $85 million in purchases abroad
                            for new equipment predicated on the assumption that the new govt will
                            not seek to reverse their decisions and that the military’s sources of
                            revenue from the copper law will not be changed. The military, despite
                            its lack of intervention to prevent <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> from taking office, will be one of the major
                            elements in combination with the economic evolution, the role of
                            political opposition and the behaviour of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> in determining whether Chile will be an
                            irreversible Communist state linked to Moscow or not.</p>
                        <p>9. By any measure, the economic situation will not be easy for the
                            Marxist to handle. Despite the $500 million cushion in foreign currency
                            that the country will have at year’s end, the kinds of profound social
                            transformations that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has
                            promised, the inflationary pressures, the expected drop in agricultural
                            production, the disappointment of workers over the delays in acquiring
                            new advantages and other factors will not make for easy economic
                            management. Hence <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and
                            the Communists will move in such a way as to maintain access to
                            international credit, loans, technology and technicians. The reaction to
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s election has
                            reinforced a go-slow tactic on the Marxists who in any case have a
                            strategic motivation for wishing to avoid what the political genius of
                            the Communist Party, <persName corresp="#p_TV_1">Velodia
                                Teitelboim</persName>, described to me as a “catastrophic” concept.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> intends to make
                            payment promptly of international debt obligations; there will be an
                            effort to arrive at nationalization arrangements that will not be
                            confiscatory, there will be dollar contract offers to foreign
                            technicians and there will be a deliberative case by case rather than a
                            blanket implementation of the state’s take-over of remaining private
                            industry and major services. Perhaps the most sensitive decision will be
                            the previously-stated goal of nationalization of the banks, a move that
                            would provide an important political instrument for the Communists in
                            addition to the economic leverage; it would provide them with legal
                            control over all bank deposits, credit lines and the like.</p>
                        <p>10. The Communist decision to assume command of the economy has already
                            limited the options of the political opposition and served to divide it.
                            The Christian Democratic forces loyal to Frei who are preparing to
                            regain control of the party Nov 28 at the next party Junta
                            (convention)—and I believe they will win this time—are encountering very
                            knotty problems in acquiring the major radio station and newspaper they
                            thought they could buy by now. The Alessandrista owners of Radio
                            Cooperativa have raised the price five-fold in three weeks and the
                            similarly-oriented proprietors of the daily <hi rend="italic">La
                                Tercera</hi> jumped their price several-fold. Both groups of
                            empresarios are reacting to the new <pb n="192" facs="0232"
                                xml:id="pg_192"/>govt’s promises to permit them to operate their
                            other businesses normally and to be treated preferentially in any
                            nationalization if they do not take such “hostile” actions as selling
                            their media properties to the Frei forces. The <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> may surmount these problems, but they are indicative of
                            the times.</p>
                        <p>11. The <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> is, whatever our views of
                            that party, the only effective potential opposition remaining in Chile.
                            The National Party has been badly hurt by the <persName
                                corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName> killing, particularly when
                            so many, as Silvia Alessandri noted this week to me, of those implicated
                            were Alessandri militants and when one of the killers is a nephew of the
                            very respectable Nacional Senator <persName corresp="#p_BSF_1"
                                >Bulnes</persName> whose self-description is “total runi”.
                            Alessandri himself maintains his unchanging scorn for the Nacionales and
                            all parties and he recognizes, as do I, that at least half of the more
                            than 1 million who voted for him are not potential recruits for the
                            National Party but rather anti-Marxists who would prefer to be
                            identified with the center or even the left. I agree with President
                            Frei’s observation that more than one-third and possibly one-half of
                            Chile is middle-class by local definition and that the political
                            opposition must be based on this arithmetic. This calculation does not
                            rpt not mean that the National Party will or should disappear; it will
                            probably continue to draw about 15 percent of the vote and if the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> were to be regained by Frei, it would
                            be a necessary foil to strengthen the centrist position of the outgoing
                            President.</p>
                        <p>12. Chile by habit offers the incoming President at least 100 days of
                            benevolent forebearance. Additionally, there will be the natural
                            bandwagon propensity that will gain many adherents to the triumphant
                            parties. Hence if Frei rewins his party, he will pursue a tactic of
                            “loyal” opposition, of supporting measures for more schools, hospitals
                            and houses but raising a hullabaloo if, for example, by legal or
                            extra-legal means the freedom of parties to operate are infringed upon.
                            Hence the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> would oppose bank
                            nationalization, would bring to public view the role of Cuban or other
                            security experts and would seek to divide <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> from the Communists. Neither Frei nor anyone
                            else has any illusions about the difficulties ahead; the outgoing
                            President puts the odds of maintaining a democratic structure at
                            somewhere around ten to one and describes this forecast as “perhaps
                            optimistic”. However in order to forge a broad-banded appeal that would
                            include a large slice of the Alessandri clientele, it is an
                            indispensable prerequisite that the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>
                            have some effective instruments of media expression and that it acquire
                            them very soon.</p>
                        <p>13. The <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> is somewhat less divided now
                            than a month ago. <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_VPP_1">Valdes</persName> and some others
                            continue to believe that the party’s target should be entrance into the
                            government so that their weight would be felt. The Communists also would
                            prefer this tactic so as to <pb n="193" facs="0233" xml:id="pg_193"
                            />eliminate any opposition but the very vulnerable right and so as to
                            destroy Frei and his followers. <persName corresp="#p_VPP_1"
                                >Valdes</persName> believes he can be the 1976 President, as the
                            Communists have encouraged him to think; he believes that the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> can influence <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> from within the govt so as to
                            prevent a Communist takeover. Whereas <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName> is discredited in the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss>, even with many of his most ardent followers, <persName
                                corresp="#p_VPP_1">Valdes</persName> is much more credible and
                            convincing as an outgoing Frei minister, as a member of Chile’s
                            aristocracy, as one who boasts of having “excellent” relations with
                            Washington and the rest of the world and as one who projects a
                            captivating personality. <persName corresp="#p_VPP_1">Valdes</persName>
                            was proposed last night by the very influential elder statesman
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGB_1">Bernardo Leighton</persName> to be the
                            next <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> President.</p>
                        <p>14. As for the last major internal factor, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> himself, it is difficult to do more than relate
                            some of his characteristics. He is a heavy drinker; he chases women; he
                            is extremely vain; he surrounds himself at long convivial lunches with
                            sycophants; and then takes a daily siesta; he has rented a luxurious
                            home with swimming pool and tennis court. He views himself as a strong
                            leader; he has a reputation for living up to his word; he is a very weak
                            Marxist theoretician but he believes in its basic tenets; he is a smart
                            politician. To me, this catalogues up to an evident lack of day-to-day
                            control over government and to an extraordinary opportunity for those
                            who are as calculating, well-organized and talented as the Communists.
                            Moreover it is the Communists who will provide the support for the
                            go-slow approach to international relations that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> favors by conviction and by
                            proclivity. They will cater to his personal idiosyncrasies and to his
                            doctrinal debilities to hold off the more extremist elements and to
                            manipulate the ineffectual opportunists over whom they have considerable
                            influence. It is noteworthy but not surprising that the Communists and
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> have avoided giving
                            the other four parties any meaningful role in the govt and last night at
                            the national stadium in his first major speech, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> completely contradicted his

                            equally significant that the Communists completely dominated the staging
                            of last night’s show and displayed their pre-eminence without
                            reticence.</p>
                        <p>15. Everyone here agrees too that the role of the US will be crucial to
                            the plans of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. All
                            opponents are of one mind in urging that the US not rpt not provide the
                            justification for a quick radicalization of the situation. It is also
                            the counsel of our friendly Communist Party. My own preference would be
                            to maintain a public posture of restrained correctness, of encouraging
                            the democratic opposition, of seeking to hold our military connections
                            (so that the new purchases for the entire decade will be dependent on
                            and vulnerable to US action at any time) <pb n="194" facs="0234"

                            have rejected the across-the-board hostility theory on the grounds that
                            it would not have a determinant impact on the economy here while it
                            would serve to mobilize nationalist sentiment so as to strengthen the

                        <p>Purpose was to discuss Amb/<gloss target="#t_CAS_1">CAS</gloss> proposal
                            for 303 Committee for funds for anti-Marxist new Radical Party (<gloss

                                <persName corresp="#p_CJH_1">Crimmins</persName> made case in his

                            concerns were natural and <pb n="195" facs="0235" xml:id="pg_195"
                            />useful but that question was “are we going to have a popular front or

                        <p>Critical exchange came when <persName corresp="#p_CWR_1">Coerr</persName>

                            military would accept victory, that <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>
                            would be weakened. Part of it being attracted to support <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> against Communists and that
                            there would be internal divisions within U.P. “<persName
                                corresp="#p_CWR_1">Coerr</persName> commented an <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> victory not the same as a
                            Communist victory in that case. <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName> agreed but said that operationally one must treat
                            an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> victory as the same;
                            it would be imprudent to act as if an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> victory would be anything but another <persName

                        <p>Then <persName corresp="#p_CJH_1">Crimmins</persName> asked “what
                            difference it would make if we did not become involved—seeing how
                            sensitive involvement may be versus what we may gain. Ambassador noted
                            it easy to do nothing but we may have to ask ourselves if <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> wins, especially by few votes,
                            whether we might better have become involved.”</p>
                        <p>Meeting agreed then to accept modest Emb/<gloss target="#t_CAS_1"
                                >CAS</gloss> proposal with proviso it could not be used to support

                            election perspectives sent by <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName>. First para states: “Our preoccupation is with the
                            concomitant—indeed greater—concern that Chile may emerge from its
                            presidential elections on a course towards emulation of <persName
                                corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName>’s regime. . . . It is
                            essential that attention be focussed on our preeminent worry: —a
                            democratic process putting into power a Marxist regime dedicated to the
                            elimination of US interests and influence in the area. Unfortunately my
                            reiteration for some two years has converted this concern into a humdrum
                            banality elsewhere, thrust aside by more immediate challenges. But the
                            same four stark points must be faced:” (Cable goes on to substantiate
                            this preoccupation.)</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> rebuts very strongly
                            the Anaconda case arguing that the company’s judgment and discretion had
                            been consistently disastrous, that Alessandri could find the needed
                            funds, that he was far ahead in [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] polls and that we should stay out of the race as
                            long as we could to keep the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>
                            neutralized since it still held the govt.</p>
                        <p>6. June 12. Santiago 2210 <gloss target="#t_Limdis_1">Limdis</gloss>,
                            recalled that <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>’s working
                            assumptions for two years had been the base strengths of the candidates
                                <pb n="196" facs="0236" xml:id="pg_196"/>were 35–37 per cent for
                            Alessandri, 32–34 per cent for <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> and 23–25 per cent for <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>. Cable noted that Alessandri’s
                            early lead had been significantly trimmed and he was in the 36–37 per
                            cent range, that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            improved and solidified his base at 32–34 per cent and <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> after gaining had reached a
                            ceiling of 27–28 per cent. Summary para ended: “The crucial question we
                            originally posed, together with its implications for US interests in
                            South America remains unchanged: the extent of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> appeal. One ever more apparent
                            factor is that the common Alessandri–<persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName> conviction that the gain of one is at the expense
                            of the other is not valid. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> benefits at least equally from the Alessandri
                            decline.” Cable analyzed foregoing and concluded with pointed remark
                            about importance of women’s vote.</p>
                        <p>7. June 18. Via <gloss target="#t_CAS_1">CAS</gloss> channel, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> made request for [<hi

                            foregoing cable and said that unless altered, these trends could well
                            culminate in the election of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> and as a consequence the inevitable imposition
                            of a Leninist state in South America. An <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> Presidency would result either from his winning
                            the first plurality in the Sept 4 balloting or finishing such a strong
                            second that the Congress might in the runoff prefer his election in
                            preference to that of Alessandri’s.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> then reviewed Embassy’s
                            tactics including the “major effort to convince all here, in Washington
                            and elsewhere of our total non-involvement in the campaign. Unless
                            everyone believed it, no one would.” Went on to say this had been
                            successfully accomplished. Emb/<gloss target="#t_CAS_1">CAS</gloss> had
                            also wooed Frei with the immediate post election period in mind, had
                            concentrated on good contacts with the army by satisfying their urgent
                            needs, had widely propagated view <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> was running very strong and had funded the

                            <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> justified his submission
                            of new action program on grounds it was “the Marxists strengths not the

                            because of our unanimous conviction that the consequences of an

                            be very grave for Chile and South America, sufficiently serious to
                            undermine totally the new Latin policy launched by the Oct 31 speech of

                            position is very much akin to that Moliere character who counselled:
                            ‘You should always act in conformity with the majority and never make
                            yourself conspicuous.’ To which I respond that I will neither make you
                            conspicuous nor can I guaranty any majority. But I do believe it is
                            prudent to seek some guaranty against a majority that would become very
                            conspicuous indeed in Latin America—that of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>. If he were to gain power, what would be our
                            response to those who asked what did we do? I am seeking by political
                            action all that I can conceive to get the Chileans to muster their own
                            forces—and I think with some success. But when I examine those three
                            areas that contain almost 55 per cent of the electorate—Santiago,
                            Valparaiso and Concepcion Provinces—I see considerable <persName

                            conclude that our inputs while imperfect and modest could conceivably
                            provide the margin of safety. I am aware that we have no iron clad
                            assurances of enduring secrecy; I am also troubled by many of the doubts
                            that provoked your cable and questions. But I would be derelict in my
                            convictions if I were not to flag the danger and to offer a proposal to

                            We also took account in this complex equation of the uncertain
                            effectiveness of the effort; the probability that, from the standpoint
                            of our interests in Chile all three candidates would be negative sooner

                            responsibility for them. “While I am the President’s representative, I
                            also depend in the first instance on your support and understanding.
                            Without such confidence, the self-assurance that makes for leadership is

                        <p>“What is extremely unsettling is the wide breach between us over
                            objectives. Our view is that the election of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would be the triumph by
                            democratic electoral means for the first time in history of a Communist
                            govt. We have consistently set forth this view without challenge from
                            Washington at any time heretofore. And by happenstance, our President on
                            July first in his nationwide TV hour made the point twice unequivocally
                            that no Communists had ever assumed power by democratic means. It would
                            not be stretching matters, I submit, to say the President built much of
                            his 50 minute argumentation on the general Asian subject around this
                            fact. If at any time previously our central thesis that the election of
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would signify the
                            imposition in Chile of a Communist regime of either the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName> or Ulbricht variety had
                            been challenged, we would have done our best to persuade you of the
                            contrary but would have ceded to your judgment and to your decision. But
                            because we assumed general agreement on this point and because we
                            anticipated the President’s arguments as they applied here, we decided
                            with great reluctance that the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> chances of victory were so strong that we had to

                            three candidates would be negative sooner or later’ since we feel that
                            the negative aspects of one transcend the other two and the election of
                            one would have repercussions far beyond Chile, as President <persName

                            minimal exposure risk and that the “conditioning” of Frei was normal
                            psychological action. His belief was that “<persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> is at least a strong second if not first”. As
                            for the money, “we must deal with the real world which was quite
                            different” than the assumption that money meant a properly organized and
                            executed Alessandri campaign. “To say <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName> and Alessandri and their supporters ‘should be
                            doing’ something will not make it happen. We waited long enough to
                            confirm they will not do it and that the threat we feared had
                            materialized.”</p>
                        <p>“Having assumed that our President and all his advisors would wish to
                            oppose an electoral triumph of a Communist candidate (which, whatever
                            the label, he is) because it would be harmful to the interests of the
                            U.S., we had, I sincerely believe, no choice than to ‘have done
                            something’. Indeed I would be derelict if I did not do something once I

                            assessment, particularly Frei. He asked for permission to see Frei after
                            stating: “Churchill said that ‘true genius resides in the capacity for

                            which the Dept invariably indulges and which is at the root of the
                            troubles flushed out in some of the recent task forces. The report I did
                            on Africa converted US policy from activism to restraint; the low
                            profile arguments I made to the previous administration from here and
                            which I have executed here are the antithesis of activism; the paper I
                            did for UnderSec Richardson on the future relationships of the US with
                            the LDCs was criticized for its retreat from helter-skelter activism;
                            the recommendations I have been discussing for the sharp reduction in
                            official US presence here is being opposed by bureaucrats who want to be
                            active in everything. Neither low profile nor the careful matching of
                            real US interests to US resource availability was intended to be

                            Above all I do not want you or the Embassy to be stimulating Chileans to

                        <p>a. On 3 November 1970, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Salvador
                                Allende</persName> became the first democratically-elected Marxist
                            head of state in the history of Latin America—despite the opposition of
                            the U.S. Government. As a result, U.S. prestige and interests in Latin
                            America and, to some extent, elsewhere are being affected materially at
                            a time when the U.S. can ill afford problems and in an area that has
                            been traditionally accepted as the U.S. “backyard.” The question arises,
                            then, as to why more energetic <pb n="204" facs="0244" xml:id="pg_204"
                            />measures were not taken by the U.S. Government to prevent <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s election.</p>
                        <p>b. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s election cannot be
                            charged to lack of early warning. The possibility of an <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> victory was apparent, indeed
                            acknowledged, as far back as 1968; and, the adverse consequences of an
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> in power, much
                            earlier. Ample attention was given this specter at all levels in the
                            Department of State, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, and White
                            House—individually and in special committee sessions—from mid-1968 until
                            the date of the election. Availability of funds for covert action was
                            never in question although the purpose to which they were devoted was
                            the subject of considerable litigation.</p>
                        <p>c. The basic problem was that reservations, almost philosophic in depth
                            at times, persisted in the Department of State from the outset and
                            suffocated consideration of a clear-cut, all-out effort to prevent
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s election:</p>
                        <p>—whether interference in the Chilean democratic process would be in the
                            ultimate interest of the U.S. (after weighing prospects of influencing
                            the outcome against the risks and consequences of disclosure), and,</p>
                        <p>—even conceding the wisdom of interference, whether the U.S. should
                            actively support a chosen candidate rather than merely oppose and
                            denigrate <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Translated into stark political realities, the issue was that of
                            Department of State being unwilling to consider supporting <persName
                                corresp="#p_ARJ_1">Jorge Alessandri</persName>, the conservative and
                            independent candidate, for the Presidency of Chile to whatever extent
                            necessary to assure his election over <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>. In the end, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s margin of victory over Alessandri was a thin
                            1.4% of the popular vote: slightly less than 40,000 ballots out of
                            almost 3,000,000 cast.</p>

                        <p>a. The covert action program to deny <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> the presidency was initiated in 1968, some
                            months before <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> had put
                            together his extreme left coalition and sixteen months before <persName

                            coalition’s standard bearer. At the time, Chilean political dynamics
                            suggested that:</p>
                        <p>—President <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Eduardo Frei</persName>’s
                            Christian Democratic Party was being rent by dissension and, thus, its
                            presidential candidates would not be a strong contender;</p>
                        <p>—the 1970 presidential election would be a three man race with <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> (or another extreme leftist of
                            his ilk) and Alessandri as the two top candidates; and,</p>
                        <p>—the Chilean Congress would decide the winner since none of the three
                            candidates would be able to attain a majority of the popular vote.</p>
                        <pb n="205" facs="0245" xml:id="pg_205"/>
                        <p>A limited covert action program was authorized to influence the
                            composition of the Chilean Congress in the March 1969 congressional
                            elections. [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] moderate
                            congressional candidates were chosen for support; [<hi rend="italic"
                                >number not declassified</hi>] were elected. The key elements of a
                            covert action mechanism suitable for election purposes was assembled and
                            tested at that time: radio and press outlets for propaganda; agent
                            channels into the extreme leftist coalition for intelligence; and, for
                            political action, contacts with a dissident element of a party being
                            wooed by the coalition. This mechanism was sustained in one guise or
                            another until the 1970 presidential election was concluded.</p>
                        <p>b. The wrap-up report on this initial covert action program was presented
                            to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s special
                            committee in April 1969. The report’s conclusions noted, among other
                            things, that:</p>
                        <p>—the outcome of the recent Congressional elections indicated political
                            polarization in Chile, and,</p>
                        <p>—“In the present political climate the Communist-Socialist front would
                            stand perhaps an even chance of victory for the presidency” as would
                            rightist Alessandri.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> raised the question
                            of a U.S. Government role in the still-distant presidential elections,
                            stating that support of Alessandri was already being urged from an
                            outside quarter. It was decided that further consideration of such a
                            role should be deferred until candidates were negotiated and formally
                            declared, but pointing out an early decision would be desirable since
                            careful preliminary work would be required for effective covert
                            action.</p>

                        <p>a. Final selection of the presidential contenders was not made until
                            December 1969 when <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> was
                            nominated as the candidate for a new extreme leftist coalition after a
                            protracted period of bitter and difficult negotiation. In the seven
                            month interlude following the Congressional elections, <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> preserved its covert action mechanism
                            with a campaign to weaken <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s coalition and to encourage prospective
                            presidential candidates within the coalition other than <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. This activity was pursued
                            without any special authority and on <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss>’s initiative but with Ambassador <persName

                                >CIA</gloss> with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName> in Washington in mid-September 1969. The
                            Ambassador, while agreeing with its continuation, emphasized that the
                            role of the U.S. Government in the forthcoming elections should be that
                            of <hi rend="italic">not</hi> supporting any candidate because, among
                            other reasons, he felt that “we can’t get anyone elected.” At a separate

                                corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName> and his key people, <gloss

                            outlining what was being done in the covert action field about the

                            done. What <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> wished to avoid, it was
                            explained, was a sudden late request to support a specific candidate.

                                >Meyer</persName> was assured during this session that <gloss

                        <p>b. A series of discussions ensued with the Department of State on the
                            proposed status report. The major complication involved a proposal from
                            the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> Station Chief in Chile to
                            underwrite several more anti-<persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> activities which, if approved, could result in
                            side—or, even, more direct—political benefits accruing to Alessandri.
                            Ultimately, key personnel from the Department of State, from <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>, and the <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> Station Chief in Chile participated in
                            a round table meeting in mid-January 1970 at which time the Department
                            of State expressed its underlying concerns as a point of departure:</p>
                        <p>—The U.S. had been accused of being involved in a recent Chilean military
                            uprising.</p>
                        <p>—There was a particular sensitivity in Chile now about the <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>—The Chileans assumed that the U.S. Government was pro-Alessandri and
                            that any electoral intervention would redound to the benefit of
                            Alessandri.</p>
                        <p>—From the beginning the Department had questioned the need for the U.S.
                            Government to be involved in the election at all.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>’s position in
                            defense of the proposal was essentially that anything serving to keep
                            the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> forces split was
                            worthwhile despite the possibility of <hi rend="italic">some</hi>
                            political fall-out favoring Alessandri. The result was a proposal for
                            minimal action: intensification of the existent “spoiling” operation
                            with a firm caveat from the Department of State that strong
                            pro-Alessandri overtones developing among any of the covert mechanisms
                            would be cause for withdrawal of support forthwith. (This basic proposal
                            was approved by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s
                            special committee in March 1970. At the meeting, <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> noted that both Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss> Station Chief in Chile were concerned about a recent
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> surge and a

                            continued, support to a single candidate should be considered. In
                            response, Department of State said it would not favor support to
                            Alessandri.)</p>
                        <p>c. The Department of State did not waver in its position or attitude
                            throughout the electoral campaign; as a consequence, the limits within
                            which the covert action program functioned also remained the same
                            throughout the campaign.</p>

                                >Korry</persName> responded to the Department of State—regarding a
                            U.S. businessman’s proposal of U.S. Government support of Alessandri—in
                            these terms:</p>
                        <p>—“Thus I remain persuaded that it is to our benefit that we remain
                            uninvolved in the campaign of any aspirants to the Chilean Presidency
                            and to prolong the current total lack of any mention of the U.S. in the
                            campaign.”</p>
                        <p>—“Alessandri could use more money without any question. . . .
                            Alessandri’s camp includes the overwhelming majority of the high income
                            group . . . in a position to make contributions. . . . Reasonable
                            questions to ask are why they are not . . . and therefore why the U.S.G.
                            should seek to substitute for their lack of commitment and of national
                            interest.”</p>
                        <p>—“We have fewer and fewer tangible assets to employ to retain influence
                            but if the U.S.G. were to commit itself to an anti-<gloss

                            political party in Chile and the government could have very serious
                            consequences here.”</p>
                        <p>—“Conclusion: I would understand a theoretical case to help both
                            Alessandri and <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> to defeat
                            the Fidel Castroist <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and
                            to demonstrate a hedging U.S. sympathy to each. I cannot see any
                            theoretical advantage in helping one to fight the other with the
                            indirect benefits to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            particularly when such a commitment could not be ‘discreet’ and when
                            such U.S.G. intervention would lead to the further indirect ‘commitment’
                            to bail out the new government whenever it got into trouble. . . .”</p>
                        <p>b. In mid-June, a substantial expansion of the anti-<persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> covert action program was
                            advocated by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>
                            and the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> Station Chief. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> reiterated, however,
                            that his position remained “U.S. support of any candidate would be
                            counter-productive”. Department of State representatives in discussions
                            with <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> exhibited deep reservations
                            about this proposition because:</p>
                        <p>—The risk was greatly heightened.</p>
                        <p>—The pro-Alessandri cast was disturbing.</p>
                        <p>—Later it would be difficult to prove to the Christian Democrats that
                            this was not U.S. Government support of Alessandri should the Christian
                            Democrats win the presidential election.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> supported the proposal for an
                            expanded program and noted that it (<gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                            >CIA</gloss>) viewed the prospects of an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> government with considerable seriousness,
                            perhaps more seriously than did the Department. The Department outlined
                            its concerns to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>
                            in a cable reading in part:</p>
                        <p>“As you know, approval of the earlier, much smaller program was
                            conditioned on its not becoming a pro-Alessandri operation . . . to what
                            degree does proposed greatly augmented program increase risk of use of
                            our effort in behalf of Alessandri rather than against <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, with obvious disadvantages. .
                            . . We assume you would agree that, as in <pb n="208" facs="0248"
                                xml:id="pg_208"/>modest program, we would suspend expanded program
                            if it were to be used for Alessandri.”</p>
                        <p>c. In late June 1970, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>’s special committee approved the expanded
                            program. The principal Department of State representative present stated
                            that he harbored philosophic reservations about funding election
                            interventions and that Assistant Secretary of State <persName
                                corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName> and his principal deputy opposed
                            authorizing the current request. Shortly thereafter, Assistant Secretary
                            of State <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName> expressed the
                            Department’s viewpoint to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName> in a message which opened with the statements:</p>
                        <p>“So that you will have full background, I want you to know that we in
                                <gloss target="#t_ARA_1">ARA</gloss> and the Department as a whole
                            recommended against approval . . . of your proposal for political
                            action. . . . Among other considerations, we gave more weight to the
                            exposure potential, and less weight to the protective attractiveness of
                            being able to say ‘we had done something’. . . . We will be doing
                            something which Chileans, who have ample resources and a great stake in
                            the outcome, should themselves be doing. We also took into account . . .
                            the uncertain effectiveness of the effort: The probability that, from
                            the standpoint of our interests in Chile, all three candidates would be
                            negative sooner or later; and the certainty that exposure would destroy
                            any prospect of mitigating <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName>
                            or <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> post-election
                            attitudes.”</p>
                        <p>c. In the final two weeks of the campaign, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss> authorized a substantial infusion of funds for covert
                            activities requested by the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> Station
                            Chief in Chile. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> also arranged for
                            some $450,000 in funds from U.S. business interests to be passed to the
                            Alessandri camp during this period. This action was taken without
                            reference to the Department of State for obvious reasons.</p>

                        <p>a. By early 1970, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> had amassed an
                            array of covert action mechanisms in anticipation of a heavy role in the

                        <p>a. On 15 September 1970, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> was
                            directed to try to prevent Marxist <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Salvador
                                Allende</persName>’s ascent to the Chilean presidency on 3 November.
                            This effort was to be independent of concurrent endeavors being
                            undertaken through, or with the knowledge of, the 40 Committee,
                            Department of State, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName>.</p>
                        <p>b. Briefly, the situation at that time was the following:</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> had attained a plurality
                            of only some 40,000 in the Chilean popular vote for president. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ARJ_1">Jorge Alessandri</persName>, a conservative and
                            the runner-up, would face <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> in a Congressional run-off on 24 October. The
                            run-off winner would be invested as president on 3 November.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s designation as
                            president by Congress was very probable given all known factors in the
                            Chilean political equation.</p>
                        <p>—Given the dismal prospects of a political formula being worked out to
                            prevent <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s designation as
                            president by Congress, remaining alternatives centered around overcoming
                            the apolitical, constitutional-oriented inertia of the Chilean
                            military.</p>
                        <p>—U.S. Government intentions were highly suspect, particularly in
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and certain
                            government sectors. Suspicions extended to all Americans in Chile for
                            whatever declared purpose. In addition, the Chilean military were being
                            monitored quite closely by the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> forces for warning signals of any
                            interventionist proclivities.</p>

                        <p>a. A Chilean Task Force was assembled and functioning three days after
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> was assigned the mission. It
                            was headed by [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]
                            and highly-qualified <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> [<hi

                            specifically for <pb n="211" facs="0251" xml:id="pg_211"/>this purpose.
                            A special communications channel was set up simultaneously to Santiago,
                            Chile, and Buenos Aires, Argentina, to handle sensitive cable traffic
                            for the Task Force.</p>
                        <p>b. [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] It consisted of four
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> officers with the appearance,
                            language, and experience to sustain the fiction of various foreign
                            nationalities. They were recalled from their overseas posts to
                            Washington, briefed, and inserted individually into Chile [<hi

                            their only U.S. contact was a <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>

                        <p>c. By a special (and unique) arrangement requested by <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, the U.S. Army Attaché in Santiago was
                            placed under operational direction of the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss> Chief of Station there. His assistance and Chilean
                            military contacts were invaluable in this program.</p>

                            <hi rend="roman">3.</hi> The Dual Approach: Constitutional and Coup</p>
                        <p>a. Prospects for inducing Congress to vote for Alessandri rather than
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> were never bright
                            and, they all focused on inspiring a reluctant, indecisive President
                            Frei to assume an out-of-character role: dynamic leadership within his
                            own party, with the “persuadables” in Congress, and with the military.
                            Frei was under no illusions about Chile’s fate under an <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime. “Chile has a very
                            short future,” he said, “and after 4 November it will only have a
                            past.”</p>
                        <p>b. Initially, Frei was willing to consider and even advocate a
                            constitutional solution: the so-called Frei re-election gambit. The
                            question was whether he would be willing to commit his prestige
                            completely in following through on such a difficult political maneuver
                            with the outcome, at best, unassured. The basic gambit consisted of
                            marshalling enough Congressional votes to elect Alessandri over
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> with the
                            understanding Alessandri would resign immediately after inauguration and
                            pave the way for a special election in which Frei could legally become a
                            candidate. As a preliminary step, Frei coordinated Alessandri’s
                            post-election statement that if he were selected for the presidency by
                            Congress, he (Alessandri) would resign. The thrust of <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s endeavors, then, was to use every
                            plausible pressure combined with inducements to move Frei down this
                            path. To this end, virtually overnight <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss> mobilized an interlocking political action and
                            propaganda campaign designed both to goad and entice Frei into following
                            through on the re-election gambit.</p>
                        <p>c. At the same time, recognizing the fallibilities of Frei, <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> focused on provoking a military coup.
                            This undertaking was segregated from that of the Frei re-election gambit
                            with the intention that it be pur<pb n="212" facs="0252" xml:id="pg_212"

                            <hi rend="roman">4.</hi> Propaganda Campaign</p>
                        <p>a. The propaganda campaign was tailored to generating concern about
                            Chile’s future in terms which would condition the thinking <hi
                                rend="italic">and</hi> actions of the three key elements in the
                            Chilean political equation: Frei himself, the Chilean political elite,
                            and the Chilean military (the latter two of which could well bring
                            collateral influence to bear on Frei). Each of these elements had
                            hastened to rationalize its acceptance of an <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> presidency. Their palliative
                            was the built-in checks and balance of Chile’s demonstrated reverence
                            for democracy and constitutionality, sweetened by <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s promise to honor these
                            traditions.</p>
                        <p>b. After the 4 September popular vote, the world press had tended to
                            treat the prospect of witnessing the first freely-elected Marxist head
                            of state take office as a curious aberration of democracy rather than a
                            politically significant event. Press interest and coverage was
                            relatively light until the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> forces fortuitously provided an attractive issue
                            which could be exploited. By 15 September, it became apparent that
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> was conducting a
                            rather blatant campaign to intimidate the Chilean information media
                            through threats of assassination and violence, takeovers by so-called
                            worker organizations, and ultimatums to the management of newspapers and
                            radio stations. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            purpose was to smother any opposition to his election by Congress and to
                            take advantage of that peculiarly Latin, and pronounced Chilean,
                            propensity to jump on an accelerating bandwagon—ideals and the country’s
                            welfare to the contrary. A major target of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> was “El Mercurio”, the most prestigious
                            newspaper in Chile and the major opposition voice to <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> up to that time. <gloss

                                >Allende</persName> brazenly taking his first step in “communizing”
                            Chile by attacking freedom of the press and, worse, with the election
                            still unsettled. Covert action resources were used to launch:</p>

                            for on-the-scene reporting. (By 28 September, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss> had in place in, or enroute to, Chile 15 journalist
                            agents from 10 different countries. This cadre was supplemented by 8

                        <p>As a result of the ensuing furore, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>—sensitive to world opinion and attempting to

                            become more circumspect. By 25 September, heavy-handed intimidation of
                            the press had virtually ceased.</p>
                        <p>c. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s show of strength had
                            made its point however; the Chilean press, including “El Mercurio”,
                            never did regain its resiliency and remained thoroughly muted from

                            own resources:</p>

                        <p>—placement of individual news items through agents against the resistance
                            of a cowed management;</p>
                        <p>—financing of a new, albeit small, newspaper;</p>
                        <p>—subsidy of an anti-<persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            political group and its radio programs, political advertisements, and
                            political rallies; and,</p>
                        <p>—direct mailing of foreign news articles to President Frei, Mrs. Frei,
                            selected military leaders, and the Chilean domestic press.</p>
                        <p>This effort did not, and could not, replace a Chilean press, fully
                            operative and free of restraint. Virtually alone, it did keep the voice
                            of public opposition alive inside Chile for coup purposes during the
                            final weeks of this period.</p>
                        <p>d. The magnitude of the propaganda campaign mounted during this six week
                            period in the Latin American and European media—aside from the U.S., the
                            two “outside” areas with, by far, the greatest influence on Chile—is
                            evident from the fact that only <hi rend="italic">partial</hi> returns
                            show 726 articles, broadcasts, editorials, and similar items as a direct
                            result of agent activity. Just how many of these items were replayed is
                            not known [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>]. Nor, has
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> any idea of the scope of the
                            immeasurable multiplier effect—that is, how much its “induced” news
                            focused media interest on the Chilean issues and stimulated additional
                            coverage—except that, even by conservative standards, this contribution
                            must have been both substantial and significant.</p>
                        <p>e. Special intelligence and “inside” briefings were given to U.S.
                            journalists in deference to the international influence of the U.S.

                                >CIA</gloss>. The <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> correspondent in Chile
                            who was providing much of the background material for the story
                            apparently accepted <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s

                        <p>a. The political action program had only one purpose: to induce President

                                >Allende</persName> from taking office on 3 November. Realistically,
                            the task was one of attempting to recast Frei, as a political
                            personality, in a role demanding decisiveness and “machismo” to a degree
                            that, thus far, had eluded him. Pressures from those whose opinion
                            and/or approval he valued—in combination with adequate propaganda
                            orchestrations—represented the only hope of converting Frei.</p>

                            Christian Democratic movement as well as the Catholic Church were
                            prompted to visit Frei or send personal messages to him urging that he
                            save Chile. Some of these endeavors were the following:</p>

                        <p>—The West German Christian Democratic Party—which enjoyed special

                            Democrats in Chile over a range of many years—dispatched several
                            top-level emissaries to Chile. They contacted Frei and other Christian

                        <p>—[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] one of the international
                            figures in Catholicism most respected by Frei, sent a personal message
                            indicating that Frei and his party must oppose Marxism.</p>
                        <p>—[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] of the Italian Christian
                            Democratic Party—which had good fraternal relations with Frei and his
                            party—refused to intervene. (He said it was a hopeless situation and he
                            saw no point in risking his reputation in a lost cause.)</p>
                        <p>Collateral efforts were made to influence Frei or those close to Frei,

                        <p>—Telegrams were sent Mrs. Frei from women’s groups in other Latin
                            American countries.</p>
                        <p>—Foreign press items were mailed directly to Frei, Mrs. Frei, and
                            Christian Democratic Congressmen in Chile.</p>
                        <p>—Intelligence was surfaced indicating that, once in power, the Communists
                            intended to denigrate Frei as the first step in the dissolution of his
                            party.</p>
                        <p>d. In spite of everything, Frei never asserted himself. Indeed, he failed
                            to attend or to influence otherwise the 3–4 October Congress of his
                            party at which time it was decided by a substantial margin to make a
                            deal with <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. With that
                            decision, the Frei re-election gambit died and constitutional
                            alternatives had been exhausted. Subsequently, Frei did manage to
                            confide to several top-ranking military officers that he would not
                            oppose a coup, with a guarded implication he might even welcome one.
                            Yet, when a coup opportunity and situation presented itself upon the
                            assassination of Army Commander in Chief <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1"
                                >Schneider</persName>, Frei moved quickly away from it.</p>

                        <p>a. After early October—absent any evidence that Frei was responding,
                            politically speaking, to artificial respiration—a military coup
                            increasingly suggested itself as the only possible solution to the

                            exist in the military and the Carabineros, but were immobilized by:</p>

                            strict adherence to the Constitution;</p>
                        <p>—fear of the reaction of non-commissioned officers who tended to harbor
                                pro-<persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> sympathies;
                            and,</p>

                                >Allende</persName> blandishments to the effect that the military

                        <p>Although individual officers among the top leadership of the military and
                            Carabineros were pre-disposed to take action, they felt the Army was

                            several “illegals” at different points of negotiation with him. He
                            requested a sizeable airdrop of arms and ammunition in the countryside
                            (which was denied as unrealistic under the circumstances), substantial

                            was agreed upon), and paralyzing gas grenades (which were not
                            immediately available). Finally, it became evident that <persName

                            support to carry out a successful coup, but might trigger prematurely an
                            action that would spoil the better chances of doing so from within the
                            active duty military itself. Direct contact was suspended and an

                        <p>—most of Frei’s cabinet would resign and be replaced by military and

                        <p>—Frei would renounce the presidency and leave the country; and,</p>
                        <p>—a military junta would be installed.</p>
                        <p>Indications were that Frei was aware of the main elements of this plan as
                            were a few cabinet members. The only assistance requested by <persName

                            through <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName>’s abduction
                            was several sub-machineguns, ammunition, a few tear gas grenades, and
                            gas masks (all of which were provided) plus $50,000 for expenses (which
                            was ready to be passed upon demand).</p>
                        <p>f. On 22 October, General <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1"
                                >Schneider</persName> was mortally wounded on his way to work.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_PGC_1">Prats</persName> was appointed to
                            command the Army in place of <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1"
                                >Schneider</persName>. Frei made a strong statement denouncing the
                            assassination and declared a state of emergency; as a result thereof,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_VGC_1">Valenzuela</persName> assumed
                            control of the Santiago area. In effect, the military were in control of
                            Chile and in an excellent position to follow through with a successful
                            coup irrespective of Frei’s actions or inactions. They did not—probably
                            because of the strong reaction of Frei and the public to the <persName
                                corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName> affair and lack of any
                            positive encouragement from Frei. Their rationale is not certain at this
                            stage, nor, for that matter, is it certain who or what group was
                            ultimately responsible for <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1"
                                >Schneider</persName>’s assassination. The <persName

                            not and that all matériel passed to it is still in its possession
                            unused. In any event, the opportunity for a coup soon passed; and,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> was easily elected
                            by Congress on 24 October and quietly inaugurated on 3 November.</p>

                            the background of why more energetic measures were not taken by the U.S.
                            Government to prevent <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            election in Chile. The report was drawn from all levels of <gloss

                            summary of the report is at Tab A, but I think you will find it worth
                            reading in full.</p>
                        <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_HR_1">Helms</persName>’ report is somewhat
                                selective—<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> had reservations
                            itself about the feasibility and risks involved in expanding covert
                            operations in Chile—its implications are significant. The report
                            indicates that:</p>
                        <p>—As the election drew nearer, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName> was prepared to support some expansion of the

                            program, but not in any way which would jeopardize our ties with the
                            Christian Democratic Party which he saw as the only viable non-Communist
                            political force in Chile.</p>
                        <p>—Throughout the pre-election period, the State Department had
                            reservations about any expansion of the covert action program, and was
                            completely opposed to considering any support for the conservative
                            candidate, Alessandri.</p>
                        <p>—As a result, the State Department established a restrictive criterion
                            that any covert anti-<persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            operations must not involve support for Alessandri.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The net effect of the State Department’s position was
                                that nothing could be done to stop <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> if it meant strengthening Alessandri.</hi>
                            In view of the fact that the election came down to a very close race
                            between <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and Alessandri,

                                >Tomic</persName> trailing far behind, the State position against
                            strengthening Alessandri neutralized us. <pb n="219" facs="0259"
                                xml:id="pg_219"/>While it is not certain that a less circumscribed
                            covert action program would have given the marginal victory to
                            Alessandri, <persName corresp="#p_HR_1">Helms</persName> feels the odds
                            for success of an expanded program would have been reasonably favorable.
                            An Alessandri victory might have presented some problems for us, but it
                            clearly would not have been as threatening to our interests as <persName

                        <p>The possibility of an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            victory was apparent as far back as 1968. <hi rend="italic">A limited

                            apparent even then that the Chilean Congress probably would decide the
                            Presidential election. The covert action mechanism used at that time was

                                    Media Under a Marxist Regime,” outlined the various types of
                                    media in Chile and the corresponding political connections of
                                    each. Although there were a number of opposition media outlets
                                    in Chile after <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                                    took power, the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> report was
                                    pessimistic that the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                        >Allende</persName> regime would continue to allow an

                        <p>1. Attached for your information is a paper entitled “Chilean Media under
                            a Marxist Regime” which describes the influence of the Popular Unity
                                (<gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>) coalition in Chilean media
                            prior to and following the inauguration of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Salvador Allende</persName> as President of Chile.</p>
                        <p>2. This paper, which was requested by the Chairman of the Committee,
                            reflects the views of both our Station in Santiago and the local <gloss
                                target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> office and the Embassy. The gist of
                            the report is that Popular Unity political and economic pressures and a
                            related decrease in advertising revenue are forcing a major portion of
                            Chilean mass communications media towards receivership and ultimate
                                <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> control. However, note is taken
                            in conclusion that some newspapers and radio stations directly
                            associated with opposition political parties are continuing to wage an
                            aggressive anti-Communist campaign and merit encouragement and
                            support.</p>

                            <p>1. The Chilean media complex includes over 190 daily newspapers (12
                                in Santiago); approximately 140 radio stations (29 in Santiago); a
                                national, government-controlled TV network plus three university
                                owned and operated channels; and magazine, textbook, and other
                                publishing companies. This complex has been financed primarily by
                                commercial advertising, which has decreased dramatically since

                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s election as
                                President of Chile. Its ability to maintain any substantive freedom
                                of expression under the new Marxist government appears dubious.</p>
                            <p>2. The Popular Unity (<gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>) coalition
                                which backed <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                                successful bid for the Presidency controlled a substantial segment
                                of this media complex even before the popular elections of 4
                                September 1970. Much of this Marxist influence among media began in
                                the School of Journalism at the University of Chile, whose graduates
                                control the Colegio de Periodistas (Journalists’ Union). Another
                                source of Marxist leverage was their control of various key radio
                                unions, including the Radio Broadcasters’ Union (estimated 80%
                                controlled), Radio Journalists’ Union (estimated 90% controlled) and
                                the Radio Operators Union (estimated 80% controlled). Control of
                                these key unions enabled the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> to
                                exert pressure on vocal non-Marxists in the media field and to
                                create <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> media workers’ committees
                                at the working level in media owned by the anti-Marxist right. Prior
                                to the election the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> Parties had
                                direct control over some outlets, such as the Socialist Party’s <hi

                                    rend="italic">El Siglo</hi>, and <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                    >UP</gloss> supporters directed the programming of media such as
                                the University of Chile’s television Channel 9 and Radio IEM,
                                Catholic University’s Channel 13 in Santiago and Channel 4 in
                                Valparaiso, and State Technical University’s Radio UTE. The <gloss
                                    target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> could also count on the assistance
                                of other ostensibly non-<gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> organs
                                such as <hi rend="italic">Clarin</hi>, the largest mass circulation
                                daily. But the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>’s greatest
                                strength lay in the heavy concentration of <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                    >UP</gloss> supporters at the grass-roots level.</p>
                            <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> electoral program included
                                a vaguely defined promise to turn all media outlets into workers
                                cooperatives. Immediately after the election, on 9 September,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> stated that
                                “ownership and direction of communications media should be turned
                                over to workers in the media.” Concurrently, the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> began a campaign to gain control of
                                key opposition media organs in order to “prevent right-wing
                                maneuvers to steal the elections.” Journalists and newscasters who
                                refused to support <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                                were threatened with assassination and other forms of physical
                                violence; <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> leaders such as
                                Communist Deputy Jorge Inzunza delivered ultimatums to radio
                                stations demanding placement of station newsrooms under <gloss
                                    target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> management and the assignment of
                                    <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> staff members as news and
                                political commentators; non-Marxist newspapers were told to choose
                                between supporting <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                                and being taken over by workers cooperatives. This bullying was
                                short-lived, however, and was less important than long-term
                                infiltration and growing <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>
                                influence from the working level upwards. The emergence of a <gloss

                                to permit leftist forces to consolidate influence and control over a

                                been all too willing to fall <pb n="223" facs="0263" xml:id="pg_223"

                                consolidated its control over numerous key radio stations, including
                                the Radio Portales network which has the highest listenership in the
                                country. It also assumed control of the government-owned daily <hi
                                    rend="italic">La Nacion</hi> and the government-owned national
                                television network on inauguration day.</p>
                            <p>4. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government has
                                not spelled out its media policy in detail. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has not followed through
                                on his harsh campaign threats against the media which opposed him
                                and has announced his intention to take action only against those
                                media which follow a “seditious” line. The plan to turn media
                                outlets into workers cooperatives appears to have been shelved for
                                the time being in view of the complex financial and managerial
                                problems such a transformation would entail. <gloss
                                    target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> financiers have expanded their
                                media holdings since the election in an effort to counterbalance
                                    <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> domination of the media
                                field, particularly radio, which is the most effective mass medium
                                in Chile and is regarded by the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>
                                as the most effective tool available for transforming Chilean
                                society. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> will
                                probably try to avoid repressive action which would tarnish his
                                “democratic image” at home and abroad.</p>
                            <p>5. Nevertheless the outlook for non-Marxist Chilean media is bleak. A
                                sizable portion of the industry could be wiped out if advertising
                                revenue falls below operating costs. All media are therefore
                                susceptible to pressures exerted by <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                    >UP</gloss> members holding patronage positions in the
                                ministries concerned with labor, taxation and social security, and
                                there are recent indications that such pressures are already being
                                brought to bear on newspapers under <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                    >PDC</gloss> control. For instance, government internal revenue
                                inspectors are pressuring Chilean businessmen not to advertise in
                                    <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> media and the
                                Communist-controlled union at Zig-Zag, a <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                    >PDC</gloss>-controlled publishing company, went on strike from
                                6 November to 4 December in an apparent attempt to force Zig-Zag
                                into government receivership. These pressures, plus the voluntary
                                transformation of media content and stress which has been evident
                                for some time in many outlets which formerly opposed <persName

                                    target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> is likely to be successful in
                                establishing control of the Chilean media complex without resorting
                                to drastic measures or openly repressive action.</p>
                            <p>Media organs clearly associated with opposition parties remain as
                                independent voices. Particularly noteworthy are <gloss

                                    >La Prensa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pueblo Libre</hi>, both of
                                which are following strong anti-Communist lines and are enjoying a

                                while Radio Cooperativa, which supported Allesandri’s campaign, is
                                virtually apolitical but still carries one anti-Communist
                                commentator. All opposition outlets will clearly need encouragement
                                and support.</p>

                        <p>1. There is, as yet, little hard intelligence that Chile is actively
                            supporting guerrilla activities in Latin America. The <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government since it took
                            office on 3 November 1970 has been preoccupied with consolidating its
                            own position. Its existence, however, has improved the prospects for
                            subversive activity in nearby countries.</p>
                        <p>2. The new Chilean government is in a position to aid significantly
                            insurgent movements against the governments of other Latin American
                            countries. Allowing these groups to train, organize, and otherwise use
                            Chile as a base or safe-haven is one possibility. Facilitation of travel
                            by documentation or providing access to arms, medical care, or funds are
                            others. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> reportedly has
                            warned Chilean groups supporting Latin American insurgents that they
                            must operate clandestinely in order to avoid the risk of retaliation,

                            Foreign Ministry might also be used to facilitate activities of
                            subversive groups.</p>

                            Soviets will probably attempt to influence Cuban activity in Chile to
                            fit Soviet strategy. They will have the aid of the Communist Party of

                            This aspect of the situation was made manifest in 1968 when, after the

                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> assisted the three

                        <p>3. In January 1970 the Cuban press reported that <persName

                            the unity of the Latin American revolutionary process while appearing on
                            a Chilean “Meet the Press” television program in November 1970. Among
                            other statements pertaining to guerrilla warfare, he said: “I would say
                            categorically that our frequently presented revolutionary position that
                            armed struggle is the basis for revolutionary development in Latin

                                >Allende</persName> are unlikely to interfere. Several may be

                            tradition of political asylum is a hallowed one in Latin America, and
                            Mexican embassies for many years have been the goal of political
                            refugees. The Chilean Embassy in Paraguay now has three asylees who took

                            Such moves will offer new opportunities for agitation against the US
                            among other Latin American countries, without the pitfalls of direct

                            latter’s unique position of acceptability in pro-Moscow, pro-Havana, and

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">G. Estimate of Soviet Role in Chile</p>
                        <p>1. The Soviets are primarily interested in assuring that the Chilean
                            Marxist experience works and that it be an attractive example to other
                            Latin American Marxist movements. Latin American Communists traveling in
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> are being asked by the
                            Soviets to return home via Chile in order to contact the <gloss
                                target="#t_PCCh_1">PCCh</gloss> to find out what their respective
                            parties can do to help the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> government. Should this objective be achieved it
                            would be particularly significant in that the Christian Democrat
                            experience under President Frei, and clearly supported by the United
                            States Government, failed. The Soviets would expect economic and
                            political gains to be made under the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> government.</p>
                        <p>2. The Soviets can be expected to exploit the Chilean situation to the
                            maximum as far as using it for propaganda to the rest of Latin America
                            and in other underdeveloped areas, to stimulate an increase in the
                            volume of trade with Chile, to expand Soviet activities such as Aeroflot
                            and Soviet shipping lines, to establish “weather stations” or “Antarctic
                            exploration stations” on Chilean territory or with Chile’s aid, to
                            increase greatly the exchange of students to and from the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, to use Chileans as a wedge into
                            more and more Latin American organizations, such as trade union
                            organizations. The Soviets will undoubtedly try to avoid any clear
                            appearance of military involvement or exploitation of Chile. For this
                            reason they will probably not supply any significant amount of weapons
                            to Chile at this time.</p>
                        <p>3. The Soviets, therefore, will do what they can to contribute to the
                            success of the Chilean experiment. This support might well take the form
                            of extending credits, supporting Chile’s internal and foreign policies,
                            sending technical, scientific, and military advisors but the Soviets
                            will be careful not to extend themselves where they could be put in a
                            position of being responsible—at least in the beginning—for the outcome
                            of the Chilean experiment. The Soviets will not be ready to assume major
                            costs or risks to bail out Chile if a crisis occurs, such as a military
                            invasion of Chile by the Argentines. The Soviets will, in all
                            probability, seek to avoid a crisis developing. Some problems may be <pb

                            remain clandestine and covert. The <gloss target="#t_RIS_1">RIS</gloss>
                            will not be visible in the arrest of “reactionaries” or the
                            establishment of controls over the population. This will be carried out
                            entirely by Chileans. It is probable that to the extent that it is
                            consulted at all, the <gloss target="#t_RIS_1">RIS</gloss> will counsel
                            caution and act as a guide for Chilean security service expansion and

                            will encourage all possible efforts to “unmask” <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"

                            against the new government as a means of justifying tighter controls and
                            in order to lessen U.S. influence in general. The total number of <gloss
                                target="#t_RIS_1">RIS</gloss> officers in Chile will increase slowly
                            and steadily. The <gloss target="#t_RIS_1">RIS</gloss> will look for all
                            possible ways to blacken the name of <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss> and the U.S., including thrusting the blame on <gloss

                            other violent acts which may occur against the new government.</p>
                        <p>6. The principal effort of the <gloss target="#t_RIS_1">RIS</gloss> in
                            Chile over the next few years will be to utilize various types of
                            contacts, collaborators, penetrations, and agents to influence at the
                            highest level possible key figures within the Chilean government. The
                                <gloss target="#t_RIS_1">RIS</gloss> can be expected to conduct and
                            plan discreet political action operations. The <gloss target="#t_RIS_1"
                                >RIS</gloss> will seek to exploit and develop new agents of
                            influence and agents of importance to assure that the Marxist victory of
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> remains a victory
                            and sets the stage for similar political developments in Latin America.
                            To the degree possible the Soviets will attempt to influence Cuban
                            activity in Chile; some competition will exist as it has in other areas,
                            but the Soviets have surely placed a high priority in Chile and
                            internecine warfare with <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel

                            in Latin America is likely to be enhanced if the Chilean experiment is
                            successful from the Cuban/Soviet point of view.</p>

                                <p>Summary: This memorandum transmitted the paper titled “Options
                                    for the United States in the Event of Expropriation of U.S.
                                    Business Interests by Chile,” for consideration by the Senior
                                    Review Group. The paper stressed that the chances for
                                    expropriation of the mining and metal processing industries were
                                    high and outlined various strategies the United States could
                                    employ in the event.</p>

                            OF U.S. BUSINESS INTERESTS BY CHILE</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                            <hi rend="roman">I.</hi> Prospects for Expropriation</p>
                        <p>The book value of U.S. direct investment in Chile is approximately $800
                            million, more than half in mining and metal processing. Replacement
                            value is, of course, much higher. The largest single components are
                            Anaconda’s and Kennecott’s 49% participation in mixed companies which
                            account for the bulk of Chile’s copper production. (The agreement under
                            which Anaconda transferred 51% ownership to the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> in 1969 also requires the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> to acquire the remaining 49% by 1982 under an agreed
                            compensation formula.) There are numerous other enterprises wholly or
                            partly owned in the U.S. in extractive, manufacturing or service
                            industries, and in commerce.</p>
                        <pb n="231" facs="0271" xml:id="pg_231"/>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> liability under investment
                            insurance against expropriation could be $310 million. Present cash
                            reserves to meet that and all other investment insurance liabilities
                            worldwide are $86 million. These reserves have been growing with annual
                            premiums which last year amounted to $20 million. Claims require a year
                            to ripen from the dates of the individual expropriations. Still,
                            wide-spread expropriation of U.S. interests would exhaust the reserves
                            and require the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to seek further
                            appropriations from Congress for these losses.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> has set itself on an
                            irreversible course toward expropriation of a very substantial part of
                            the U.S. investment, beginning with the large copper mining
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>There is a wide range of ways in which the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> could carry out its takings. There could be sweeping
                            seizures of enterprises by category, or there could be case-by-case
                            negotiations. There could be takings with little or no satisfactory
                            provision for compensation, or there could be reasonable assurance of
                            it, whether by law or regulation, by Executive promise, by establishment
                            of favorable judicial or administrative precedent, or by willingness to
                            have serious negotiations with the owners. There could be adherence to
                            clear and predictable procedures, or resort to devices and subterfuges
                            such as introducing counterclaims, however implausible, to wash out
                            compensation, as in the <gloss target="#t_IPC_1">IPC</gloss> case in
                            Peru. The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> could help labor disputes
                            and other kinds of demands against company managements turn into
                            pressures for expropriation, it could try to hinder this kind of
                            development, or it could take a hands-off attitude. Expropriations could
                            take place in low key, or could be staged as Roman circuses for
                            propaganda effect. The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> could carry
                            them out with a show of impartiality, or it could openly discriminate
                            against U.S. owners in extent of property taken or the treatment given,
                            or both.</p>
                        <p>All these contrasting modes of action could have in-between gradations,
                            and the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> could employ every variety
                            of mix among them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> expropriations will probably begin
                            soon, perhaps within the coming weeks. There are signs that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> is already behind its original
                            schedule, probably because of delays in getting agreement within the
                                <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> coalition on the expropriation
                            measures now being drawn up. The most obvious sign is the non-appearance
                            in the Congress of expropriation legislation which <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> publicly promised for the
                            first week of December, and then for the second week.</p>
                        <p>At this moment there are no actual expropriations of U.S.-owned
                            properties in train, but “interventions” under Chilean labor laws have
                            taken place in three enterprises partly or wholly owned by U.S.
                            citizens. In these cases court appointed “interventors” have taken
                            either full or supervisory management control. The chances appear to be
                            even or better in two of the cases (NIBSA, a brass fabricating plant
                            half <pb n="232" facs="0272" xml:id="pg_232"/>owned by the Northern
                            Indiana Brass Co.; and the 60% U.S.-owned Ralston Purina chicken and
                            feed producing plant) that the owners will be unable to recover control
                            of management, and the situation is likely to lead to expropriation.</p>
                        <p>There is a triple impetus behind the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                            movement toward its expropriation program; its ideological thrust; its
                            desire for the political rewards of striking at the foreign-exploiter
                            symbol (expropriation of the copper holdings especially has an appeal in
                            Chile extending well beyond Marxist sectors); and its eagerness to gain
                            access to current copper (and other) earnings to ease its heavy budget
                            pressures.</p>
                        <p>There are also inhibitions on the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>.
                            First and foremost is its announced—and evident—desire to retain
                            international respectability and, more importantly in the short range,
                            to retain credit-worthiness in the Western lending community.</p>
                        <p>Less important inhibitions would include difficulties of finding
                            managerial and technical talent to run the enterprises for the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and the converse consideration of
                            possible encouragement of further damaging emigration of this kind of
                            talent under an expropriation program.</p>
                        <p>The statements and actions of the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> in
                            its first month in power, coupled with the known attitudes and
                            intentions of coalition <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> leaders over
                            recent years, warrant the following net judgment: The <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> will certainly move shortly to
                            expropriate U.S. properties. The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                            will probably make dispositions, especially on compensation, which will
                            result in little or no prompt dollar payments to claimants but which
                            will enable the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> to make strong
                            propaganda claims of legality and justice in its treatment of the
                            foreign interests concerned. In the likely event that it will pay in
                            local currency or bonds over long periods, it will play heavily on
                            nationalistic themes of sovereignty and dignity. If, as is probable, it
                            reduces amounts of claims on grounds of plundered patrimony, tax
                            evasions and other malfeasances asserted in support of counterclaims, it
                            will add to the “anti-imperialist” theme the counterpoint of betrayal of
                            Chile by previous anti-patriotic administrations.</p>
                        <p>In any case, Chilean expropriatory acts and our response will be the
                            single greatest determinant of the course of U.S.-Chilean relations. The
                            repercussions will be significant within Chile and in other countries in
                            Latin America.</p>

                                provision is made for the payment of prompt, adequate and effective

                            exchange equivalent to the full value thereof. Such suspension is to

                            property owned by U.S. citizens or by entities 50% owned by U.S.

                        <p>(b) repudiation of agreements with such U.S. citizens or entities;

                        <p>The statute does not require that compensation be paid, or even that a
                            firm agreement be concluded, within the six-month period. It does
                            require that “appropriate steps” be undertaken within that period. The
                            suspension is mandatory and may not be waived by the President, but the
                            Executive Branch makes the determination whether “appropriate steps” are
                            being taken. Appropriate steps could include good faith negotiations,
                            international arbitration, or even local judicial remedies when those
                            remedies are adequate and sufficiently speedy. The U.S. investor would
                            not be expected to exhaust local judicial remedies that are manifestly
                            inadequate.</p>

                            the President does not find such action contrary to the national
                            security (Section 620(c), <gloss target="#t_FAA_1">FAA</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>No monetary assistance is to be provided under the <gloss

                            requirements concerning <gloss target="#t_IBRD_1">IBRD</gloss> loans in
                            these circumstances, but the <gloss target="#t_IBRD_1">IBRD</gloss>
                            itself has adopted a policy of withholding loans in situation in which
                            uncompensated expropriations have taken place and reasonable steps are
                            not being taken toward the solution of the problem.</p>
                        <p>C. <hi rend="italic">Other Specific Considerations</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Investment Guaranties. Because of our great exposure under investment
                            guaranties in force in Chile, the handling of the expropriation issue
                            will be of great importance to the viability of the guaranty program and
                            of <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss> itself, and to the promotion
                            of private investment as a means of development.</p>
                        <pb n="235" facs="0275" xml:id="pg_235"/>
                        <p>2. Chilean Debt to the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. The Chilean
                            position on its debt to the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, which
                            exceeds $983 million, will be affected as the expropriation
                            action-reaction scenario unfolds. Of this, $176 million is owed to
                            Eximbank by the copper companies.</p>
                        <p>3. Vulnerability of the Chilean Economy to U.S. Measures and to Decline
                            in Foreign Investment. Pending the findings of a detailed study now
                            under way, a summary judgment here is that the range of measures
                            available to the U.S. for reprisal against Chile and the presumed drop
                            in investment from non-U.S. sources that would result from expropriation
                            would create serious problems for the Chilean economy but would not
                            cripple it.</p>
                        <p>4. Resort to Soviet and Communist Chinese Assistance. Although <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has professed a desire not to
                            become dependent on any single foreign power, and although the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China would probably
                            be very reluctant to assume large assistance burdens, the chances are
                            considerably better than even that, in response to U.S. retaliatory
                            measures, Chile would draw closer to the Communist powers.</p>
                        <p>5. Internal Political Effects. Given (a) the widespread acceptance within
                            the Chilean public of expropriation of foreign properties, especially
                            copper companies, as a legitimate national act; (b) probable
                            indifference by many non-Marxists to the principle of compensation; and
                            (c) probable <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> “fuzzing-up” of the
                            compensation question, the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> Government would have a good base for rallying
                            popular support to itself in the face of U.S. counteraction. The degree
                            of success would depend in considerable part on the nature and pace of
                            other internal measures <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            would have instituted prior to expropriation and on the circumstances
                            under which the U.S.-Chilean confrontation on expropriation had
                            occurred.</p>
                        <p>6. Effects on other U.S. Holdings in Chile. The prospects for any
                            significant U.S. property in Chile are not bright in any event, but the
                            application by the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> of retaliatory
                            measures against the initial expropriations would almost certainly
                            accelerate the pace of other takings.</p>
                        <p>7. Effects on U.S. Holdings in Latin America. The application or
                            withholding of <persName corresp="#p_HBB_1">Hickenlooper</persName> and
                            other sanctions would probably not be determining with respect to the
                            actions of other governments toward U.S. properties. The chances are
                            that each government would be guided by its own economic and political
                            needs.</p>
                        <p>8. Political Effects in Latin America. Latin American reaction will
                            depend greatly on how the Chilean situation evolves and on the
                            circumstances existing at the time the U.S. makes its moves.</p>
                        <p>Strong U.S. initiatives to apply <persName corresp="#p_HBB_1"
                                >Hickenlooper</persName> Amendment provisions to Chile would touch
                            widespread sensitivities in Latin America and arouse in some sectors
                            considerable sympathy for Chile. Many Latin Americans believe that the
                            application of the <persName corresp="#p_HBB_1">Hickenlooper</persName>
                            <pb n="236" facs="0276" xml:id="pg_236"/>Amendment would be in violation
                            of Article 19 of the Charter of the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1"
                            >OAS</gloss>, which prohibits member states from carrying out measures
                            of economic coercion against other members. However, the Marxist and
                            avowedly anti-U.S. nature of the Chilean regime would dilute sympathy
                            for that country in comparison with the potential in the case of a
                            country such as Peru.</p>
                        <p>If the U.S. approach were one of restraint, showing that Chile was
                            forcing us into the measures we were taking, there would be
                            significantly less adverse political reaction to us throughout Latin
                            America.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, failure by the U.S. to act would be interpreted in
                            other Latin American sectors, especially among conservatives, as a sign
                            of weakness.</p>
                        <p>9. Effects on our posture toward Peru. Application of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_HBB_1">Hickenlooper</persName> Amendment to Chile could,
                            depending on circumstances at the time, raise questions on our not
                            having applied it to Peru, and call for some justification.</p>

                            grants, suspend <gloss target="#t_PL_1">PL</gloss> 480 and military

                            Amendment, without waiting out the six months period, as soon as
                            plausible grounds are available for concluding that a reasonable period
                            of time has elapsed without the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                            taking “appropriate steps” to discharge international obligations.</p>
                        <p>Advantages.</p>
                        <p>—It would give the most forceful signal on the seriousness of the
                            consequences of expropriation actions.</p>
                        <p>—It would stop at an early date disbursements of uncommitted balances in
                            the assistance pipeline—now $19 million for <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss> and $41 million for Eximbank.</p>
                        <p>Disadvantages.</p>
                        <p>—It would coalesce support for the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> regime in Chile and elsewhere in Latin America.
                            (Option 1(b) would intensify the anti-U.S. reaction without providing an
                            argument credible to the Latin Americans that the U.S. action was
                            required by law.)</p>
                        <p>—It would destroy chances for obtaining compensation of expropriated

                                n="237" facs="0277" xml:id="pg_237"/>ment guaranty agreements;
                            stimulate Chile to make further uncompensated expropriations, and invite
                            repudiation of the $983 million debt owed to the U.S. Government.</p>
                        <p>—It would prejudice the U.S. position that suspension of assistance is
                            not economic coercion within the meaning of Article 19 of the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> Charter.</p>
                        <p>—It would create serious difficulties for us with the <gloss
                                target="#t_IDB_1">IDB</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IBRD_1"
                                >IBRD</gloss>, which would probably regard our action as premature
                            and unreasonable.</p>
                        <p>Option 2. Refrain from applying the <persName corresp="#p_HBB_1"
                                >Hickenlooper</persName> Amendment until the six-month period runs
                            out; take no initiatives to talk with the Chilean Government nor to give
                            guidance to U.S. companies affected. During this period we would
                            continue and intensify present economic restrictions on Chile,
                            approaching as rapidly as can be done in a non-overt way the <hi
                                rend="italic">de facto</hi> application of <persName
                                corresp="#p_HBB_1">Hickenlooper</persName> Amendment sanctions.</p>
                        <p>Advantages.</p>
                        <p>—It would avoid reactions based on prematurity of U.S. action under
                            Option 1, and allow time for clarification of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> position which could reinforce the
                            U.S. position as the injured party.</p>
                        <p>—It would afford U.S. investors some time to work out settlements that
                            would cut their losses and those of the U.S. Treasury.</p>
                        <p>—It would minimize U.S. involvement in complex expropriation compensation
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Disadvantages.</p>
                        <p>—Deferral of sanctions would permit pipeline funds to continue to flow to
                            Chile.</p>
                        <p>—Application of sanctions in six months, particularly if done overtly at
                            one point in time, would permit the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                            to use U.S. “intervention” as an issue to rally support at home and
                            elsewhere in Latin America.</p>
                        <p>—Failure to encourage negotiated settlements or recourse to third party
                            settlement would prejudice the interests of U.S. investors and the U.S.
                            Treasury and weaken U.S. arguments that the application of sanctions
                            does not violate Article 19 of the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>
                            Charter.</p>
                        <p>Option 3. Use the six months waiting period provided in the <persName
                                corresp="#p_HBB_1">Hickenlooper</persName> Amendment to try to work
                            out expropriation settlements, taking the approach that ambiguities in
                            compensation provisions are worth exploration in direct talks with the
                            Chilean Government. We would take steps to insure that the Chilean
                            Government had as soon as possible a clear understanding of our position
                            on expropriation and compensation. We would meanwhile urge the U.S.
                            companies affected to exhaust all meaningful local remedies. We would
                            continue to apply but not go beyond the present economic restrictions
                            against Chile. We would be prepared to consider relaxation of these
                            restrictions, depending on Chilean responses and the outlook for
                            obtaining results fa<pb n="238" facs="0278" xml:id="pg_238"/>vorable to
                            us. (This would require modification of present guidance on U.S. policy
                            toward Chile.)</p>
                        <p>Advantages.</p>
                        <p>—It would maximize the possibility of avoiding a confrontation which
                            would enable the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime
                            to gain support at home and elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>—It would be consonant with a cool but correct posture toward Chile.</p>
                        <p>—It would strengthen the U.S. legal basis for application of sanctions by
                            putting the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> in the position of
                            rejecting our proposals for settlement.</p>
                        <p>Disadvantages.</p>
                        <p>—It would continue disbursements under existing obligations.</p>
                        <p>—It would defer a clear U.S. denunciation of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime’s actions on
                            expropriation.</p>
                        <p>Option 4. The same as Option 3, but looking to the possibility of not
                            applying the <persName corresp="#p_HBB_1">Hickenlooper</persName>
                            Amendment so long as plausible grounds existed for delay. Investors
                            would be encouraged to exhaust local remedies. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HBB_1">Hickenlooper</persName> sanctions might be
                            applied gradually with as little publicity as possible to avoid
                            confrontation on a set date.</p>
                        <p>Advantages.</p>
                        <p>—It would permit maximum flexibility for the U.S. to pursue its basic
                            objective of maintaining a correct public posture and limiting economic
                            support for the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            regime.</p>
                        <p>—It would avoid a direct confrontation which could disrupt the
                            inter-American system.</p>
                        <p>—It would maximize the legal justification and support of the actions
                            which the U.S. may take.</p>
                        <p>Disadvantages.</p>
                        <p>—It would delay a clear U.S. denunciation of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime’s actions.</p>
                        <p>—It could incur Congressional charges that the Executive branch ignores
                            the <persName corresp="#p_HBB_1">Hickenlooper</persName> Amendment and
                            is coddling a Communist regime.</p>
                        <p>—It would protract the flow of assistance.</p>

                        <p>43. Subj: The Evident Becomes Obvious (Part I of IV).</p>
                        <p>1. President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> moved to
                            Valparaiso today in another innovation aimed at advertising Popular
                            Unity’s proximity to the people (including, I assume, those filling all
                            those bikinis on the beaches of the Pacific). The President and his
                            associates have earned their two months bask in the sun. They have
                            attained every initial goal of their program to make Chile a socialist
                            state:</p>
                        <p>A. They have consolidated their power in Chile with astonishing ease.</p>
                        <p>B. They are implementing most of their electoral program without
                            engendering serious resistance.</p>
                        <p>C. They have maintained their coalition without meaningful
                            disruptions.</p>
                        <p>D. They have gained the undiluted loyalty of the armed forces, the
                            blessing of the Church, the compliance of the bourgeoisie, and the
                            legitimacy of the international community.</p>
                        <p>2. The revolution launched by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> will not be slowed or diverted by the summer
                            transfer of the seat of govt to Chile’s second city. As that most astute
                            of Chilean politicians, Communist Party head <persName
                                corresp="#p_CLL_1">Corvalan</persName> told a pre-Christmas
                            interviewer from Rome’s <hi rend="italic">L’Unita:</hi> “The situation
                            is certainly not yet irreversible; it is up to us to make it so.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_CLL_1">Corvalan</persName> explained that all
                            the U.P. basic programs would be put into the hopper as fast as possible
                            (“within one month”). The pace had to be forced, he said, so that Chile
                            would be irrevocably placed on the path to socialism. “Were we to limit
                            ourselves to a redistribution of income and to reducing inflation and
                            unemployment, we would fall into a reformist policy,” said <persName
                                corresp="#p_CLL_1">Corvalan</persName>. “The process must proceed
                            toward the trans<pb n="240" facs="0280" xml:id="pg_240"/>formation of
                            the present economic and social system and the reforms must be such, in
                            depth and in relation with each other, as to place the country on the
                            path leading to socialism.” Socialism by <persName corresp="#p_CLL_1"
                                >Corvalan</persName>’s definition is not the Scandinavian or Israeli
                            model; it is the Eastern European.</p>
                        <p>3. Despite the surface calm, the import of <persName corresp="#p_CLL_1"
                                >Corvalan</persName>’s end and <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s means are just beginning to be understood by
                            growing numbers of affected Chileans. As a perceptive American recently
                            said: “When we lack the will to see things as they really are, there is
                            nothing so mystifying as the obvious.” What is starting to occur here is
                            that the obvious has become so overpoweringly evident that it is finally
                            creating some will to see reality. Of the many personal evidences that I
                            have received the past few days, perhaps the most striking was that of
                                <persName corresp="#p_HLF_1">Felipe Herrera</persName> (protect) who
                            has steadfastly insisted, like <persName corresp="#p_PLG_1">Galo
                                Plaza</persName> and most other Latin “names” that “it can’t happen
                            here”. <persName corresp="#p_HLF_1">Herrera</persName> likened the
                            Chilean Govt to a runaway horse, out of control and racing ever faster.
                            He lamented that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            appeared to be drunk with power, deaf to all advice. Thus <persName
                                corresp="#p_HLF_1">Herrera</persName> has concluded that he will
                            proceed with a long European vacation after leaving the <gloss

                        <p>4. Ex-President Frei said the Chilean situation is evolving so fast and
                            so irreversibly that he wonders whether he can leave the country after
                            the municipal elections, as he has planned, because he might not have
                            any political base when he returns. Benjamin Matte, the head of the once
                            powerful National Society of Agriculture who thought he could buy time
                            and tolerance by offering to cooperate fully with <persName

                            agriculture deals with Cuba, is planning to announce his resignation
                            shortly for having been so totally misled. Scores of businessmen,
                            scrambling to keep their heads above water, are despondently
                            reconsidering their decisions to try to hold out in Chile and are once
                            again seriously contemplating emigration. <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1"
                                >Tomic</persName>istas whose confidence in Chilean traditions
                            persuaded them to vote for <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"

                            increasing number of Radical and Nacional politicos are in the same
                            frame of mind; and even some “extreme” Socialists are making known their
                            annoyance and disquiet over the Communist ascendancy within the
                            govt.</p>
                        <p>5. The speed and skill with which <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> is realizing the Chilean revolution has thus far
                            robbed his natural opposition of any field where they could give battle.
                            Until now, he has not used any of the classical recipes for imposing
                            socialism. There have been no firing squads, no arbitrary arrests, no
                            obvious censorship, no barriers to free travel, no anti-religious
                            excesses (on the contrary he insisted on attending a Te Deum following
                            his inauguration). As I wrote the night of election (Santiago <pb
                                n="241" facs="0281" xml:id="pg_241"/>3499 Paras 10 et seq), Chile is
                            the only country that I knew where a govt could follow traditional
                            procedures and utilize democratic institutions to install within a
                            normal Presidential term an irrevocable Marxist-Leninist model. A
                            significant sector of informed Chilean opinion is now beginning to
                            comprehend the methods and to perceive the goal. The purpose of this
                            series of cables is to detail some illustrative examples of this unique
                            procedure. To report some of the political and social consequences that
                            it is fomenting, and to offer some comments. (End Part I)</p>

                            43.</p>
                        <p>1. The past Sunday’s <hi rend="italic">Mercurio</hi> signalled the end of
                            the two-month truce between that once loud anti-Communist thunderer and
                            the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime. For the
                            first time since the paper’s management decided Nov 5 to seek to woo
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> rather than to wound
                            him, it moved undisguisedly over to the attack. Its representatives have
                            come to me to explain their decision and to inform us that the paper
                            will go down fighting rather than be sapped of its prestige and
                            influence by a drip-drip economic torture or by a provocative labor
                            conflict. It wants the world to know that when it ceases to publish it
                            was for political reasons. It has little doubt now that it will not last
                            the years that transpire before the mass of Chileans become equally
                            aware.</p>
                        <pb n="242" facs="0282" xml:id="pg_242"/>
                        <p>2. In the interim, the ownership of <hi rend="italic">Mercurio</hi> (no
                            longer <persName corresp="#p_EEA_1">Agustin Edwards</persName> who has
                            emigrated to the US and is now working for a US concern) is stripping
                            for this final battle by unloading liabilities so that it can hurl bolts
                            at the Marxists for the longest possible time. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Mercurio</hi> had difficulty meeting its payroll the past week. In
                            pre-electoral times, it was the organ for 69 percent of all daily
                            advertising in the Chilean press. Its average advertising has been
                            almost halved and is steadily sinking. (Its circulation is only off by 5
                            percent while its sister publications, the afternoon tabloid <hi
                                rend="italic">Ultima Noticias</hi> is holding its own at 45,000.)
                                <hi rend="italic">Mercurio</hi> is proprietor of the finest and most
                            modern print jobber in the country if not the continent, Lord Cochrane
                            Press. The latter has assets of 100,000,000 escudos and liabilities of
                            60,000,000; although it keeps 700 employees busy three shifts and has
                            annual sales of 130,000,000 escudos with a good profit, its cash flow,
                            because of debt, is negative and a heavy drain on <hi rend="italic"
                                >Mercurio.</hi> If the govt, which is planning to establish a state
                            editorial house is unwilling to buy the enterprise at book value, Lord
                            Cochrane will soon declare itself bankrupt and force creditor banks
                            (including [omission in the original] to make the best possible deal.
                            Similarly <hi rend="italic">Mercurio</hi> is seeking to unload its once
                            profitable and popular radio sta-tion, Corporation of Santiago.
                            Corporation has a book value of some 2,000,000 escudos but is now
                            running a monthly loss of 400,000 escudos as the private sector
                            retrenches and as govt advertising is withheld. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Mercurio</hi> has been negotiating to sell Radio Corporation to the
                            proprietor of a provincial station Radio Bio Bio. And therein lies a
                            revealing tale about this govt.</p>
                        <p>3. When the Banco Edwards was intervened by the govt last month for
                            allegedly having violated the regulations governing import of capital,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> Socialist intimate
                            Erich Schnake approached the <hi rend="italic">Mercurio</hi>–Banco
                            Edwards management to offer a deal. He revealed that the would-be
                            purchaser of Radio Corporation was a dummy for Ancieto Rodriguez, the
                            Secretary-General of the Socialist Party. He said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> did not want <persName
                                corresp="#p_RGP_1">Rodriguez</persName> to gain control of the
                            station and that he wanted it for his own faction. Schnake said that if
                                <hi rend="italic">Mercurio</hi> would sell the station to him and to
                            other <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> associates, the
                            President would see to it that the Banco Edwards matter was arranged
                            amicably.</p>
                        <p>4. Meanwhile the Banco Edwards lawyers were meeting with the Socialist
                                <persName corresp="#p_ICA_1">Alfonso Inostroza</persName>, head of
                            the Central Bank, and two other high bank officials, both Socialists, to
                            arrange an out-of-court settlement. The Central Bank’s counsel admitted
                            in these talks that the charges against the Edwards Bank would not be
                            sustained by any court and that therefore an amicable accord was
                            preferable. <hi rend="italic">Mercurio</hi> then decided to accept the
                            Schnake deal.</p>
                        <pb n="243" facs="0283" xml:id="pg_243"/>
                        <p>5. The final episode came last week:</p>
                        <p>A. Schnake after seven days in which he claimed to have talked three
                            times to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> confessed he
                            could not deliver his end of the deal.</p>
                        <p>B. The directors of the Edwards Bank were summoned to the Central Bank
                            last Wednesday where the number two man in that hierarchy, the Communist
                            Hugo Fazio, informed the directors they would be prosecuted, the bank
                            manager would be charged criminally and that none of the directors could
                            leave the country pending the judgments. When the Edwards Bank lawyer
                            protested that he had been given to understand in negotiations with the
                            govt that an amicable settlement was possible, the Communist snapped
                            “this govt does not negotiate” and demanded to know who had spoken for
                            the govt. Since the three Socialists who had participated in the earlier
                            informal talks were present, including President <persName
                                corresp="#p_ICA_1">Inostroza</persName>, and since they turned white
                            with fear, the Edwards Bank people covered for them.</p>
                        <p>6. Finally, the Edwards–<hi rend="italic">Mercurio</hi> managers have
                            been seeking to save from bankruptcy one of the biggest industrial
                            enterprises in Chile, their beer business with 3000 employees in eight
                            cities. Cash flow is again the problem since no price increases have
                            been allowed for a year despite 35 percent inflation and wage increases
                            of some 40 percent that the govt has decreed must be incorporated into
                            costs. As with most other enterprises, management has been unable to see
                            any cabinet official although bankruptcy is certain with two months
                            without price relief. When an appointment was finally secured last week
                            with the head of the price-setting agency <gloss target="#t_Dirinco_1"
                                >Dirinco</gloss>, it was informed:</p>
                        <p>A. No price increase would be permitted for all 1971.</p>
                        <p>B. No management rep would again be received. Only reps of a blue-collar
                            union would be given audiences.</p>
                        <p>C. The company had assets it could sell to keep operating until [omission
                            in the original].</p>
                        <p>D. In 1972, the company would be incorporated into the mixed-economy area

                        <p>7. Now if we deemed the Edwards case rather unique because of the
                            dominant position that this one clan had in Chile, the foregoing details
                            would not be all that noteworthy. But they typify the rule more than the
                            exception insofar as any significant enterprise in Chile is concerned.
                            The beer business, strangely enough, is enjoying a 30 percent rise in
                            consumption since the elections, and has attracted the interest of West
                            German investors, with whom management is now in discussion. But in many
                            other cases, there are no buyers aside from the govt in sight. I
                            continue to rely on <persName corresp="#p_CLL_1">Corvalan</persName>’s
                            candor: “The people have won the government,” he said, “which is part of
                            the political power. They <pb n="244" facs="0284" xml:id="pg_244"/>must
                            consolidate this victory and advance further so that the entire
                            political power and state apparatus should pass into their hands.” (End

                        <p>1. Banks and copper have been the first major nationalization targets of
                            the govt. Coal, a hopeless industry in Chile, was also taken over and
                                <persName corresp="#p_CLL_1">Corvalan</persName> promises that
                            shortly all the other basic units of Chilean industry will be
                            nationalized. Since the first two are the most significant for Chile’s
                            economy and for its future structure, the procedures and the dominant
                            attitudes of the govt are instructive.</p>
                        <p>2. A very reliable Chilean informant who spoke to <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Max Nolff</persName>, the head of the govt copper
                            corporation, on Jan 4th, discovered that he believes (and it should be
                            emphasized that <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nolff</persName> is the most
                            influential of the Marxists when it comes to copper) that (A) Kennecott
                            should pay Chile for having too great a profit instead of receiving any
                            compensation for its remaining 49 percent in the El Teniente mine; (B)
                            that the reaction of the world press and the Western govts to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime has been so
                            favorable that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> can be as tough
                            as it wishes with the US companies; (C) that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> will insist on implementing the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> proposal (in the
                            draft constitutional amendment authorizing the copper nationalization)
                            that past profitability can be adjudged excessive and the surpluses
                            deducted from the compensation; (D) that eventual renegotiation of debts
                            to Ex-Im and other creditors will not pose <pb n="245" facs="0285"
                                xml:id="pg_245"/>any great problem and (E) there is no danger of any
                            effective foreign court action by the copper companies to block Chilean
                            sales or to seize assets. My informant said that other equally reliable
                            emanations from the Communists indicate that they feel there is no
                            reason to be anything but severe with the copper companies and that if
                            the US were to react, either by company or by govt, the US would then be
                            cast in the villain’s role of waging unjustified economic war that in
                            turn would justify further turnings of the screw within Chile.</p>
                        <p>3. Some of these soundings may be nerve war rumblings since a tested
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> tactic is to use the
                            Revolutionary Left (<gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss>) to push things
                            to the extreme so that when he intervenes magistrally, his solution
                            looks better, but better only in comparison to the most extreme. However
                            it is increasingly evident that the U.P. is not so much interested in
                            how the economy will operate in 1971 as it is in achieving the profound
                            socio-economic changes that will set the country in socialism. It is so
                            cockahoop with its success in mesmerizing the country, so self-satisfied
                            with its $500,000,000 in reserves and so reassured by promises of
                            substantial long-term credits from European and Japanese suppliers that
                            both knowledgeable Christian Democrats and independents such as
                                <persName corresp="#p_HLF_1">Felipe Herrera</persName> may be on the
                            target with their judgment that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> is already drunk with success. If he is
                            intemperate, the world press has contributed to his exaltation by its
                            applause of his copper and bank nationalizations. When the <hi
                                rend="italic">London</hi> and <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>
                            characterize such proposals as moderate, any student of the law,
                            whatever his views of social justice, can only throw up his hands.</p>
                        <p>4. The innocence abroad makes it extremely difficult for the opposition
                            parties here to find firm footing to contest a bill that involves the
                            nationalization of US copper enterprises. Both the Christian Democrats
                            and the Nacionales consider most of the terms of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> proposal to be outlandishly
                            severe. I have reason to believe that there is an even chance that the
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> will submit amendments that
                            would simply have the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> buy the
                            remaining shares of the company at book value less depreciation. Payment
                            might also be the 30 years at 3 percent that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> proposes and that reduces the
                            real cost to Chile to a fraction.</p>
                        <p>But such a proposal would in effect sanctify the deals for the first 51
                            percent negotiated by Frei and would render to the companies payment far
                            in excess of what the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> is
                            contemplating. Other amendments might soften such harsh terms as the
                            historic profit measure, depletion of mines as a deduction and the
                            threat of non-payment to banking institutions such as Ex-Im because the
                            money had not been spent for whatever the President deemed to be
                            socially unuseful. The opposition will of course focus on workers
                            rights, will seek to strike out the general clause that throws into
                            doubt all contracts between all private entities and the govt whatever
                            the nature of the accord and may <pb n="246" facs="0286" xml:id="pg_246"
                            />insist on normal judicial review rather than the kangeroo court of
                            political appointees to review any appeals that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is proposing. But they
                            emphasize that to a large degree, the opposition is dependent on what
                            the rest of the world is saying and that so far the only comments are
                            encouraging to the extremists in the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NM_1">Nolff</persName>’s case against Kennecott
                            is that in the original 1965 deal with the Frei govt, the book value of
                            the company’s 51 percent was overstated by $8,000,000 and that by
                            applying the historic profit test, the final result would be negative
                            compensation. <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> negotiators, seeking
                            of course to protect the Frei administration record and to preserve the
                            fundamentals of the Frei Chileanization program, argued with <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM_1">Nolff</persName> that the purchase of the
                            remaining shares would cost Chile approx $275,000,000 paid out over long
                            term (in addition to the original 51 percent already negotiated).
                            Against that they say that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                            formula would immediately provoke full calls by the Ex-Im and other
                            bankers and would require either a $400,000,000 payoff in the short-term
                            by Chile or a confrontation with the US. Hence they stress the
                            importance of the role of the world press, particularly serious
                            analytical material in the most serious press, daily, weekly,
                            monthly.</p>
                        <p>6. Opposition experts feel that, to use Frei’s word, the most “brutal”
                            segment of the Copper nationalization is the inclusion of Andina mine,
                            the 70 percent owned by Cerro brand new undertaking (30 percent <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>) and of Exotica (Anaconda 75 percent
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> 25 percent). The measure the
                                <hi rend="italic">
                                <gloss target="#t_NYT_1">NYTimes</gloss>
                            </hi> applauds applies in theory only to what the Chilean law terms
                            “Gran Mineria” which is defined as 75,000 tons output yearly. Andina
                            which has yet to make any money, which has a projected capacity output
                            of 65,000, which required approx $160,000,000 to open, almost double the
                            planned investment, and which brought a very high degree of technology
                            to the most difficult exploitation in Chile is included in
                            discriminatory fashion in the bill. (Exotica produces 25,000 tons but is
                            much integrated in big Chuqui operation.) Although Andina will only
                            produce 40,000 tons its first year, a French mine with 41,000 tons and a
                            German mine with 31,000 tons output, both with high profits over many
                            years, were excluded. Two executives of Cerro arrived here from New York
                            Jan 4 for a Jan 5 appointment they had sought with the Minister of
                            Finance (Communist) who promptly shunted them off to the Central Bank
                            without discussing their problems. They encountered no satisfaction at
                            the Central Bank and are now reverting to my original suggestion of last
                            week that they write a forthright letter to <persName corresp="#p_NM_1"
                                >Nolff</persName> stating why they cannot meet their Ex-Im Bank or
                            Sumitomo payments on loans and why the company will be forced to stop
                            work next week if there is no financial relief authorized by the <gloss

                        <p>7. As for the 22 Chilean banks, they too are encountering the gravest
                            difficulties in responding intelligently to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s ploy of offering to buy out all shareholders
                            at a better price than that offered in the nationalization bill he will
                            shortly submit. While the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> had
                            planned to fight this bill to prevent a centralized state control which,
                            as <hi rend="italic">Mercurio</hi> pointed out Sunday, will give the
                            state total power over all debtors, including politicians and their
                            supporters, the bank owners and managers met privately Jan 4 to consider
                            their tactics. The majority felt that they required a political
                            solution, which meant support from the opposition parties; but they
                            quickly concluded that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            had left the opposition high and dry, particularly when the biggest
                            private bank, the Banco de Chile, noted that its shares are very widely
                            held and that a majority of its modest stockholders would wish to avail
                            themselves of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s offer to
                            pay cash for the first 10,000 escudos of stock at market values of one
                            year ago and the next 40,000 in readjustable savings certificates. Also
                            the half score of banks controlled by rich Arab families were anxious to
                            accept the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> offer since
                            they believe that cooperation in this instance may gain some
                            transitional but essential favors for their other varied industries. The
                            meeting ended without agreement as is typical in the Chilean private
                            sector, thus providing further maneuverability to the Marxists in their
                            divide and conquer strategy.</p>
                        <p>8. Nonetheless anti-Marxists of the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>,
                            the <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss> and of the small Democratic
                            Radical Party are having intensive talks to determine whether they can
                            put forward this week a public proposal that would offer exactly the
                            same buyout terms as <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            to the stockholders but that would be included in a counter version of a
                            nationalization law. The distinguishing difference in the alternative
                            nationalization would be decentralization rather than centralized state
                            control. Each bank would be run by the workers and employees as a
                            cooperative. As with everything else, the opposition is less than united
                            and the diehard conservatives of the Nacional Party are still opposed to
                            any accords, public or otherwise, with the Christian Democrats. The
                            latter are now controlled by the Frei faction and are much more disposed
                            to negotiate realistically than even a fortnight ago; the Nacionales are
                            still led by those who consider Frei to be Chile’s Kerensky and who
                            still have the conviction that a deal with the Socialists is preferable
                            and possible. However this faction of the Nacionales is weakening daily
                            as their supporters are hit from every side; it is not impossible that a
                            change of leadership will be effected in the near future with party head

                        <p>9. As for the four foreign banks (two US being Bank of America and First
                            National City) the current private report is that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> intends to pay full book value
                            ($12,000,000 total for the four), that he will <pb n="248" facs="0288"
                                xml:id="pg_248"/>give the four the full calendar year 1971 to settle
                            their in-house affairs, that the doors of the four will be closed by
                            July 1 and that if they wish, they can then maintain representatives
                            here to deal with foreign banking. The obvious purpose is to keep open
                            the lines to Western credits and to give a fair enough deal so as not to
                            prejudice such access. (End Part III).</p>

                        <p>1. By any objective measure, the actions of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> govt please the majority of
                            the Chilean people. Moreover the majority of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s actions will benefit the
                            mass. And “mass” is the key word for the Marxists.</p>
                        <p>2. Although the Communist <persName corresp="#p_CLL_1"
                                >Corvalan</persName> can state with chilling accuracy that this govt
                            does not intend to be “reformist” and does not intend merely to increase
                            employment, effect redistribution and augment production, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is building his irresistible
                            momentum by such reforms. What political party can be opposed to higher
                            wages, price rollbacks, greater social security benefits and a massive
                            redistribution of income? What politician can argue against “land
                            reform” that will initially expropriate only the 3500 to 4000 farms that
                            remain above the maximum limit of 200 basic irrigated acres? For the
                            mass of peasants with tiny holdings, the word “cooperative” is not and
                            should not be a discouraging perspective despite the simultaneous use of
                            “state farm”. <pb n="249" facs="0289" xml:id="pg_249"/>In the interim
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has cancelled the
                            land tax for all those with incomes of less than some $3000. What is
                            objectionable about reducing the cost of credit by 25 percent and
                            promising to make it available to the small industrialist, to the small
                            farmer and to the cooperatives? What is more logical in a country of
                            only 9,300,000 than to trim from eleven to three the number of auto
                            companies? What is more sensible than to create mass money supply so
                            that domestic industries will get a volume sufficient to lower real
                            costs and so that the society as a whole can concentrate on increasing
                            output and boost its non-traditional exports? Who would oppose a half
                            liter of milk to every child daily, free school books, free medicines,
                            greater access to university and even “peoples courts”? This last idea
                            is justified as unclogging a court system overloaded with minor cases
                            that could easily be decided on a neighborhood level by representatives
                            of the people.</p>
                        <p>3. The evident truth is that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> is doing a great many things that most people
                            would agree are good for Chile and he is doing nothing that he did not
                            say he would do prior to the election. He has so far reneged on only one
                            of his electoral planks—to leave the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1"
                                >IMF</gloss>—and who would fault him for reversing that pledge? He
                            said he would wage class war against a small minority that had
                            inordinate power and wealth; they are his only domestic victims so far.
                            He said he would reduce Chile’s tremendous dependence on the US. He is
                            fulfilling that goal. Because the conservatives in this country are, and
                            have been so deservedly discredited and because the anti-Marxists threw
                            away their numerical majority in blind parochialism, the majority of the
                            middle class in this unique land with its 90 percent literacy and 75
                            percent urbanization is not at all perturbed by what has occurred in the
                            first two months of the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            govt. I might add that the majority of US press, itching with a
                            hairshirt of guilt, sticks to a birdseye view and flutters with joy.</p>
                        <p>4. DeGaulle when he visited Chile several years ago described it as “the
                            pilot country for Latin America”. Regis Debray, a young revolutionary
                            whose ideas contributed to the May 1968 French upheaval that led to the
                            downfall of DeGaulle, said last night in his first press conference that
                            the Chilean revolution was a “colossal” event and that it would have
                            repercussions in Europe as well as Latin America. Debray is much
                            intrigued by the novelty of the Marxist methodology here and is delaying
                            his departure to Cuba to learn more before he begins applying his
                            experience in other parts. For what it is worth, I think both Frenchmen,
                            like De Toqueville about the US, have an extraordinary perspicacity.</p>
                        <p>5. Two months of observing <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> has reinforced my original appreciation. He is a
                            dedicated socialist; he is a shrewd politician; he is not a Communist;
                            he is determined to serve six years, to effect his pro<pb n="250"
                                facs="0290" xml:id="pg_250"/>gram of establishing a “Republic of the
                            Workers”, to do it within a legal framework. He wants Chile to be
                            independent in the sense of not being dependent on a foreign country, be
                            it the Soviet Union or China. But he is unalterably and implaccably
                            opposed to all that US society represents today, starting with the
                            profit motive and our historic record in L.A. Except where the US will
                            agree with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, he will oppose us
                            in every international forum and in some cases such as the Law of the
                            Sea, he will stand against both the superpowers. So far, there is
                            nothing exceptionable in the foregoing insofar as other areas of the
                            world are concerned. But he will cooperate in every manner possible to
                            have the Chilean experience emulated in every Latin country and indeed,
                            his success here has already had manifold effects. For the US therefore,
                            it means a complete overhaul of its assumptions about Latin America,
                            particularly South America. That political genius of Chilean Communism,
                                <persName corresp="#p_TV_1">Velodia Teitelboim</persName>, said in
                            an interview in Montevideo last month, that Popular Unity proved that
                            President Frei had exaggerated the importance of the US in Latin America
                            and that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_VSG_1">Valdes</persName>
                            had understood and enacted a contrary foreign policy that had great
                            significance. In that sense, DeGaulle’s terminology might well be
                            prophetic.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has set in motion the
                            greatest change Chile has known since independence. Leaving aside
                            foreign implications, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            would be a rare leader indeed if he could control the forces he has
                            loosed. He is enacting a populist program that will reinforce the
                            already sharp appetites of a population that was, under Frei, emerging
                            rapidly from backwardness, marginality and isolation. He is establishing
                            a bureaucratic centralism that will directly or indirectly convert every
                            nonpolitical organization in Chile into a full or quasi arm of the
                            state. This combination has inevitably led elsewhere to greater
                            controls, more centralism and finally to repression.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and his associates are
                            raising hell publicly with the Supreme Court’s reversal of a lower
                            court’s decision to lift the congressional immunity of rightist Senator
                            Raul Morales on charges growing out of the <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1"
                                >Schneider</persName> assassination. At the same time he is
                            deliberately encouraging prosecution of such dubious cases as of the
                            Edwards Bank and is seeking to establish a kangaroo court for the copper
                            nationalization. In sum he is arranging events in order to justify an
                            overhaul of Chile’s traditional independent judiciary. He is doing it
                            legally but it is the threat of the mass pressure that will produce the
                            result he and the Communists want.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is also raising hell
                            publicly with the two leading anti-Communist newsmen in radio and
                            privately his lieutenants are beginning to put pressure on some of the
                            few remaining non-conformist voices in the press. TV is already his.
                            With decreasing advertising and <pb n="251" facs="0291" xml:id="pg_251"
                            />consequent decreasing numbers of news pages, with increasing
                            dependence on the state for revenue, for price increases, for credit,
                            for labor peace and for other govt favors, can anyone seriously propound
                            the notion that the conditions for a free press genuinely exist? (<hi
                                rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> has many problems not the least of
                            which is that <persName corresp="#p_EEA_1">Agustin Edwards</persName>’s
                            sister Sonia, the only Edwards on the board of directors and an
                            Allendista, is now hopelessly in love with the extreme left wing
                            Socialist Senator <persName corresp="#p_AOC_1">Altamirano</persName>.)
                            Perhaps most illuminating is the case of Dario Saint Marie, known as
                            Volpone here the sole owner of <hi rend="italic">Clarin,</hi> the most
                            populist of all Chilean papers, second only to <hi rend="italic"
                                >Mercurio</hi> in circulation and a staunch supporter of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. Volpone is a millionaire many
                            times over as a result of his start in life as a successful blackmailer,
                            drug-runner and today, as a crypto-racketeer. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Clarin</hi> has been licensed to print money with the Frei govt
                            buying peace from <hi rend="italic">Clarin</hi> by stuffing it with govt
                            advertising and an aid special letter of credit to buy new modern
                            equipment. Now Volpone has discovered that the paper has been
                            effectively captured by the Communists through their control of the shop
                            journalist union. Although a close personal friend of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, his complaints have so far
                            been unavailing and he may well try to sell the paper and quit Chile to
                            enjoy his fat foreign bank accounts. But he is so vulnerable that the
                            Communists are standing firm and the outcome of this test of amoral
                            wills is going to have wider implications.</p>
                        <p>9. Wildcat strikes unless prompted by the govt have almost disappered
                            since <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> came to power.
                            There has been one at the Chuquicamata oxide plant for one week but as I
                            have noted in the past that mine has the most bloody-minded workers in
                            the country and they will not be easy to cow. The govt has already won
                            the support there of all the unions at the mine against the strikers
                            (whose walkout is totally unpublicized in the free press) and it would
                            not be rash to predict that the govt will have its way. Since the
                            Communists control the national trade union <gloss target="#t_CUT_1"
                                >CUT</gloss>, and since <gloss target="#t_CUT_1">CUT</gloss> has
                            been designated the sole voice of labor in its dealings with gov, the
                            demise of pluralistic trade unionism is not far off.</p>
                        <p>10. Political parties and indeed democracy depend in the last analysis on
                            freedom of expression and the effective capacity to have that expression
                            reach the electorate. The <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> can
                            appear on TV debates and state its views; it can publish its one
                            newspaper with a claimed circulation of 25,000 (as opposed to <hi
                                rend="italic">Mercurio</hi>’s estimate of 15,000) and it can
                            broadcast on the one of the 29 stations in Santiago that it owns. The
                            other opposition parties have no Santiago newspaper per se although the
                                <hi rend="italic">Mercurio</hi> trio must be credited to their cause
                            and only two remaining radio stations, neither of which will be in hands
                            unfriendly to the govt for long since a combination of tight money and
                            of govt blackmail against the current owners are forcing the proprietors
                            to consider only “friendly” bids.</p>
                        <pb n="252" facs="0292" xml:id="pg_252"/>
                        <p>11. Political parties depend also on mass organization and structure. The
                            Communist Party had its way this week, gaining <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s concurrence against initial
                            Socialist opposition, to convoke the Santiago provincial apparat that
                            the U.P. organized for <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            campaign so that the governing unity will be reinforced for the
                            municipal elections. Hardly a worker or a small or large businessman
                            will not be forced to buy the equivalent of “protection” by contributing
                            to the U.P. campaign for the nationwide municipal elections in early
                            March. Many will do so gladly in gratitude for the many benefits that
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has conferred. But
                            many with meager means and with doubts will cough up because of the peer
                            pressure and out of fear; hence they will neither be able to work for or
                            contribute to opposition parties. Once again a birds-eye view misses the
                            subsurface.</p>
                        <p>12. I have cited a few of the instances by which Chilean democracy and
                            traditions are being altered in substance if not in appearance. The
                            point is that a momentum is being developed that will give the Unidad
                            Popular a huge vote in the municipal elections, that between them the
                            Communists and Socialists may get 40 percent of the total vote, that
                            these two Marxist parties will not fall into the trap of competing
                            openly with each other but will concentrate its efforts on grinding down
                            the opposition and that this Marxist combination is establishing a tight
                            bureaucratic centralism that will develop its own accelerating
                            anti-pluralistic thrust. A great many romantic Chileans believe they can
                            split <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> from the
                            Communists. The Communists need <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> indispensably as the umbrella under which they
                            legitimize their push for power; nothing can unstick them. Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_AOC_1">Altamirano</persName>, who was
                            considered to be an anti-Communist because of his Maoist views, told <hi
                                rend="italic">Punto Final:</hi> “Socialist-Communist unity is and
                            will be the base for all our action which in turn ought to be founded on
                            a solid identity of both strategic and tactical goals.” Debray makes the
                            same point of the need for Marxist unity with the Revolutionary Left
                                (<gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss>) acting as the defender of the
                            revolution to prevent the govt or the U.P. from being entrapped by
                            becoming bourgeois or by being softened by the bourgeoisie.
                            Significantly Debray says that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> understands this entrapment threat and will
                            combat it. There are others, particularly in the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>, who argued that the U.P. could not
                            run its economy without their cooperation; they are dead wrong. Not only
                            does the U.P. have just as many trained technicians of more or less
                            equal calibre, but they have an ideological outlook that is cohesive and
                            they have the labor discipline and the mass structure to enforce their
                            will. <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>ers will be given the option
                            of being loyal or of being outcasts.</p>
                        <p>13. For all these reasons, the opposition is now hastily confronting the
                            realities and the most intelligent of their leaders are talking the
                            kinds of deals that might make some sense. Here are some short-term
                            possibilities:</p>
                        <pb n="253" facs="0293" xml:id="pg_253"/>
                        <p>A. The Nacional Party has designated Deputy Silvia Alessandri to be its
                            candidate for the senatorial seat vacated in Magallanes by <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. She has not yet formally
                            accepted. The <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> has not yet named a
                            candidate. There is a chance that a deal will be arranged whereby
                            Alessandri withdraws her name at the last moment before the election and
                            gives freedom of action to her supporters. The anti-Marxists have a
                            majority in Magallanes and a victory for the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> there would do much to balance the simultaneous weak
                            showing they expect in the municipal elections.</p>
                        <p>B. An overturning of the U.P.’s control of the Mesa Directiva in the
                            Chamber of Deputies and its replacement by a coalition of
                            oppositionists.</p>
                        <p>C. A coordinated resignation of various private enterprise association
                            heads rather than the inchoate and ineffectual individual dealings.</p>
                        <p>D. Successful efforts to alter various legislation in the Congress
                            submitted by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>.</p>
                        <p>E. Greater effectiveness in publicizing in the Western world the sharply
                            increasing preoccupations so that the [garble] here will provide a
                            better base for opposition.</p>
                        <p>14. None of these measures will alter the inevitable thrust of events but
                            they might provide enough footing to enable the opposition to assure
                            enough pluralism for later confrontations when the consequences of state
                            control of the economy begin to be felt. It will be the politicians and
                            the mass of the people, not the army, that might save Chilean pluralism.
                            The armed forces are considered totally safe now by the Communists and
                            Socialists. They are not a political force in Chile; they are always for
                            order and the fatherland. (End Part IV)</p>

                        <p>719. 1. In addition to Santiago 544 via State channels you and President
                            should be aware of fulminations against administration by some major US
                            businesses here. Embassy sending separate cable on Anaconda’s statements
                            including their comments re my position and their interpretation of <hi
                                rend="italic">Washington Post</hi> story. Others echo them.</p>
                        <p>2. As I had predicted to you, leakage about my tenure would strengthen
                            the argument of those who on Oct. 30th had advised <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> in writing to play upon the
                            alleged divisions between State and the White House and to force my
                            removal in order to strengthen <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s position in the US, in Chile and elsewhere.
                            That leak was made some weeks ago as I anticipated it would be and as I
                            was aware that it had been.</p>
                        <p>3. The wording of the Dept’s prepared press guidance in response to the
                                <hi rend="italic">Post</hi> story will only serve to confirm that
                            story and further damage the extraordinarily difficult negotiating
                            position we have here. It will without question undermine the
                            President’s authority. At a time when all the Chilean non-Marxists are
                            saying loud and clear in daily print what you said in your Chicago
                            backgrounder, the sad truth is that there are a great many misguided
                            people in Washington who seek to justify their own overtaken positions,
                            unaware that it is not social justice or social systems that should be
                            of concern but the effect on Soviet or Chinese strategists who do
                            understand the opportunities afforded by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s policies in a broad area once considered
                            “special” for the U.S. and whose perceptions do affect the security and
                            the structure of the US. When the Chilean Under-Secretary of Foreign
                            Affairs can mock the U.S. in the crude authentic language reported in
                            Santiago 565, he makes the obvious point.</p>
                        <p>4. I shall, of course, continue to keep my silence, outraged though I and
                            my family confess to being, as long as I am the President’s
                            representative. I suggest you read the Anaconda cable and I would
                            appreciate your comments. Warmest regards.</p>

                        <p>1. After very convivial dinner in honor of Amb <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> at residence last night,
                                <gloss target="#t_MinJust_1">MinInterior</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGJ_1">Toha</persName> drew me aside to say
                            President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> wished me to
                            know that he had been very interested and encouraged by <persName
                                corresp="#p_TGJ_1">Toha</persName>’s account of conversation with me
                            Jan 21 (Santiago 395). In particular, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> wanted me to understand <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss>’s disposition to seek to avoid dispute over copper and
                            that he had charged <persName corresp="#p_TGJ_1">Toha</persName> with
                            sounding me further on details. How much <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1"
                                >OPIC</gloss> insurance was involved <persName corresp="#p_TGJ_1"
                                >Toha</persName> then asked.</p>
                        <p>2. I ducked numbers in reply since I did not wish to set false price on
                            negotiations, particularly one that would not satisfy companies nor
                            resolve problem. I explained guaranties were very complicated in that
                            they could apply to investment, to debt or to both. Essence of problem
                            was that we, as Chile, had our procedures, our politics, our values; the
                            challenge to diplomacy was to seek to reconcile the different norms; the
                            manner was to avoid formulae that force inflexibility.</p>
                        <p>3. What specific suggestions could I make to the President, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TGJ_1">Toha</persName> asked. To try to retain the
                            greatest flexibility in as many of the issues involved as possible, be
                            it evaluation, term, interest, etc. in the legislation before Congress.
                            Specifically, I would suggest that <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                            give consideration to advantages of nationalizing the enterprises rather
                            than their assets since the former did not affect third party debts. I
                            did not wish to be misinterpreted as voicing any kind of implied threat
                            but I did think it important that the honor and prestige of Chile
                            insofar as previous agreements by its govts be upheld to the maximum
                            extent consistent with <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            goals. The US did not oppose nationalization as long as it was executed
                            in a manner that took into account our norms and interests and as long
                            as it did not signify discrimination and unilateral imposition. There
                            was mathematical calculation involved too: what would be the long range
                            cost to Chile of a short term imposition of its will on copper or iron
                            companies? <persName corresp="#p_TGJ_1">Toha</persName> agreed. He said
                            Frei had informed him of my role in the 1969 Anaconda negotiations and
                            therefore <pb n="256" facs="0296" xml:id="pg_256"/>the govt wished to
                            stay in close contact with me so that a mutual maximum effort could be
                            made to avoid any disturbance to our rels. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> fully shared this view and <persName
                                corresp="#p_TGJ_1">Toha</persName> hoped that we could continue to
                            talk. I said we could but that I did not wish to substitute myself for
                            the companies and that I had made the same points to those members of
                            opposition parties who had sought our views.</p>
                        <p>4. At this point MinMines Cantuarias who has a fraction of the style, wit
                            or political sophistication of <persName corresp="#p_TGJ_1"
                                >Toha</persName> wandered up to say he hoped I would use my
                            influence to persuade Bethlehem to respond favorably at the following
                            day’s meeting (with <gloss target="#t_CAP_1">CAP</gloss>). I replied
                            that I was not in the negotiation but that if I could venture a
                            suggestion, it would be that he keep in mind the importance of not
                            locking doors to possible solutions and that in diplomacy patience
                            rather than precipitation was a material of mutual understanding.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGJ_1">Toha</persName> listened attentively to
                            this exchange which I preferred not to prolong.</p>
                        <p>5. Subsequently <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AMC_1">Almeyda</persName> drew me into a lengthy
                            conversation in which he too focussed on copper. (Incidentally he
                            volunteered the comment that I made in Santiago 755 to the effect that
                            in Sunday night’s TV interview he had deliberately mentioned his
                            conversations with me so as “to dispose of” any rigorous interrogation
                            about the <hi rend="italic">
                                <gloss target="#t_NYT_1">NYTimes</gloss>
                            </hi> article and so as to demonstrate that we did have normal
                            relations). <persName corresp="#p_AMC_1">Almeyda</persName> said that
                            unlike Cuba we should together seek to avoid an escalation of problems.
                            In Cuba specifics had been inflated by ideological or global
                            considerations. If we could isolate problems such as copper so as to
                            deal with them practically they might, despite their knottiness, be
                            resolved.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_AMC_1">Almeyda</persName> said he was an
                            “extremist” by our definition and by his view of the evolution of world
                            relationships. However he followed Mao’s advice in separating short-term
                            tactics from longer-term strategy. He did not doubt that US policy had
                            not changed fundamentally insofar as its view of what might occur in
                            Chile, but he hoped we would not fall in the trap of a
                            “super-pragmatism” in which each specific problem was seen as part of
                            global strategies. He felt this was the tendency in Washington; he could
                            understand the motivation of our worldwide outlook; he trusted that we
                            could match his tactical bent.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_AMC_1">Almeyda</persName> said there were those
                            in the Popular Unity who argued that since US policy had not changed and
                            that since it could not change its view of Chile that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> should not waste time and should push
                            forward with its programs and damned the consequences. He was opposed to
                            such policies; he was prepared to help me, if I wished to avail myself
                            of his good offices within the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> and
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and to match his pragmatism
                            although he was not charged with the problem of copper since it was much
                            more general one than foreign affairs.</p>
                        <pb n="257" facs="0297" xml:id="pg_257"/>
                        <p>8. I responded in like vein. I could not speak for the <gloss

                            to copper or even to Chile since the dynamics of foreign rels and of US
                            society signified movement; US foreign policy was not a cybernetic
                            process. I was not, as he was aware, a partisan of Popular Unity; I had
                            doubts as to where it might lead. But my views of Chile’s revolution had
                            not blinded me to the overriding truth that the function of diplomacy
                            was to contain not complicate problems. As he had reminded me (by
                            references to mutual Yugoslav friends) I had the privilege of playing a
                            role in the resolution of profound problems between the US and
                            Yugoslavia in the 1949–50 period; then as now it was a matter of
                            utilizing mutuality of interest to reduce tensions and to offer new
                            perspectives. To the extent that I could influence the process, I
                            intended to do the same in Chile. I was grateful for his offer.</p>
                        <p>9. Comment: These combined efforts by the ranking Socialist members of
                            the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> cabinet (and
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGJ_1">Toha</persName> is the single closest
                            intimate of the President) do show the kind of pragmatism to which I
                            referred in my brief recent disquisition on Chilean “convivencia” when
                            confronted with the possibility of firm confrontation. I remain
                            persuaded that there is a chance for a deal if we wish to have one. I am
                            buttressed in this feeling by the talk I also had yesterday with
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZLA_1">Zaldivar</persName> and his message
                            from Irureta the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> President with
                            whom I shall be lunching Thursday. I do not wish to minimize the
                            difficulties inherent in the nationalizations problem nor dangle a false
                            hope that any negotiation will be easy or meet all our hopes. But the
                            essential question is whether we wish to avoid confrontation if it can
                            be avoided, whether we wish to make the effort. My view now as in
                            October when I proposed a talk with <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>, is that we should, and now is the appropriate
                            time to do so. If the answer were affirmative, I would do what I did in
                            1969 in the first instance—seek to define with both companies and govt
                            the possible parameters of a settlement; if they existed, to encourage
                            the parties to move towards an equilibrium that was acceptable if
                            imperfect. Then as now our involvement is essential to the <gloss

                            <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s program to nationalize
                            US properties in Chile may be setting the stage for a serious
                            confrontation. The US government has insured several properties against
                            uncompensated nationalization and stands to lose as much as $300 million
                            if Chile refuses compensation. US legislation calls for an aid cutoff in
                            the event of uncompensated expropriations of US business interests. This
                            memorandum discusses the outlook for the Chilean economy, its
                            vulnerabilities, and the likely impact of US economic sanctions that
                            might be considered.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recent Economic Trends</p>
                        <p>1. Chile’s economy has performed poorly in recent years despite record
                            copper prices averaging more than twice those in the early 1960s. During
                            the last three years there was also a massive $560 million inflow of
                            capital to expand the copper industry, and foreign aid inflows of about
                            $100 million annually. Even so, the average rate of economic growth in
                            real terms fell from 6% annually during 1965–66 to less than 3% during
                            1967–70. Per capita income has stagnated since 1966, while inflation
                            increased from a low of 17% in 1966 to almost 40% in 1970. Investment
                            outside the copper industry has fallen since 1967 and, except for
                            projects receiving government funds, private business actually has been
                            disinvesting.</p>
                        <p>2. Although the data are incomplete, it seems likely that gross domestic
                            product (GDP) fell in 1970 despite increased copper output and
                            agriculture’s partial recovery from drought. Private investment was
                            especially depressed because of the uncertainties surrounding the
                            election, and industrial output fell sharply following <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s victory in September.
                            Domestic trade was also severely disrupted during the year’s <pb n="259"
                                facs="0299" xml:id="pg_259"/>final months. Because of these factors,
                            we estimate that per capita income dropped appreciably last year and
                            probably was not much higher than in 1964, when the Frei administration
                            began.</p>
                        <p>3. Chile has traveled a long way down the road to socialism in recent
                            years. The state’s economic role, already large when Frei took office,
                            was greatly expanded during 1965–70. Increased taxes, a wage-price
                            policy that furthered income redistribution, and increasingly vocal
                            attacks on the capitalist system strongly discouraged private
                            enterprise. At the same time, an ambitious agrarian reform, although
                            falling short of its goals, radically changed land tenure in some
                            provinces and attitudes toward private property rights. These programs
                            awakened more desires than could be satisfied—especially after economic
                            performance generally began to deteriorate—thus setting the stage for
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s more radical
                            programs.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s Inheritance and
                            Initial Measures</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> did inherit some
                            substantial assets, however. The copper expansion program begun in 1967
                            now is nearly complete and will about double capacity. Foreign exchange
                            reserves accumulated as a result of extremely high copper prices during
                            most of 1969–70 amount to about $400 million. And, lastly, the foreign
                            loan pipeline contains more than $400 million in authorized but
                            unutilized credits.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> appears determined to
                            spend this inheritance, if necessary, to further his economic programs
                            and consolidate political control, and thus “make the revolution
                            irreversible.” To enhance his popularity, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> has adopted wage, price, and budgetary policies
                            which will substantially boost real incomes for most Chileans during
                            1971. Since his inauguration in November, money wages have been
                            increased by 45%, and prices (which traditionally have risen rapidly
                            after wage adjustments) have been frozen. The imminent takeover of the
                            banking system will weaken political opposition by giving the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> administration effective
                            control over most businesses. At the same time, accelerated radical
                            agrarian reform and government toleration of peasant land seizure are
                            beginning to destroy the economic base of one of Chile’s most important
                            conservative groups—the medium- and large-size farmers in the southern
                            provinces, especially in Cautin, where former President Alessandri won a
                            majority in the September election.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Chile’s Short-Term Prospects</p>
                        <p>6. Chile’s economic prospects for the next year or so were unfavorable
                            before <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s election and
                            have since worsened. Current policies will generate increasing
                            managerial problems and shortages and prevent economic growth for some
                            time. However, a severe economic downturn is not likely. The urban
                            unemployment rate did grow from <pb n="260" facs="0300" xml:id="pg_260"
                            />6% in September 1970 to 8% in December, but <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s wage and price policy should
                            help to sustain output, sales, and employment because decades of
                            inflation have conditioned Chileans to spend their incomes rapidly.
                            Moreover, if increased as planned, public investment would largely
                            offset the loss of private domestic and foreign investment, which
                            accounted for less than 30% of total investment during 1967–70.</p>
                        <p>7. The prospective sharp increase in consumer expenditures threatens
                            shortages of foodstuffs, intermediate products, and manufactured
                            consumer goods in the months ahead. Because private investment in
                            manufacturing has been extremely depressed for the past four years, we
                            doubt that output can be expanded to meet demand—especially since
                            private production incentives have been largely eliminated. Supply
                            problems will be aggravated if, as we expect, the radical agrarian
                            reform continues apace. Wheat output may increase this year, partly
                            because much of the crop was planted before <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s election, but private farmers—who still supply
                            most of Chile’s foodstuffs—have since sharply cut back their plantings
                            of other crops and have begun to slaughter breeding stock. Since
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> will likely try to
                            avoid rationing or other unpopular steps, he probably will try to
                            minimize shortages by boosting imports.</p>
                        <p>8. Increased imports, possibly compounded by failing farm output, could
                            force Chile to begin spending its foreign exchange reserves. Export
                            earnings this year could fall by $200 million because of reduced copper
                            prices, and capital inflows also are likely to decrease sharply.
                            However, because capital goods imports will also decline and profit
                            remittances of about $70 million to the copper companies will probably
                            be eliminated, Chile is unlikely to suffer a severe balance-of-payments
                            deficit. The balance of payments may well deteriorate during the next
                            few years, however, especially if copper prices remain low.</p>

                        <p>9. While the economy faces many problems in coming months, it will not
                            thereby become particularly vulnerable to economic sanctions. Investment
                            is already largely concentrated in government hands, and the complete
                            loss of US investment capital would not have a major immediate impact,
                            especially since the copper expansion program is close to the end.
                            Moreover, it would almost certainly be extremely difficult to enlist
                            West European or Japanese support for any trading sanctions against
                            Chile because these nations have gone on trading with <persName

                                target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>-made sanctions and because Chile meets
                            a major portion of their copper needs. For his part, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has apparently agreed not to
                            take action against their interests in Chile. In any case, sanctions
                            would boost <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s popularity
                            and provide an excuse to tighten political control and take desired but
                            unpopular economic actions.</p>

                        <p>10. A US embargo of Chilean goods by itself would not have much impact.
                            The United States purchased only 17% of Chile’s exports in 1969,
                            compared with 22% in 1968, and with demand for imported copper down in
                            1970, the US share of Chilean exports probably dropped further (see
                            Table 1). Copper, which makes up most of US purchases from Chile, could
                            be diverted at least in part to other markets (see Table 2). Other
                            exports to the United States—fresh fruits and vegetables, iron ore,
                            nitrates, fishmeal, wine, and various other small items—approximate only
                            $40 million a year, and about half of these could be sold elsewhere. The
                            remaining half, consisting largely of animal products and fresh fruits
                            and vegetables and making up about 2% of Chile’s exports, would be more
                            difficult to sell. However, such items may not be available for export,
                            because of disruptions from agrarian reform.</p>

                        <p>11. A US prohibition against imports of products containing Chilean
                            copper, similar to the action taken against Cuban nickel, undoubtedly
                            would be more harmful to Chile than direct trade sanctions. However,
                            such a policy would be costly to enforce and would create problems with
                            US trading partners. In any case, this policy has not proved
                            particularly effective in blocking Cuban nickel sales and would be
                            unlikely to prevent Chilean copper exports. At best, it probably would
                            create a situation in which Chilean copper was sold at a small discount
                            from the world price.</p>
                        <p>12. Chile is not critically dependent on US imports. The United States
                            has been a major supplier of capital goods, intermediate products, and
                            technical expertise—especially to the copper industry—but these items
                            are, in most cases, readily available from non-US suppliers. Moreover,
                            experience with Western economic sanctions against both Rhodesia and
                            Cuba—and before them North Korea, Communist China, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and Eastern Europe—has shown that
                            severing traditional sources of supply does not lead to severe economic
                            problems, although costs may be increased and economic growth slowed.
                            Because a smaller portion of the Chilean capital stock is of US origin
                            than was the case in Cuba, the impact of such measures as spare parts
                            denials would be more limited.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Operating the Copper Industry</p>
                        <p>13. US mining companies operating in Chile state that Chileans can
                            operate the mines despite the loss of technicians now taking place,
                            although efficiency will fall and output probably will be less than
                            under US management. Although most of the industry’s capital equipment
                            and supplies of reagents and other essential items are of US origin,
                            denial of such items would have little immediate impact. The technology
                            used is common to the copper industry, and supplies of reagents, most
                            capital replacements, and mining technicians are available in Western
                            Europe, Japan, South Africa, and Canada as well as in the Soviet Union
                            and Eastern Europe. Moreover, Chile has inventories of spare parts and
                            supplies, in most cases enough for a year or more. Over the longer run,
                            inability to obtain US equipment and supplies would increase industry
                            costs, but Chile would be able to limit the impact by cannibalizing
                            equipment and purchasing replacements outside the United States. Since
                            Chile produces the world’s lowest cost copper, moderate cost increases
                            would not make the industry uncompetitive, although they would reduce
                            government copper income.</p>

                        <p>14. Short of mounting a naval blockade and interfering with coastal
                            shipping, Chile would not be vulnerable to a US-imposed cut-off in oil
                            or other critical supplies. About half of Chile’s crude oil re<pb
                                n="263" facs="0303" xml:id="pg_263"/>quirement is produced by the
                            state-owned oil company (<gloss target="#t_ENAP_1">ENAP</gloss>) in the
                            Magallanes region, and three state-owned refineries meet most petroleum
                            product requirements. Chile now imports most of its crude oil deficit
                            from Venezuela, and some refined products are obtained from Curacao and
                            other sources. If Venezuela and Curacao agreed to halt shipments to
                            Chile, crude oil would be available from state-owned oil companies in
                            North Africa or the Middle East, and refined products could be obtained
                            in Western Europe or from Communist countries. Chile also probably could
                            import the necessary amounts of oil from Bolivia, whose crude oil is now
                            largely exported via pipeline through the Chilean port of Arica.
                            Although Bolivian crude oil has a higher gravity than that Chile now
                            uses, it could be processed if necessary. Chile recently imported
                            140,000 barrels of this crude oil to run refinery tests.</p>
                        <p>15. A denial of US capital goods and spare parts for the manufacturing
                            and transport industries would inconvenience but not appreciably harm
                            the economy. Similar goods would be available from both Western Europe
                            and Japan. In contrast to Cuba, where most transport equipment was
                            US-made, Chile has much equipment of West European manufacture. The only
                            serious limitation on Cuba’s imports from Western Europe has been a
                            severe hard currency shortage—a limitation <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> will not face.</p>
                        <p>16. Chile is highly dependent on imports for foodstuffs and agricultural
                            raw materials, but the United States is not a major supplier of either.
                            Imports of about $175 million in 1970 supplied 20% of Chile’s
                            foodstuffs. These imports consist mostly of cereals, sugar, and meat.
                            With demand likely to increase sharply because of increased real wages
                            and population and with farm output likely to stagnate at best,
                            agricultural imports will have to rise sharply if rationing is to be
                            avoided. Imports of agricultural raw materials amount to another $25
                            million and also will probably have to be increased.</p>
                        <p>17. Because higher real wages for Chile’s lower classes are quickly
                            translated into demand for food, foodstuff requirements could increase
                            by 20% or so in 1971/72. This probably would mean a doubling of food
                            imports, if major shortages are to be avoided. Increased demand will be
                            greatest for quality foods—milk, poultry, eggs, meat, and fruit. Because
                            the livestock industry is being particularly hard-hit by agrarian
                            reform, the need to import or ration animal products will be felt
                            quickly. With the ending of the current slaughter of breeding stock
                            (which comes on top of the drought losses of 1969–70), the beef shortage
                            could be severe. Milk reportedly is already in short supply as a result
                            of these factors. Aside from relatively minor <gloss target="#t_PL480_1"
                                >PL–480</gloss> shipments and some commercial wheat sales, the
                            United States has not been a major foodstuff supplier for Chile. Most
                            meat imports are from Argentina, and Chile has been expanding imports of
                            cereals and dairy products from New Zealand, <pb n="264" facs="0304"
                                xml:id="pg_264"/>Australia, and France. Chile recently concluded
                            agreements with Cuba to exchange temperate zone agricultural products
                            and wine for sugar.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Monetary Sanctions</p>
                        <p>18. Chile is not particularly vulnerable to a cessation of US government
                            aid. According to several estimates, Chile has a backlog of more than
                            $400 million in long-term credits usable over the next three years;
                            these are mostly West European suppliers credits, Soviet loans, and
                            loans from international organizations. Receipt of some of these funds
                            requires Chile to maintain interest and amortization payments on its
                            external debt which average almost $300 million annually during 1971–73.
                            For example, in the event of an uncompensated expropriation, new loans
                            from the World Bank would halt because of established policy. Only about
                            $70 million of the total backlog consists of US official loans (see
                            Table 3). US sanctions would unquestionably give Chile an excuse to
                            default on its $900 million debt to the United States. Because interest
                            and amortization payments due the United States in 1971 will total
                            $65–$70 million—against only about $30–$50 million in new disbursements
                            scheduled under all existing programs—Chile clearly would not be the
                            loser. In following years, scheduled US disbursements fall sharply,
                            while Chile’s repayment obligations increase.</p>

                        <p>19. Prior to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s election,
                            US commercial banks and other financial institutions provided about $250
                            million in short-term credits. This total has already been reduced by
                            about $50 million and, because of the dismal outlook for private
                            enterprise in Chile, many banks are attempting to reduce their exposure
                            still further. Chile probably will be able to substitute West European
                            trade credits for declining US trade credits—especially if its import
                            pattern changes—but we doubt that it <pb n="265" facs="0305"
                                xml:id="pg_265"/>will be able to replace US loans to Chilean banks
                            and corporations. However, Chile wants to maintain financial
                            respectability and probably would continue to pay these obligations for
                            at least a year or so even if this meant drawing upon reserves. Interest
                            on these private US credits currently runs about $15–$20 million per
                            year. The balance is being reduced as rapidly as possible, however, and
                            the total outflow could reach as much as $50–$100 million during 1971.
                            Official sanctions would give Chile an acceptable excuse for blocking
                            this outflow.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Other Countries’ Economic Reactions</p>
                        <p>20. US sanctions would offer Chile’s other trading partners a significant
                            commercial opportunity. The British and French already have shown their
                            eagerness to expand exports to Chile. Japan depends heavily on the US
                            market and might not aggressively pursue trade outlets in Chile for fear
                            of offending the United States. However, the Japanese are the largest
                            non-Communist buyer of Cuba’s sugar and probably would not refuse to
                            purchase increased amounts of Chilean copper and iron or supply Chile
                            with capital goods. US sanctions would also give the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> a better opportunity to expand
                            commercial and military ties with Chile. Chile would have strong motives
                            to make prompt use of the Soviet economic credit already extended and to
                            seek others. Sanctions also might rapidly lead to Soviet military sales
                            to Chile.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>21. The Chilean economy has fared poorly in recent years, and little or
                            no growth is in prospect for 1971. A severe economic downturn this year
                            is not likely, but expropriations, business failures, and stepped-up
                            land reform will doubtless cause some interruptions in output. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> apparently has adopted a
                            policy of spending to achieve immediate popular support and consolidate
                            his control. Workers’ real incomes will rise sharply, and Chile will
                            probably substantially increase its imports of foodstuffs, consumer
                            goods, and raw materials. Although exports will fall in 1971, capital
                            goods imports and profit remittances will also drop sharply and Chile
                            probably will not severely deplete its foreign exchange reserves.</p>
                        <p>22. US economic leverage is small in Chile, and economic sanctions would
                            probably be of limited impact on Chile’s economy over the next year or
                            two. The United States took only 17% of Chile’s exports in 1969 (and
                            probably less in 1970), and most of these could be sold in other
                            markets. The United States has been a major supplier of capital goods to
                            Chile, but blocking future sales would have only a small short-term
                            impact because Chile would be able to purchase similar goods from
                            Western Europe and Japan. Sanctions would probably improve Chile’s
                            financial position in the short run because they would give <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> an <pb n="266" facs="0306"
                                xml:id="pg_266"/>excuse to default on US public and private loans.
                            Disbursements on these loans at most will probably run only $30–$50
                            million in 1971, while scheduled repayments, interest, and called loans
                            probably will exceed $100 million.</p>
                        <p>23. In sum, traditional economic sanctions such as those used against
                            Cuba probably would have little immediate adverse impact on Chile.
                            Indeed they could be counter-productive. Sanctions would give <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> an excuse to tighten his
                            political control, boost his popularity locally, and increase sympathy
                            for his regime internationally as well as cause Chile to move more
                            rapidly to strengthen its ties with the Soviet Union and Eastern
                            Europe.</p>

                        <p>1. Setting aside external factors (effects on other countries) the
                            Chilean elements are:</p>
                        <p>A. The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>. Rumor notwithstanding,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> will make the
                            decision. His immediate aim is to maximize his bargaining position.
                            Congress, unions, financial pressures, propaganda, investigations of
                            mismanagement are among the array of weapons of which all but the first
                            he controls totally and will use without inhibition. His present
                            preference is to prevent a reaction that will damage a stagnant economy,
                            that would jeopardize a thumping April electoral triumph, that would
                            affect other sources of capital or that would make him a prisoner of
                            automatic processes. Once he has the election results, he will take a
                            new reading.</p>
                        <p>B. Congress. The Senate has passed a copper bill that introduces some
                            flexibility but retains unacceptable provisions regarding past <pb
                                n="267" facs="0307" xml:id="pg_267"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> commitments, evaluation methods for
                            future compensation and debt. These provisions would not satisfy the
                            companies, <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss> or international
                            norms. The House will shortly begin consideration of the bill. There is
                            a chance that some of the most intolerable conditions (the inclusion of
                            Andina and Exotica excepted) of the measure will be either eliminated or
                            significantly improved. If substantial amelioration were the result,
                                <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss>’s and Ex-Im’s greatest
                            concerns would be eased and our diplomatic problems would be tolerably
                            contained for a time. We are informed by the Senate information office
                            that the Upper House will “suspend sessions” Feb 17 to March 1 while the
                            House “recesses” Feb 15 to March 1st. Presumably this summer vacation
                            for the legislators will be followed in late March by similar
                            pre-electoral recesses or by large scale absences to permit grass-root
                            politicking. Thus it is unlikely that the House will act finally until
                            after the Sunday April 4 elections, the results of which could have a
                            determinant effect on final outcome of the bill. If the House altered
                            the measure or if the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> were to amend
                            the constitutional amendment to include iron, the bill would return to
                            the Senate. In other words it would be May before the 60 day cooling
                            period for constitutional reform began during which time <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s direct responsibility would
                            come into play. Indirectly until then he will affect the timing and the
                            content of the measure by an unlimited number of possible transactions
                            with his disorganized and fearful opposition.</p>
                        <p>C. Political parties. Their present feeling is that the copper issue has
                            been contained as a short-term electoral issue and that once the
                            elections are out of the way, they will have some greater degree of
                            maneuver. They are aware, at the same time, that other pressures could
                            develop, particularly if the extreme Socialists now in command of the
                            party and the <gloss target="#t_MAPU_1">MAPU</gloss> can increase their
                            leverage over <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> as a
                            result of a poor showing in the elections. An impressive <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> triumph could cow the
                            opposition parties into submission or could make him less heedful of
                            extremist pressures and more responsive to responsible
                            statesmanship.</p>
                        <p>D. The companies. Of the three copper companies, Andina is reduced to
                            hoping that the bill will permit debt insurance recovery from <gloss
                                target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss> and sufficient flexibility to allow
                            a true negotiation with <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>.
                            Kennecott tends to the same view with less hope for any satisfactory
                            settlement; therefore it feels that the worse the copper bill, the
                            faster and less difficult the collection of its $80 million insurance
                            from <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss>. Anaconda’s only hope lies
                            in the bill as the essential prerequisites for protecting its 51 percent
                            received and for effective negotiations for the remaining 49 percent and
                            Exotica. All three are interested in effective and adequate compensation
                            in the form of copper.</p>
                        <p>E. The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. Our parochial interests have
                            been that:</p>
                        <pb n="268" facs="0308" xml:id="pg_268"/>
                        <p>(1) There be nationalization of equity interests only with companies
                            debts being honored.</p>
                        <p>(2) Notes given for original Anaconda 51 percent be honored.</p>
                        <p>(3) A reasonable compensation package (price, term, interest) be offered
                            for equity.</p>
                        <p>2. Unless the foregoing three conditions were met, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would not be satisfied and to this
                            end, I have been working through the political parties, the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>, the copper companies and Bethlehem.
                            The basic tactical assumption has been that our first two objectives
                            could only be achieved in Congress while the third objective can only be
                            gained directly with the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> after the
                            first two have been achieved in Congress.</p>
                        <p>3. We have been seeking to utilize the Bethlehem negotiations to attain
                            our three objectives by trying to establish favorable precedents for
                            copper or alternatively prevent precedents that would adversely affect
                            the copper companies. Bethlehem has provided a useful opportunity to
                            sound out the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> on its intentions.
                            Then too a break-off in Bethlehem talks with <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> would bring to a head the issue of the expansion
                            program (almost all the material is here) and criminal responsibility of
                            Bethlehem executives for operations.</p>
                        <p>4. If we take into account each of the foregoing factors, including
                            timing, I see no choice but to buy more time. A hard line by Bethlehem
                            in which it refused to continue talks would tend to favor the
                            hard-liners in the Unidad Popular without a countervailing impact of a
                            hard <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> line. It is not the opportune
                            moment for the US to wave a big stick, be it because of its effect on
                            congressional opinion here or in the US, or before world opinion.
                            Moreover whatever I may say to the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                            will be used against us, as we have just seen in the leaks over our
                            official démarche and the fantastic interpretations that have followed
                            in the Chilean media. Thus far such leaks have not been harmful; on the
                            contrary. But we need better preparation of public opinion at home and
                            in LatAm, Europe and Japan before we can officially spell out what
                            “serious consequences” signify. Since we may be one or two months from
                            the season of negotiation with that everyman, <persName

                            including workers—fear of losing a job, fear of not getting a job, fear
                            of what a state editorial house and single line of text-books implies,
                            fear of the <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> and their impact on

                            sensitivities, has sensed this change of mood but is finding it
                            difficult to deal effectively with it. He has continued to be as
                            reassuring to everyone as he can, but words are not jobs and one man in

                        <p>B. Recent Developments:</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_SRG_1">SRG</gloss> agreed on December 23 that in
                            the event of expropriation the United States would use the six-month
                            waiting period provided by the <persName corresp="#p_HBB_1"
                                >Hickenlooper</persName> Amendment to explore the possibilities for
                            working out settlements. The negotiations would be left primarily to the
                            affected companies, though the U.S. Government might provide assistance
                            if appropriate opportunities arise. The Chilean Government would be
                            advised of our position on expropriation and compensation. We would
                            continue to apply present economic restrictions, but would be prepared
                            to relax or intensify them depending on Chilean responses and the
                            outlook for obtaining favorable results. If satisfactory progress on
                            expropriation settlements were not achieved at the end of the six-month
                            period, the question of application of the <persName corresp="#p_HBB_1"
                                >Hickenlooper</persName> Amendment would be taken to the National
                            Security Council for its consideration.</p>

                                >SRG</gloss> principals and transmitted to the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> on February 1 via Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> a démarche informing it of the
                            position of the United States on expropriation and compensation.</p>
                        <p>Our February 1 démarche registered our concern over the proposed
                            amendments to the Chilean constitution on expropriation of major copper
                            enterprises in Chile. These amendments hold little or no promise for
                            just compensation for the U.S. properties covered. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> has taken opportunities before
                            and after the major presentation of our position to impress on both
                            opposition and government leaders the desirability of flexibility over
                            rigid statutory requirements in dealing with the U.S. interests
                            affected. An accurate public criticism of the proposed constitutional
                            amendments by Senator Javits, also on February 1, received much
                            attention in Chile. Pro-government media were quick to vilify it, but it
                            may have caused some Chileans to have second thoughts on the copper
                            amendment.</p>
                        <p>The proposed amendments are still under consideration in the Congress. On
                            February 10 the Senate approved and sent to the Chamber a modified
                            version of the original draft bill which leaves most of the provisions
                            as harsh as in the original, preserves or adds confusing ambiguities,
                            but in a few significant respects offers new possibilities of
                            flexibility.</p>
                        <p>In recent conversations with influential cabinet ministers, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> has encountered a show
                            of interest in dealing with us “pragmatically” on copper. The Foreign
                            Minister offered his help to this end, stating that he opposed certain
                            of his colleagues in the coalition who favored pushing forward with
                            programs regardless of consequences. The Minister of Interior said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> wanted the
                            Ambassador to understand the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>’s
                            disposition to seek to avoid dispute <pb n="271" facs="0311"
                                xml:id="pg_271"/>over copper and that he had been charged by
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> with sounding out
                            the Ambassador. In this respect, therefore, conditions are as propitious
                            as they are likely to get to seek to bring our influence to bear on the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>’s handling of copper
                            expropriations in advance of final decisions. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> recommended that we avoid a
                            confrontation with Chile over copper if it is avoidable, that we make
                            the effort to do so, and that we make it now.</p>
                        <p>In a case which can have an important bearing on the fate of the copper
                            companies, representatives of Bethlehem Steel have been discussing with
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> officials since mid-January the
                            terms of a take-over by the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> of the
                            Bethlehem iron mine properties in Chile. Bethlehem has requested and
                            received counsel from <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss> and the
                            Embassy. We are trying to avert the imposition by the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> on Bethlehem of terms which could
                            prejudice the coming dispositions on the copper companies. The copper
                            companies are ready and willing to enter negotiations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>, but have found no interest on the

                            night of Feb 12th gave first authoritative outline of <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> intentions on copper nationalization.
                            In effect he confirmed conclusions contained Santiago 875 and working
                            assumptions on which we have been proceeding:</p>
                        <p>A. There will be no copper negotiations before Congress passes
                            constitutional amendment. Congress will not finish with the law until
                            mid-April at earliest.</p>
                        <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> will have “total
                            flexibility” in negotiations once he has will of all Chileans expressed
                            in form of new copper bill. He has now “willingly” assumed this
                            responsibility that is, according to his Ambassador, a further sign of
                            his great courage.</p>
                        <p>C. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> wish to arrive at a final accord with
                            the companies that will reflect compromises between the traditional
                            positions of the US and the initial position of the Unidad Popular.
                            “Traditional” emerged from the conversation as signifying “effective,
                            adequate and prompt” within the specifics that I enumerated in Santiago
                            875 para 1E (and in para below) while the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss> original thesis had had an automaticity for evaluation,
                            a 30 year term, 3 percent interest, a cancellation of the instruments
                            paid Anaconda for its 51 percent and a good many other rigid norms.</p>
                        <p>2. The foregoing was elicited by questioning during a cordial (I stand by
                            my original assessment of <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1"
                                >Letelier</persName> whom I genuinely like) two-hour conversation in
                            which I offered a number of observations that I qualified as personal
                            interpretations. For example, I challenged his assertion that Senate
                            passage of the bill had provided the flexibility I had told the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> was a minimal prerequisite; I said
                            that insofar as the three essential requirements for us—nationalization
                            of equity including debts, honoring the notes issued for the 51 percent
                            and the final <pb n="275" facs="0315" xml:id="pg_275"/>package of price,
                            term and interest—the first two were, according to legal opinion
                            provided us by Chilean and US lawyers, not assured in the
                            Senate-approved legislation. <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1"
                                >Letelier</persName> sought at first to argue that the first point
                            was clear in the bill but then admitted it could be further clarified in
                            its passage thru the House; as for the second point, he said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> now had the power to
                            recognize all or part of the promissory notes for the 51 percent and
                            that this would depend on the final negotiation in which the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would of course be very involved.</p>
                        <p>3. To this last remark I reasserted our desire to remain out of the
                            negotiations, observing that my arguments in favor of “flexibility” had
                            been designed to permit peaceful direct settlements between companies
                            and <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>. I did not pursue his assertion
                            that my involvement would be indispensable; it has been increasingly
                            obvious that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> wishes to
                            utilize the copper and iron negotiations in order to bargain with the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and that he hopes to lever
                            promises, if not earlier commitments, of credits from the US as part of
                            the overall package of a settlement. Put another way, he is, I am
                            confident, more persuaded today that a dry-up of credits that would
                            include the <gloss target="#t_IBRD_1">IBRD</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_BID_1">BID</gloss> and perhaps European financiers in
                            addition to the Ex-Im and American private capital would have political
                            and economic implications of such gravity that he would not lightly risk
                            treading that dollar desert.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> and I shadow-boxed
                            around this question. He echoed at every available opportunity <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s public assertions that the
                            copper measures were not directed against the US. My reply was that
                            there were several elements of seeming discrimination, starting with the
                            inclusion of Andina and Exotica. I reviewed the Andina case and heard an
                            admission by <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> that he
                            had not been aware of the facts. His argument was that Andina was
                            “almost” Gran Mineria and therefore had to be included as could be seen
                            from the will of the Chilean people expressed in the Senate vote. Aside
                            from giving tonnages, projections, profitability and comparisons with
                            the French and German owned mines, I said it was self-evident that no
                            Chilean legislator in the extant political environment was willing to
                            protest an action against a US company that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> proposed. The issue was why the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> had included companies that had not
                            yet had profits and that would have production in 1971 well below non-US
                            mines with high profitability, a long history of exploitation and a low
                            risk investment in technology. When I said that the treatment given to
                            Cerro (Andina) was so punitive that it might have an adverse impact on
                            US sources of capital, <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName>
                            argued that the Ex-Im Bank could if it wished take a different tack and
                            that a high degree of prudence would be interpreted as reflecting a
                            political rather than a banking outlook. I took issue with these
                            insinuations. If he wished to introduce political factors, I asked what
                            were Cerro and Anaconda to conclude from the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss>’s refusal to cooperate <pb n="276" facs="0316"
                                xml:id="pg_276"/>in any manner to resolve the immediate short-term
                            financing problems of Andina and Exotica. In answer to his questions I
                            provided the details of these two pressing situations and of the
                            inflexible attitudes of Codelco and the Central Bank; did the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> wish to force the closing of these
                            mines and thereby have a justification for interventors assuming the
                            management, I asked; if they did, the companies could then default on
                            their Ex-Im loans and provoke a call for full payment by that
                            institution. <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> argued
                            that the companies should continue to handle their financing as in the
                            past. However he agreed finally that it was unrealistic to expect the
                            companies to put fresh non-guaranteed capital into Chile with the
                            uncertainty surrounding past invested capital and that a refusal to take
                            realistic account of short-term cash flow problems of the kind
                            encountered by Andina and Exotica could be interpreted in the US in, as
                            he put it, the “wrong way.” He confessed too that the treatment given
                            Cerro when their reps came here to “negotiate” was a poor show,
                            particularly in view of his earlier statement that no negotiations were
                            possible until the Congress had acted. He concluded that Andina would
                            have a chance to make its case with <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> and that the President was very anxious to have
                            good rels with the US which was one of the reasons that <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> was being “rushed” to
                            Washington. (Incidentally he has received invitations from 26 US
                            universities to speak about the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> revolution and the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> obviously anticipates an opportunity to make its case
                            to US opinion in a way that we do not have here; indeed if we sought to
                            make any public case in Chile, we would be battered by a barrage of
                            invective and invention).</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> insisted too that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> would honor all its debts to
                            the Ex-Im and therefore we had no cause for concern. There were two
                            causes for disquiet, I observed. First, other US institutions were
                            involved in the loans to the copper companies and it would be an error
                            to do arithmetical sums that had loans outstanding to Ex-Im equal an
                            acceptable settlement to the companies or to the US; similarly a
                            totalling of <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss> obligations to the
                            copper companies was not equal to an acceptable settlement. Secondly,
                            the law in Congress said that loans to third parties would only be
                            honored insofar as compensation was equal or higher; hence until the
                            final settlement was reached between companies and <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>, if there were one, no banker,
                            including the Ex-Im, had any certainty of receiving payment. Since he
                            had said that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> had total
                            control of the eventual negotiations and that he could choose from zero
                            to 100 on each of the many variables involved, the Ex-Im for bankers’
                            reasons would probably be prudent until it knew just which number the
                            Chilean President would choose.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> would not specify
                            whether the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> would prefer to
                            compensate the companies in copper. He asserted Chile did not have to
                            worry too much about selling its copper despite a temporary softening
                                <pb n="277" facs="0317" xml:id="pg_277"/>of the market. He allowed
                            that copper could offer more flexibility in negotiation than money. He
                            agreed that we should not allow ideology to overshadow the fundamental
                            reality that the sums involved in a copper negotiation if put on an
                            annual basis were comparatively small. However he insisted that
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> had to take
                            political factors into account in an unstated reference to the pressures
                            within the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> from the purists. I had
                            noted that if Chile honored all its obligations and paid compensation on
                            equity from remaining 49 percent, within acceptable periods of time, the
                            differences would probably be no more than $40 million a year than if it
                            paid nothing to anyone except the outstanding 12 year notes given to
                            Anaconda.</p>
                        <p>7. When he said that Matus had been impressed by my constructive spirit
                            re Bethlehem and that <persName corresp="#p_AMC_1">Almeyda</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_TGJ_1">Toha</persName> had also expressed to
                            him their desire to continue talking regularly to me, I ran through the
                            Bethlehem facts and said that I could not fathom what appeared to be
                            different approaches between <gloss target="#t_CAP_1">CAP</gloss>,
                            MinMines, <gloss target="#t_ENAMI_1">ENAMI</gloss> and others. He said
                            cryptically that Matus would get his way and that he wanted to deal with
                            Bethlehem, but he would not go beyond. (On Feb 15, I was called by Matus
                            who invited me to lunch again at <gloss target="#t_CAP_1">CAP</gloss>,
                            Feb 17, with the Minister of Mines. I accepted and expect Bethlehem,
                            Marconi-Flo and copper to be on the docket. Interestingly too, the
                            Chilean media here Feb 17 played <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1"
                                >Letelier</persName>’s gratuitous rebuttal, on his arrival in
                            Washington, of the allegations in the American press about the lack of
                            normal rels between the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and
                            me).</p>
                        <p>8. When I said there would shortly be problems with <gloss

                            of the company. I noted that it appeared to be a pattern for the <gloss

                            that it coveted and that I hoped the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> could work out its problems amicably with that
                            influential enterprise.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> raised with me the
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWF_1">William Buckley</persName> visit,
                            repeating the protest registered with us by the Foreign Ministry earlier
                            in the week and asserting that the President was “furious” with this
                            misuse of a diplomatic passport. <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1"
                                >Letelier</persName> noted too that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> was aware that I had seen <persName corresp="#p_BWF_1"
                                >Buckley</persName>. To this he linked the <gloss target="#t_AP_1"
                                >AP</gloss>’s reporting in Chile of what <hi rend="italic">Asahi

                                >CAP</gloss> negotiations with Nippon Steel in Tokyo, the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>’s conclusion being that a US news
                            agency “had deliberately ignored what seven other Tokyo newspapers had
                            reported” while selecting the one totally inventive report. Some in the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> felt, he said, that a

                            been exposed.</p>
                        <p>10. In reply I repeated what we had told the <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1"
                                >FonMin</gloss> re <persName corresp="#p_BWF_1">Buckley</persName>
                            and asked <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> if we had
                            engaged in any duplicity since I had made certain that the President’s
                            office and all other persons in the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                            and the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> sought by <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWF_1">Buckley</persName> had known prior to <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWF_1">Buckley</persName>’s arrival that he <pb n="278"
                                facs="0318" xml:id="pg_278"/>was coming as a journalist. Moreover
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWF_1">Buckley</persName>’s activities and
                            views well known to Chilean Emb in Wash. <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1"
                                >Letelier</persName> agreed that mine was a fair position, then he
                            said we had to take into account the sensibilities here. I said that
                            there were Americans who believed that Chileans expected the entire US
                            to cater to their sensibilities while remaining immune to anyone else’s.
                            What were we to make of the Hernandez Parker inventions about the

                            my govt to conclude that these fabrications were deliberately planted to
                            create a misrepresentation of the US? <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1"
                                >Letelier</persName> said the story was a complete invention; it was
                            his job to try to explain the diversity of a free US press but yet he
                            wondered why the <gloss target="#t_AP_1">AP</gloss> had selected the one
                            harmful-to-Chile report from among so many. I suggested he ask the
                                <gloss target="#t_AP_1">AP</gloss> but that my guess would be that
                            no one in the <gloss target="#t_AP_1">AP</gloss> office had thought of
                            anything more than the man-bites-dog measurement of news. If he wished,
                            I would take to the Foreign Ministry every false story that impugned the
                            US and its reps that appeared here daily in media controlled by the
                            parties that comprised the govt; I had not done so because we certainly
                            would not get as fair a hearing in the media of his country as he
                            certainly would in ours and because there were too many more important
                            issues on which to concentrate our respective efforts. It was for the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> to affirm or deny reports of
                            what its President had said to a US official representative; if it chose
                            to say nothing, we could be forced to draw our own conclusions.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>—Would be consistent with policies in the economic area, i.e., no new

                        <p>—Would be a clear signal of disapproval of the <persName

                        <p>—Would be the most defensible course of action in the press or Congress,
                            in that we would not be providing any military equipment to a Marxist
                            Anti-US government.</p>

                            tenuous relations with them while there is still a possibility they

                        <p>—Could cause retaliatory action such as expulsion of the Military

                            the real possibility that in the flush of resentment they would accept
                            Soviet offers. The present Chilean military inventory is obsolescent,
                            and replacement requirements will be large. The source of these
                            replacements will have a major influence on the Chilean Armed

                        <p>—Although the amount is not significant; it would signify to the Chilean

                        <p>—Would be reasonably consistent with economic policy, in that minor
                            credit for spare parts for equipment already on hand is analogous to
                            completion of ongoing development loans.</p>

                        <p>—Although not as abrupt an action as Option 1, it is unlikely that this
                            response would be acceptable to the Chilean military, with possible
                            resultant disadvantages stated in Option 1.</p>

                        <p>Forty M–41 tanks, funded under <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>
                            credit, were purchased by Chile in <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss>
                            1969. Twenty of these tanks have been delivered. The remaining twenty
                            were scheduled for delivery by 15 January 1971.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_SRG_1">SRG</gloss>, on 19 November 1970, decided to
                            hold in abeyance the delivery of the 20 tanks scheduled for January;
                            this decision to be reviewed at a later date.</p>
                        <p>The tanks are presently being held in storage in the U.S. and are
                            incurring storage charges. In the meantime, the Chileans are promptly
                            meeting the <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credit semi-annual
                            repayment schedule, the last payment made in January 1971.</p>
                        <p>Both <gloss target="#t_USCINCSO_1">USCINCSO</gloss> and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> have now recommended
                            release of the remaining tanks to Chile. While the modest delay to date
                            in delivering the tanks has not yet aroused an adverse reaction,
                            prolongation would soon provide ammunition for charges of U.S. bad faith
                            and unreliability at a critical time when continued association with the
                            U.S. is likely to be under consideration within the Chilean
                            military.</p>
                        <p>While delivery of the tanks to Chile might give some of our friends in
                            Latin America (particularly Argentina) reason for concern, our
                            Ambassadors should be able to assuage such concern by explaining the
                            reasons for our decision, i.e.: 1) to strengthen our influence with the
                            Chilean military services and thus attempt to harden resistance to
                            Communist domination of Chile; 2) increase Chilean dependence on U.S.
                            sources of supply for spares; and 3) preempt Communist suppliers of
                            equipment from an association with the Chilean military services.</p>
                        <p>Recommend that the <gloss target="#t_SRG_1">SRG</gloss> approve delivery
                            of the 20 remaining M–41 tanks to Chile.</p>

                            authorized for electoral support of the Christian Democratic Party

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Background on Elections</p>
                        <p>During February, the Marxist government of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Salvador Allende</persName> launched a massive drive to recruit
                            electoral support for Popular Unity (<gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>)
                            parties, particularly among lower income groups. The Communist Party’s
                            municipal election effort has been especially impressive. The
                            Communists, who now have access to government spoils, have been spending
                            unprecedented sums of money to recruit and pay party organizers, roving
                            entertainment groups and sign painters to supplement the efforts of
                            their local candidates. In addition, the Communists are participating in
                                <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> efforts to recruit and organize
                            the Popular Unity Committees (C<gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>) which
                            serve as clearing houses for government patronage and favors (ranging
                            from handing out powdered milk to helping <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss> loyalists get government jobs) and which are also active
                            in the election campaign. C<gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> activity
                            is particularly intense in areas where the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> continues to control community organizations called
                            Neighborhood Committees created under the Frei administration. The
                                <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> has been very successful in
                            registering the 18–21 years old who will be voting in April for the
                            first time. In late February President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> told a political associate that he feared the
                                <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> would only receive about 47% of
                            the total vote, and that if his calculations are correct the <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> will have a much harder task in
                            justifying the acceleration of its program <pb n="284" facs="0324"
                                xml:id="pg_284"/>than it would if the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss> were to receive more than 50%. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> also said he had not paid
                            sufficient attention to the elections, blaming this on his preoccupation
                            with organizing the new government. Despite <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s fears, the majority opinion of Chilean
                            politicians is that the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> will gain
                            substantially in the municipal elections and that his government may
                            even attract a majority of the voters. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> estimated on 5 March that the
                            Communist Party will poll around 20% of the vote, the Socialist Party
                            (including its various splinter groups) about 18% and the Radical Party
                            upwards of 10%. Considering that the other three members of the
                            coalition will pick up something, this is not a very encouraging
                            assessment, but it underscores the need to bolster the opposition
                            parties and to help them conduct electoral campaigns which will maintain
                            the morale of their followers and evidence their continuing
                            vitality.</p>

                        <p>The overall campaign strategy of the <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss>
                            is to build its image as a party of strength, determination and will to

                            Communists. Its principal propaganda thrust is embodied in its electoral
                            slogan “Pongase firme Junto a Un Partido Firme—El Partido Nacional” (Put
                            Yourself Firmly Behind a Strong Party—The National Party). While the

                                >UP</gloss> as its main enemy, it continues its long-standing
                            rivalry with the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>, which it hopes to
                            displace as the strongest single party in Chile. As a result of Agency

                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>, but its attacks on the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> have not ended completely. The <gloss
                                target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss> hopes to gain about 25% of the vote,
                            some of which will be at the expense of the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss> sees unemployment as one of the
                            most important national issues of the campaign, and much of its radio
                            advertising is pegged to unemployment and to the loss of individual
                            liberties under the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> regime. The
                            National Party directorate has assumed responsibility for setting the
                            tone of the campaign, for radio advertising, for the printing of a
                            limited number of electoral posters for each <gloss target="#t_PN_1"
                                >PN</gloss> candidate, and for fund raising. The party is engaged in
                            a general get-out-the-vote campaign with a special appeal to women,

                            This small party is reluctant to assume responsibility for managing a

                            the party plans to purchase campaign time on several major radio
                            networks, and will defer its decision regarding purchase of the station
                            until after the election.</p>

                            Ovalle’s withdrawal is, however, unlikely unless opposition leaders are

                            opposition has found neither the formula nor the backing for coordinated
                            action against him on most issues; the government avoids a showdown when
                            it anticipates effective legislative opposition and seeks other ways to
                            gain its political and economic ends. Indications of plotting against

                            and El Salvador mines on the grounds of “irregularities” in management.
                            Labor unrest and inefficiency are probably the cause of the production
                            decreases at several copper mines, but the government puts the blame on
                            the US companies which retain minority interest in them. Chile is taking
                            over the world marketing of most of its copper production on 1 April.

                            program of agrarian reform. The rationale held true for the behavior of

                            US companies facing nationalization. This will now be a factor in

                            this month re-emphasized the line that Chile wants good relations with
                            “the most powerful nation in the hemisphere,” but on Chile’s terms. He
                            added that he knew his comments, both positive and negative, would be
                            weighed and analyzed in Washington.</p>

                            has been interpreted by many Chileans as insulting to the president and
                            the nation, an impression encouraged by the government-influenced press.
                            In other matters the oversensitivity that long has distorted the Chilean
                            interpretation of US actions appears to have become almost
                            obsessive.</p>

                            Chilean efforts to retain as strong economic ties as possible with both
                            areas appear to be effective. On 15 March the president of Sumitomo Bank
                            of Tokyo received personal assurances from President <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> of his interest in closer

                            reported. The program involves cooperation of Chilean police and armed

                        <p>On 4 April some three million Chilean voters will go to the polls to
                            elect 1,653 municipal councilmen. In addition, the 10th Senatorial
                            district will elect one Senator to fill the seat vacated by President
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. Despite
                            disclaimers, both the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            government and the political opposition generally regard the election as
                            a plebiscite. Most observers, including the U.S. Embassy, believe that
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s Popular Unity
                                (<gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>) coalition will receive a
                            minimum of 44% and a maximum of 54% of the popular vote. Most current
                            estimates are that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> will
                            not fall significantly below 50%, and that he may well receive the
                            absolute majority he seeks. Individual opposition parties are
                            campaigning strongly, but distrust, competition and even hatred between
                            these parties continues to be a basic problem even though all three
                            claim to be aware of the gravity of the electoral issues involved. The
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> has been particularly effective
                            in exploiting the “Copper Scandal”, charging that high government
                            officials are implicated in illegal copper sales deals which the
                            government then tried to cover up by inventing stories about an
                            international conspiracy to depress the market price of copper. In spite
                            of this scandal, which has tarnished the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss>’s revolutionary image, Chilean voters generally appear
                            apathetic and inclined to view <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> as a father-figure who will be able to control
                            the Communist and extremist forces within his government coalition.</p>

                            loss of personal liberties and political freedom, representing the

                            and traditional Chilean institutions. The party is doing a good job of
                            publicizing rural unrest and campaign clashes and violence, and has also
                            been emphasizing unemployment and the economic chaos which is already
                            leading to shortages of basic consumer items. The “Copper Scandal” is
                            being fully dramatized and exploited but preoccupation with this issue
                            led to a Party decision not to cooperate with the <gloss

                            even the vote level it achieved in the presidential campaign. The

                            emphasized on many occasions his desire for “the best relations” with
                            the US, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has now told the

                            me, at any rate, his point was very clear. After stating that he was not
                            motivated by any revanchist spirit, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> declared:</p>
                        <p>Qte We are ready to talk. It is clear that this conversation is
                            strengthened when the government has the legal instruments that permit
                            it to do so in better conditions because it represents the will of the
                            people. This is the case with the constitutional reform to nationalize
                            the copper mines. But, logically, once the modification of the
                            constitution is realized, we shall talk with the representatives of the
                            copper mines (sic). We do not wish to usurp anything from anyone. But
                            neither do we wish to give windfalls or advantages to anyone. First the
                            interest of Chile, second the interest of Chile and third the interest
                            of Chile. I should tell you, for example, in response to a question put
                            by a correspondent representing a North American paper, that
                            conversations with the representatives of Guggenheim are underway to
                            arrive at an accord concerning the bonds issued by Corfo when the (mixed
                            nitrate company) Soquimich was formed. Well, this would signify a
                            payment of a determined number of millions of dollars in a term of 15 to
                            18 <pb n="304" facs="0344" xml:id="pg_304"/>years. We have launched
                            conversations and I believe that we shall arrive at an accord and this
                            accord will be made known very quickly and that it will mean that
                            one-third or one-fourth will be paid in cash. It is beneficial to the
                            representatives of Guggenheim and is beneficial for the popular
                            government which is demonstrating that a dialogue carried out clearly
                            and without prejudice permits the attainment of solutions and that with
                            it, we shall be taking another step towards a fundamental wealth such as
                            nitrate, plus iron, plus copper. Unqte.</p>
                        <p>3. As in his previous public utterances on the subject, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is responding directly to the
                            points made earlier to his ministers or such quasi-ministers as <gloss
                                target="#t_CAP_1">CAP</gloss>’s Matus. He is responsive to arguments
                            that are commonsensical from a Chilean analysis of its situation, that
                            are forthright in presentation yet reasonable in formulation and
                            sensitive to Chilean preoccupations. What has impressed me is the speed
                            with which <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> provides his
                            answers to questions put in private, in this case as in all previous
                            instances, within a few days time.</p>
                        <p>4. Another response of his that emanated from my conversations with
                                <persName corresp="#p_AMC_1">Almeyda</persName> April 2 and March 29
                            has occurred in the copper bill itself. While the legalistic caveats are
                            still in force, it is a considerable step forward to have the Congress
                            insinuate that the 51 percent accords will be respected (Santiago 1921).
                            This move towards resolution of a fundamental issue was, I would hazard
                            the guess, not merely the consequence of a <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> initiative but of an implicit understanding between the
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> and the govt. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AMC_1">Almeyda</persName> understood that I was telling
                            Washington that I had considered the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                            >UP</gloss>’s pre-election opposition to the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> amendment to be a breach of faith with me in view of
                            the understanding that I had had with the MinMines Cantuarias re
                            Bethlehem. Thus the two major elements of a copper settlement,
                            recognition by the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> of third party
                            debts and of its 51 percent commitments, are shaping up well, whatever
                            the legal loopholes may still be.</p>
                        <p>5. Still another fulfillment of a promise made to me by the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> has materialized in the form of
                            negotiations between Andina and the govt. Thus far the conversations
                            have been taking place at an extra-official level that are preparatory
                            in nature for formal talks I would expect to begin very shortly between
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and Cerro. Andina’s president
                                <persName corresp="#p_FSC_1">Figueroa</persName> came to the
                            residence over the weekend to “congratulate” me on the changes made by
                            the House in the legislation, to ask how it was done and to lament his
                            failure to gain from that same body the elimination of Andina from the
                            bill. He confessed that he had gone against my suggestions by putting
                            the weight of Andina’s effort on his impossible aspiration for
                            exclusion, while deliberately foot-dragging the direct negotiations. Now
                            that he recognizes his lobbying with the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss> was futile,
                            he was won acceptance from Cerro to accelerate immediately (today) the
                            real-world direct negotiations.</p>
                        <pb n="305" facs="0345" xml:id="pg_305"/>
                        <p>Thus far these talks have been carried out by his general counsel, Puga,
                            with Andina’s Communist board member Farru. The parameters of term for
                            full compensation of Cerro’s equity and debt have been adumbrated (a
                            minimum of seven years, a maximum of 15); sales of copper, technical
                            assistance, acceleration of the so-called “U” subordinated obligations
                            and other topics have been considered by the two negotiators, neither of
                            which has authority to commit his principals and thus not worthy of
                            detailing here. But since <persName corresp="#p_AMC_1"
                                >Almeyda</persName>, Cantuarias and others have pointedly asked me
                            at social occasions if matters were not progressing with Andina, the
                            point being to stress their fulfillment of a pledge, I assume the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> is authorizing each point advanced by
                            their unofficial rep and that Cerro reps will soon arrive.</p>
                        <p>6. I have always regarded, as Dept aware, Andina as special case within
                            the very special copper theme. There was no reason to doubt that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> had accepted the arguments
                            articulated at my first lunch with Cantuarias months ago and that it
                            would move to prove its bona fides with us and with the international
                            community in relatively timely fashion. Nonetheless, Andina is an
                            important building block in the construction of a solid structure, the
                            apex of which is formed by Kennecott, Anaconda and <gloss
                                target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss>. The sooner an Andina settlement can
                            be reached, the better I believe it will be for those three companies
                            and for overall US interests.</p>
                        <p>7. There is a legitimate question as to whether the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> shares this view of timing. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s language (para 2 above)
                            could be taken literally to mean that he does not wish to start talks
                            with Kennecott and Anaconda until Congress completes its action on the
                            bill. Final enactment by the joint session only comes after the
                            legislation has been approved finally by each house and after a 60-day
                            cooling-off period. It is at that time that the President receives the
                            bill for consideration of his additive, substitutive, suppressive vetos
                            or his signature into law. Thus a literal interpretation would signify a
                            negotiating period of Anaconda and Kennecott in August or September. I
                            am inclined to believe the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> would be
                            willing to launch talks as soon as the Andina negotiations are completed
                            and a final legislative text has been approved by each of the two
                            houses. That could mean early May.</p>
                        <p>8. In ordinary personal circumstances, I would seek to impel such
                            acceleration without hesitation. The longer that Anaconda’s and
                            Kennecott’s properties are legally managed by those two companies, the
                            more they will run into the inevitable problems of short-term financing,
                            Chilean personnel placement, production difficulties; thus the greater
                            will be the opportunities for serious misunderstanding, for blaming
                            foreign devils, for debilitating mistrust. Also, I would anticipate that
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would in the interim
                            be seeking financial commitments of one kind or another in the US from
                            private or public sources or from inter<pb n="306" facs="0346"
                                xml:id="pg_306"/>national institutions in which the US has some
                            influence. Whereas I have believed a resolution of the problems
                            involving US companies should be our overriding priority, a delay could
                            obfuscate this goal and lead willy-nilly to damaging interactions of
                            issues that we should strive to keep separate. When and if we settle the
                                <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> and copper problems, a
                            case-by-case examination of Chilean requests for credits would be
                            justified. But to stumble into a kind of global quid pro quo negotiation
                            would convert dialogue into delirium for both govts. For the moment, I
                            intend to seek information on these matters:</p>
                        <p>A. Is <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> prepared to
                            negotiate earlier or later re Kennecott and Anaconda?</p>
                        <p>B. Is there any prospect for further legislative improvements in the
                            Senate where <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_AAP_1">Aylwin</persName> has been considering further
                            amendments? What effect would it have on timing?</p>
                        <p>C. Can the copper companies’ discomfort with their management contract
                            responsibilities offer an opportunity to convert these into consultancy
                            arrangements and at the same time be the basis for broader
                            negotiations?</p>

                                Foreign Minister of Chile</item>

                        <p>The Secretary opened by saying that in the speech he had delivered on the
                            previous day, he had given an outline of U.S. policy towards Latin
                            America: the U.S. wanted to cooperate and have good relations with any
                            Latin American country which felt the same way. He said that the Foreign
                            Minister represented a new government, which was perhaps still charting
                            its course, but that he would appreciate any indication as to what
                            Chile’s policy towards the U.S. was going to be.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister replied that his government had no intention of
                            doing or saying anything that might lead to a deterioration in the good
                            relations it had with the U.S. There would inevitably come a time when
                            discussions would be necessary on specific issues, such as the copper
                            mines, and his government’s intention was to strive to maintain a
                            framework of good relations within which such specific issues might be
                            discussed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the U.S. also wanted to maintain good relations
                            with Chile. It indeed maintained very friendly relations with several
                            socialist countries, and in fact, these relations were better than those
                            existing between these countries and the Soviet Union. He expected
                            differences to arise between the U.S. and Chile, but hoped that this
                            would not become an anti-American policy on the part of the Chilean
                            Government. He said that U.S. policy with respect to Chile would depend
                            on whether a) the U.S. concluded that the Chilean Government had
                            embarked on an anti-American course and b) that judgment would be based
                            both on what Chile said but more importantly on its actions.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that Chile disagreed with some U.S. policies,
                            e.g. Vietnam, and others, but this reflected a difference of opinion and
                            no anti-American sentiment. He was sure that the U.S. disagreed with,
                            for example, Chile’s decision to recognize the People’s Republic of
                            China, but that he did not interpret this as anti-Chilean feeling.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked in the light of the Foreign Ministers <gloss
                                target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> speech whether Chile would prefer to
                            have an <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> without the U.S.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister replied that on the contrary, the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> could become a very useful forum for
                            constructive dialogue between Latin America on the one hand, and the
                            U.S. on the other. It would make no sense to speak of having an <gloss
                                target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> without the U.S. as a member, the
                            Foreign Minister said.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stressed that the U.S. did not expect its friends to always
                            agree with it, or to refrain from criticisms, but that the tone and
                            intent of the criticisms were of paramount importance.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that his Government had proved that it had no
                            intention of taking advantage of events to do or say things that would
                            lead to a deterioration in relations. Proof of this attitude was the
                            Chilean Government’s calm reaction to the dismantling of the Easter <pb
                                n="308" facs="0348" xml:id="pg_308"/>Island installations and to the
                            cancellation of the visit of the U.S.S. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Enterprise.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that U.S. experience in dealing with socialist
                            governments had shown that they spoke the same language ideologically.
                            The difference between the various socialist countries lay in their
                            actions. Both Chile and the U.S. would have to judge each other in the
                            light of the actions taken by each, leaving ideological considerations
                            to one side. It was interesting to note that several long-established
                            socialist countries of Eastern Europe had approached the U.S. in the
                            quest of increased contacts and investments, saying that the lack of
                            these contacts and investments was the reason why their systems had not
                            worked better.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister replied that his Government was not opposed to
                            foreign investments as such. The copper mining industry was in a
                            separate category. He saw no contradiction between Chilean state
                            ownership of the mines and new American investments, provided the latter
                            were mixed in nature, and that the Chilean Government retained control
                            of the “nucleus” of the Chilean economy.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out as he had in his <gloss target="#t_OAS_1"
                                >OAS</gloss> speech that the U.S. was not promoting U.S. private
                            investment in countries that did not want it. What was objectionable was
                            for a country to request private investment and then later to criticize
                            the U.S. for doing what it had been requested to do.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the Secretary said that complete frankness was to be
                            essential in communications between the U.S. and Chile, since frankness
                            was the only way in which inevitable differences could be smoothed over.
                            He suggested the advisability of communicating over differences in such
                            a way as to avoid their being aired in the press.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister expressed his agreement with this approach, and
                            advised the Secretary to read his address to the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> General Assembly carefully, since it
                            outlined Chile’s policies clearly.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister referred to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1"
                                >Letelier</persName>’s invitation to the Secretary to visit Chile
                            and reaffirmed that invitation to visit at an opportune time.</p>

                            parties would fare well in the municipal elections, even though his
                            Popular Unity (<gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>) coalition failed by a
                            hair to capture their coveted popular majority of 50%. Government
                            parties collectively (including the splinter Socialist <gloss

                            not a member of the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>) won 49.74% of
                            the vote while the opposition (including independent candidates)
                            obtained 48.90%. The remaining 1.36% of the vote comprised blank or
                            voided ballots. An official printed bulletin issued by the Chilean
                            Ministry of Interior excludes the independent, blank and voided ballots,
                            allots each party higher percentages and shows the <gloss

                            being contested by opposition parties.</p>
                        <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s authority within the

                            elections, as was expected, and he has already warned the opposition
                            that he will seek approval of his policies by plebiscite if opposition
                            congressmen try to block his legislation. The opposition, however, has
                            regained its confidence and now has both the will and the ability to
                            resist because they, as does <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"

                            because the system will continue as it has so far.” Opposition parties
                            will continue to try to split the Radicals away from the <gloss

                        <p>There is no doubt that the April elections were held at a time most

                            ahead. As stated before, the election results have restored the

                        <p>In January 1971, when the Committee authorized financial support of
                            Chilean opposition parties for the April municipal elections [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] it was widely
                            accepted that the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> might well achieve
                            its goal of a popular electoral majority; with most, it was a question
                            of how fine a majority. That prospect made it important that the
                            opposition parties be enabled “to make a vigorous electoral effort to
                            maintain the morale of their supporters, evidence party vitality, and
                            strengthen those factions within their respective parties which are
                            willing to make a united effort to maintain democratic freedoms”. At
                            least in Chilean eyes, these objectives have all been achieved.
                            Specifically, the fruits of U.S. Government financial assistance have
                            been:</p>

                            popular majority he sought. He will now have to reconsider his concept

                            />through revolutionary programs since he cannot be sure of winning the
                            support he needs. He has already done so in the case of his much
                            publicized desire for a unicameral congress.</p>

                            society (the monied and privileged, many of whom were prepared to leave

                            in the country. They are encouraged not only by the results of the
                            election but by the demonstrated willingness of the opposition parties
                            to fight.</p>
                        <p>—The opposition parties have regained their confidence and have both the

                            have one problem with an ambassador, which you may have to step in to.
                            It’s <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>, sir. He’s just
                            written you a long letter complaining bitterly about his

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: By, essentially,

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Second—well, it’s—he
                            says he’s tried to carry out his orders faithfully, and he’s taking a
                            beating as a result of it. [William F.] <persName corresp="#p_BWF_1"
                                >Buckley</persName>, who was down there to see him, has written us a

                            the money, and that he has a hell of a lot of information of what we did
                            down there. Bill is furious with him for something he did—for

                            the State Department—and he’s being tough. But I hold no brief for him
                            except that I think we ought to keep him employed until after
                            election—</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yeah. He just knows
                            too damn much. He’s emotionally highly unstable.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: I agree with you. I think
                            it’s a problem that—what the hell are you going to do with him when he
                            gets out and starts writing his books?</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’d make him an
                            ambassador somewhere.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: You mean move him out of

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, he is being
                            moved out of there. That’s already decided—out of Chile. It’s already
                            been announced. That can’t be reversed. And I tried. And he’s an
                            unstable guy. I don’t—I don’t like him particularly. In fact, I don’t
                            like him, period.</p>

                        <p>1. At Carabinero anniversary celebration afternoon April 27, Min Interior
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGJ_1">Toha</persName> took me aside to say
                            President wished me to come to his home evening May 3. Later <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> came over to me to repeat this
                            message to which I replied that happily I did not need to bring a
                            pingpong racquet. (Meeting would be unpublicized since those are ground
                            rules I specified long ago with <persName corresp="#p_TGJ_1"
                                >Toha</persName>.)</p>
                        <p>2. Aside from planning an agenda for this meeting (on which addressee
                            inputs invited) I would deduce that <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel
                                Castro</persName> is either not going to be in Chile Monday night or
                            that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> wishes me to
                            believe he won’t. It is also conceivable that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> believes Edward the bald would
                            be an appropriate act to follow Fidel the bearded.</p>
                        <p>3. I have talked in the past 24 hours to three persons of reasonable
                            objectivity who have seen <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> the past fortnight. Aside from specifics that
                            can be included in other reporting, I am struck by their deduction that
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is reverting to form
                            in personal habit. He is drinking heavily; he is nocturnally engaged in
                            the state of his affairs; he is not dealing in a serious manner with
                            precise affairs of state. Twice he received visitors in his pajamas,
                            covered a la Napoleon with a luxurious cape of blue that did not clash
                            with a complexion that revealed his recent indulgences.</p>
                        <p>4. In all conversations, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            plays the tune his visitors wish to hear. In the past fortnight he has
                            said to one, for example, that Min Agriculture <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJ_1">Chonchol</persName> must go, to another that many
                            wished to see <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Chonchol</persName> removed
                            but who could replace him; and to a third that removal would provoke
                            more problems than it would resolve. To those who are willing to accept
                            socialism in Chile in a form approximating the Swedish or Austrian
                            models, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> expounds at
                            length on his preoccupation with the economy, employing the word
                            “crisis” over and over and blaming undisciplined “functionaries” for
                            general and specific problems. He has a flair for the dramatic, as I
                            have noted before, that he displayed in one of these recent interviews,
                            by suddenly telephoning <pb n="317" facs="0357" xml:id="pg_317"/>the
                            head of the state railways, an engineer who happens to be named
                                <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName>, and declaimed
                            (more or less textually): “Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel
                                Castro</persName>, I hear that you have scheduled a train of 12
                            carriages plus dining and sleeping cars to transport (so many) hundreds
                            of your employees to a demonstration at Salta. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName>, you are an engineer, you
                            know something about numbers, you must then know what the costs are. The
                            President of the Republic expects you to do your sums in a professional
                            manner.” Receiver then slammed down.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is a brilliant
                            politician who understands Chile and Chileans but he has only a
                            half-grasp of his true economic problems. To achieve greater employment,
                            less decapitalization in all significant sectors and less of a loss of
                            skilled technicians, he must take effective corrective actions soon.
                            Soothings of each group is his style but the indigenous professionals
                            require substance to invest in the future. From my other conversations
                            the past 24 hours with Minister Economy <persName corresp="#p_VBP_1"
                                >Vuskovic</persName>, his Deputy Garreton, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TGJ_1">Toha</persName> and others, I would venture the
                            guess that they will try to move in a pragmatic direction with the
                            active support of the Communists. Indeed it is their economic fears upon
                            which I have been playing in my efforts to arrange acceptable deals for
                            US companies. Of course, for us, this is a transitional negotiation
                            period, as for Chileans, I repeat what I reported in Santiago 2236 prior
                            to talking to recent <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            visitors: he has neither the temperament nor the intellectual experience
                            to sustain systematic management and he has internal contradictions both
                            as to his person and his government that will not be easily
                            reconciled.</p>

                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s invitation to have
                            drinks with him came after I had sidestepped suggestions from him and
                            from his ministers that I should request an audience. It was my
                            judgement that a structure of viable understanding had first to be
                            established by events rather than words. I did not wish to hear pious
                            generalities or dissemblings that might make page one of the <hi
                                rend="italic">New York Times</hi> but had no significance for our
                            real problems; nor did I wish to utilize a first contact to recite
                            well-worn homilies on US investment. I believed that by operating
                            through select intermediaries, specifically Interior Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_TGJ_1">Toha</persName>, Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_AMC_1">Almeyda</persName>, and subsequently Carlos
                            Matus, we could mutually establish the rhythm of a normal relationship
                            and the lyrics of pragmatic arrangements that would key <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s ear to specific chords or
                            discords.</p>
                        <p>A. Moreover, these channels afforded a screen of protection from the
                            “package” approach that intrudes almost inevitably in such
                            situations—the temptation to trade off one problem for a package of
                            them, to exchange settlements of immediate issues for aid, trade, or
                            what have you. Since our immediate problems involved American companies,
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> had to concoct eventful signals that
                            could be translated into a language of contracts for those US firms.
                            Then, too, the Unidad Popular experience had to mature sufficiently so
                            that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, as its President,
                            had some specific understanding of his economic challenges and so that
                            his willingness to believe in crude international conspiracies was
                            gradually displaced by a keener awareness of the market laws that govern
                            the standard of living of his people; the law by definition must have
                            the implication of sanction.</p>
                        <p>B. Finally, the Chilean likes to think of himself as the paradigm of
                            astuteness which men of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                            >Allende</persName>’s stripe interpret as getting the other fellow to
                            commit without committing yourself. Being “astuto” is hand-maiden to
                            Chilean “convivencia” and its obverse aversion to confrontation.</p>

                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> did not seem the least
                            put out by my having waited him out. On the contrary, he did not indulge
                            in dramatic posturings nor did he expend much breath on his cliches
                            regarding our relations. He had not gone to his office that day
                            (Monday), the official excuse being that he was at work on his state of
                            the union message for May 21 delivery to Congress; I would say he had
                            celebrated over the weekend his superb politico-forensic performance of
                            May first. Settled into his armchair, drinking steadily throughout the
                            75 minutes (I would reckon eight to ten ounces and it was not his first
                            walk to the well that day), mild of tone and somewhat glazed of eye, he
                            had none of the bantam-cock strut and strum of his public appearances.
                            He fell silent in the presence of his servant whose exit he awaited on
                            three occasions to conclude a statement; perhaps this caution was for
                            effect since it is conceivable that our conversation was being
                            permanently recorded. I would echo the judgement of “superficial” that a
                            recent Polish Communist media commentator made in assessing <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> a fortnight ago to our Embassy
                            in Caracas. And without parroting the description of “liar” that my West
                            German colleague has applied, I would say that truth like the law, free
                            press and other bourgeois values, are instruments <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> measures as contributions to
                            the revolution he avows is imperative for not only Chile but all LDCs. I
                            did not choose to contradict him on many of his blatant mis-affirmations
                            since I wished to use the meeting for the specific purpose of advancing
                            our actual or imminent negotiations.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> provided me with my
                            opening at the outset when he asked “how are things” and I replied that
                            thanks to him, I no longer was running an Embassy but an advisory
                            service for all the US companies he was taking over. I said that I knew
                            he wished to have a frank talk that would serve to ease his problems and
                            therefore wanted him to know what I had on my mind.</p>
                        <p>4. He said he wanted a forthright chat. He repeated in desultory pro
                            forma way that Chile would never be used as a base against the US, that
                            he wanted the best of relations with all people, that he was an admirer
                            of <persName corresp="#p_LGA_1">Lincoln</persName>, that he had visited
                            the US four times, that he knew a great deal more about our country than
                            was suspected.</p>
                        <p>5. I said the Embassy had not only promptly reported all these
                            affirmations but that we had identified him as a convinced socialist, a
                            humanist and an excellent politician with a very deep perception of
                            Chilean characteristics. Nowhere were these qualities more evident than
                            in his May first speech.</p>
                        <p>6. He said he had laid the facts on the line with the Chilean public,
                            that if they did not produce they would pay the price. I commented he
                            had identified the true problem. His problem would fundamentally be
                            management and bureaucratic parochialism that could result in
                            mismanagement. That term did not have ideological significance; rather
                            it <pb n="320" facs="0360" xml:id="pg_320"/>had productive implications.
                            Chile could have the revolution it wished, but if it hoped to be
                            successful it had to take into account the laws of the market place
                            including access to capital, technology and markets; moreover it had to
                            remember that men needed incentives. Management of the country’s
                            resources involved the future of US companies.</p>
                        <p>7. In particular I was concerned by copper since that metal could more
                            than any other commodity affect our relations. He interrupted to say he
                            was prepared to sell as much Chilean copper as the US desired. I said I
                            had assumed that to be the case but that my preoccupations were of a
                            different order. I ran through quickly his Feb 7 and 21 speeches,
                                <persName corresp="#p_VBP_1">Vuskovic</persName>’s remarks re
                            nationalized enterprises to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>P, my
                            ministerial contacts and my relations with Matus and the Bethlehem
                            accord. I said we had been exchanging signals; sometime the initiative
                            came from the Chilean side, sometime from ours. Interests and dignity
                            demanded a clear dialogue to avoid miscalculations and to foment an
                            authentic effort to arrive at solutions acceptable to both parties.</p>
                        <p>8. I noted we had had good reason to be concerned by the original
                            language of the copper bill; there were still parts that if applied
                            could perturb our relations. However, the Cerro talks were underway and
                            I was confident a settlement could be reached. I wished to know if the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> were prepared to enter the
                            second round next week as Cerro expected and I hoped. I also wished to
                            know if he shared my view that a Cerro accord would be another
                            significant block in the structure we had mutually been erecting to
                            permit negotiations promptly to begin with Anaconda and Kennecott. I
                            noted some Chileans had been speculating as to the advantages of
                            awaiting union developments in our copper industry; others thought it
                            would be advantageous to avoid talks in the 60-day cooling-off period
                            and then apply the law unilaterally. I considered such possibilities
                            myopically dangerous. Chile’s chances of achieving an economic success
                            rested first on copper production and secondly on international
                            confidence. The sooner it resolved the copper question, the better for
                            him, the better for us.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> said of course there
                            would be a second round with Cerro. He wanted me to continue my contacts
                            with Matus; they were important. As for the big two, it was nonsense to
                            try to have Chile base its policy on a possible strike in the US mines.
                            The talks with the two companies would begin once there was a Cerro
                            accord and an agreed congressional text. The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> did not wish to be punitive nor provoke problems with
                            any US company; the interests of both parties had to be taken into
                            account. I repeated to him my understanding of the foregoing and he
                            confirmed it.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> then recited the
                            imperatives of socialism for all LatAm. He said he did not expect me to
                            comment as he lashed Brazil for its anti-Chilean posture and for what he
                            said were the irreconcilable forces <pb n="321" facs="0361"
                                xml:id="pg_321"/>fermenting within the country. Doubtless having in
                            mind his success in seating the Cardinal of Chile on his May first
                            platform in the midst of all the visiting Communist dignitaries, he said
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>’s conflict with the Church
                            showed how impossible it was to stem the popular tide and the real
                            aspirations of the people. The military experience in Argentina was
                            another display of futility. Of course, he was a good friend of
                                <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName>, a very close
                            friend, but the Chilean and Cuban situations were distinct. I cut in to
                            say that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> had
                            made the distinction too. He said <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel
                                Castro</persName> had not written him a letter after the elections,
                            advising him on how to deal with the US, but that an intimate friend
                            (presumably his daughter Beatriz) had brought a message from Fidel
                            cautioning <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to take care
                            to try to maintain the best possible relations with the US.</p>
                        <p>11. I said that I was disturbed by the actions of those who sought to
                            depict the US as involved in a conspiracy against Chile. (See
                            forthcoming <gloss target="#t_septel_1">septel</gloss> about my concern
                            re increasing anti-US propaganda in media.) I recalled that when I had
                            gone to <persName corresp="#p_AMC_1">Almeyda</persName> in mid-November
                            of 1970 to formulate the ground-rules for a viable relationship, I had
                            told the <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> that I knew the govt
                            would be making a major effort to link us to the <persName
                                corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName> murder (on which a Cuban
                            movie in circulation here blames the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss>) and similar deeds and that I welcomed the vigor the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> would expend because it would
                            then be satisfied that all the chatter was a canard. However, there was
                            a new line in circulation to the effect that the US was squeezing Chile
                            financially and by sabotage at the mines. Hence I wished to recite the
                            facts:</p>
                        <p>A. There had been no interruption in US commitments of any kind.</p>
                        <p>B. Chile had removed almost all its deposits from the US but American
                            banks had continued to give substantial loans and credits.</p>
                        <p>C. Exim had, contrary to <gloss target="#t_CAP_1">CAP</gloss>’s
                            suspicions, not interfered in expenditure of any approved loan and Matus
                            and <persName corresp="#p_LF_1">Levine</persName> of <gloss
                                target="#t_CAP_1">CAP</gloss> had so told me.</p>
                        <p>D. Aid was continuing to disperse some $30,000,000 in pipeline.</p>
                        <p>E. Two <gloss target="#t_IBRD_1">IBRD</gloss> loans had been approved
                            with US support after <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            inauguration. We had not interfered with the <gloss target="#t_IBRD_1"
                                >IBRD</gloss> program.</p>
                        <p>F. All significant US corporations had continued to work normally after
                            Sept 4, 1970, and had avoided provocations as I had then urged.</p>
                        <p>12. I said I wished to elaborate on this last point since someone had
                            supplied the President with erroneous info for his May first speech.
                            Contrary to his statement that some 240 Anaconda technicians had quit
                            their jobs, the facts were that the total had been 85, that of this
                            number only 43 were Amcits, eight were Chileans and the remainder from
                            other countries. Today 34 of the total were still on the job and would
                            remain if the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> so desired. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> said that was a good idea. I
                            said <pb n="322" facs="0362" xml:id="pg_322"/>the others had left
                            because of mishandling by his functionaries and that in all copper
                            cases, the US technicians, in their own interests, had been making a
                            valiant effort to produce copper. At Teniente, Kennecott had brought in
                            its own technicians to resolve problems artificially created by govt
                            functionaries and had succeeded in raising production to 600 tons a day;
                            at Rio Blanco, production was on target; and in the Anaconda properties
                            there were problems at Exotica but as the name signified, it was a
                            strange ore body that required expert geological and chemical guidance.
                            If Chile wanted it, Anaconda would certainly provide it on a
                            transitional or longer term basis, as would the other companies.
                            Moreover, Anaconda was well advanced in securing $100,000,000 in foreign
                            credits for desperately needed working capital for the year at its joint
                            venture mines (with Central Bank guarantee and with assurance that it
                            would then receive its $18,000,000 in pending dividends). None of this
                            added up to conspiracy.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> who had been nodding
                            his assent then gave me my only surprise. He said that he had a copy of
                            our evacuation plan dated Nov. 25, 1970. I said if he were referring to
                            what every Embassy in the world is required by administrative rules to
                            do—the preparation of plans to evacuate under emergency conditions—it
                            signified nothing. Moreover, I said the date for our Embassy sounded
                            very wrong. Could he have meant an earlier period? No, he said, Nov. 25
                            and if you wish I shall get you a photostat. Can you imagine, he said,
                            in the context of other events, the effect that this document had? I
                            replied it depended upon the meaning people strived or not to put into
                            every event, but that I could assure him it had no rpt no significance
                            and that I was unaware of any such document. Moreover, such a document
                            was not widely distributed. “I have good service, don’t I?” he laughed.
                            (See <gloss target="#t_septel_1">septel</gloss> this matter) I recalled
                            that I had been very careful in what I said to his ministers and to
                            Matus and that I had never indulged in misleading comments. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> said he could so attest since
                            both <persName corresp="#p_TGJ_1">Toha</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_AMC_1">Almeyda</persName> had said I had been scrupulous
                            in sticking to facts that had proved out and that they both had learned
                            to respect me. He added that Djuka Julius, his good friend the editor of
                                <hi rend="italic">Politika</hi> in Belgrade, had also given him the
                            same reading on me.</p>
                        <p>14. He asked why I was leaving. He wished me to know that he had never
                            said a word against me or against President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                >Nixon</persName>. Never. Never. My role in the Bethlehem
                            negotiations had been very appreciated; my contacts with Matus had
                            importance for the Cerro talks. Could I stay long enough to deal with
                            the major copper problem? The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> was
                            in no hurry to see me leave.</p>
                        <p>15. I replied that my departure had nothing to do with policy, that as
                            long as I was here, I would use my good offices to seek to avoid <pb
                                n="323" facs="0363" xml:id="pg_323"/>problems that could complicate
                            our relations. I expressed my appreciation for his confidence.</p>
                        <p>16. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> then brought up the
                                <hi rend="italic">Enterprise</hi> and I rebutted that along lines
                            known to the Dept. He lamented that US Ambassadors had cut themselves
                            off from him, that the last substantive conversation with one was in
                            1958. I offered some reasons but refrained from recalling his rebuff to
                            Amb <persName corresp="#p_DRA_1">Dungan</persName> when he created a
                            cause celebre by handing over his letter to the press.</p>
                        <p>17. I outlined briefly the Ford case and he again agreed, including a
                            specific promise to receive Thursday the visiting executives. No company
                            could be forced to lose money, I said, but Ford wished to stay in Chile
                            if a transitional or long-term alternative could be arranged. If not,
                            they would reluctantly shut down.</p>
                        <p>18. I noted that <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> ’s problem was
                            coming to a head but that Telco President Holmes was handling the matter
                            and I hoped it would not require <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            involvement because of our insurance policy. “A good friend of mine,”
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> said of Holmes.</p>
                        <p>19. Since I had heard visitors arrive some time before, I suggested I
                            leave. He asked if I could dine with him and Matus next week. I accepted
                            with pleasure. He said Chile would pursue a pragmatic course with the US
                            and avoid provocative actions or expressions. Such a policy coincided
                            with my government’s I said. As I left, I greeted the two waiting
                            callers—Central Bank President <persName corresp="#p_ICA_1"
                                >Inostroza</persName> and <gloss target="#t_CAP_1">CAP</gloss>

                            combination that led me to conclude that their theme was the $7,000,000
                            per month deficit of <gloss target="#t_CAP_1">CAP</gloss> because of
                            exchange rate and other <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> policies
                            affecting sales and production. In sum, they may have put the

                        <p>1. On [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] May 1971, [<hi
                                rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] a leader of the Frei wing
                            of the Christian Democratic Party (<gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>)
                            met with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Edward M.
                                Korry</persName> to discuss the party’s outstanding indebtedness

                                lines not declassified</hi>] These debts are in addition to the [<hi

                            owes from the 1970 presidential campaign.</p>
                        <p>2. The <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> fears that unless the
                            short-term debts from the municipal elections are cleared, the party and
                            certain of its leaders will be vulnerable to legal action by the Chilean
                            Government and subject to political blackmail, particularly by the
                            Communist Party. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] top <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> leaders
                            are devoting full time to an attempt to resolve the current financial
                            crisis. <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> parliamentarians have been
                            requested to contribute their government salaries to the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> treasury and have asked the government
                            for advances on their pay to help alleviate the problem. He emphasized
                            the extreme vulnerability, both to individual party leaders and to the
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> collectively, that the bad
                            debts represent. For example, [<hi rend="italic">name not
                                declassified</hi>] has issued some [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount
                                not declassified</hi>] in protested or to-be-protested checks. The
                            extreme left has been publicizing the rubber checks issued by <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> leaders and the preferential treatment
                            they received from the State Bank and private banks in the form of loans
                            without collateral, while low-income Chileans were denied this
                            convenience until the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            Government changed banking policies. The Marxists are not saying these
                            funds were dedicated for political purposes; rather, they wish to create
                            an impression of personal misuse.</p>

                            the April 1971 municipal elections. The Ambassador feels that this
                            underwriting of the repayment of the municipal election debt isolates
                            the <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> debt as a separate

                            can meet on the matter. This deferral would provide sufficient
                            opportunity for the 40 Committee to consider the full implications of
                            the U.S. Government underwriting the entire [<hi rend="italic">dollar

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> has asked Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> for funds to help the Party and
                            some of its leaders to cover about [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>] of short-term debts, [<hi rend="italic">dollar
                                amount not declassified</hi>] of which are already overdue. These
                            debts are in the form of bad checks and letters of credit, and doctored
                            invoices. The Party is attempting to raise funds from its own sources,
                            but with little success thus far. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> and the Station Chief believe
                            that the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> and its leaders are
                            extremely vulnerable to legal action and political blackmail by the
                            extreme left as the debts fall due.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> and the Station Chief
                            therefore have requested approval in principle to cover the entire
                            short-term debt with immediate authority to pass [<hi rend="italic"
                                >dollar amount not declassified</hi>] to the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> to cover those checks already in
                            default. They believe the security risk in introducing these funds is
                            manageable (although <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> believes
                            future funding will be increasingly risky if the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> does not develop additional channels
                            of funding [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>) and I met yesterday to discuss the
                            request. We have agreed to recommend to the 40 Committee immediate
                            approval for the [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>]
                            needed immediately. However, we felt that since there is no immediate
                            operational requirement for the remaining [<hi rend="italic">dollar
                                amount not declassified</hi>] (those debts will fall due in mid-June
                            and subsequently), and because we have some questions about the
                            desirability of covering 100% of the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> debt, we would recommend that we defer approval of the
                            remaining amount so that the 40 Committee can meet and discuss this
                            issue.</p>

                            May 26.</p>
                        <p>1. In interest of speed, following is recap of significant events which
                            will be reported as time becomes available.</p>
                        <p>A. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> met with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MB_1">Bradford Mills</persName> and me for 80 minutes
                            morning May 26. After <persName corresp="#p_MB_1">Mills</persName> made
                                <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss> case, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> spent almost full hour
                            presenting Chilean point of view in cordial yet not very encouraging
                            manner for Kennecott and Anaconda. My view is that meeting was
                            worthwhile, that it represented continuation of dialogue, future of
                            which will require much effort and sophisticated tactics on our part if
                            worst is to be avoided.</p>
                        <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> heard from top Chilean
                            executive of El Teniente, Pedro Campino, yesterday a detailed, candid
                            and objective account of how <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> is
                            running that enterprise into the ground and endangering future of
                            country. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> kept silent
                            throughout, was visibly impressed by facts and terminated meeting by
                            asking that Haldeman come to see him. Haldeman appointment now fixed for
                            May 31.</p>
                        <p>C. Executive Secretary of Fomento Fabril (Chilean equivalent of <gloss
                                target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss>) informed me today that organization’s
                            future president, Orlando Saenz, was convoked by <gloss
                                target="#t_MinEcon_1">MinEcon</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VBP_1">Vuskovic</persName> May 24 to be informed
                            that 200 leading Chilean industrial enterprises would be nationalized
                            within next few weeks. Saenz observed quite accurately to <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBP_1">Vuskovic</persName> that the total number of
                            “industrial enterprises” in Chile was only 200 at the most and that
                            “thousands” of others that <persName corresp="#p_VBP_1"
                                >Vuskovic</persName> mentioned were not industrial enterprises but
                            small workshops.</p>
                        <p>D. During foregoing conversation, the 14 leading textile enterprises of
                            Chile were asked to voluntarily sell out totally at prices fixed by
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>. Because owners did not
                            immediately comply, the 14 (controlling 55 percent of all textile
                            production in the country) were each simultaneously occupied by their
                            workers. The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>, in the name of law
                            and order, then requisitioned the plants to impose de facto
                            nationalization. The same process will be used if necessary in the other
                            186 Chilean en<pb n="328" facs="0368" xml:id="pg_328"/>terprises if
                            their owners do not comprehend the message from the textile
                            industry.</p>
                        <p>E. Although the Communist Party and the leaders of the
                            Communist-dominated <gloss target="#t_CUT_1">CUT</gloss> (Confederation
                            of Trade Unions) had been privately negotiating with Fomento Fabril
                                (<gloss target="#t_FF_1">FF</gloss>) in recent weeks to agree to a
                            change in the labor law that “immobilizes” workers in a plant
                            (preventing their dismissal except for the most extraordinary
                            provocation), MinLabor Oyarce (Communist) yesterday informed <gloss
                                target="#t_FF_1">FF</gloss> there would be no change even though he
                            acknowledged that the <gloss target="#t_PCCh_1">PCCh</gloss> had favored
                            it two weeks ago. Oyarce threatened managers with reprisal if there were
                            any lack of cooperation with <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>.
                                <gloss target="#t_FF_1">FF</gloss> had been seeking a two-year
                            moratorium in the law that would permit hiring to raise production to
                            meet the demand caused by the flood of govt money to the public but
                            wanted to have a legal possibility of layoffs when demand eased.</p>
                        <p>F. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> held a press
                            conference May 25 in which inter alia he said he had intervened
                            personally in the Cerro negotiations and that the basis for an accord
                            existed.</p>
                        <p>G. Am meeting early this afternoon with <gloss target="#t_ITT_1"
                                >ITT</gloss> execs and will tell them that I (rather than disclose
                                <persName corresp="#p_MB_1">Mills</persName>’ presence here) told
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> about the dimensions
                            of <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss>’s coverage of <gloss
                                target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> and its significance to
                            bilaterals.</p>
                        <p>2. Comment: While we shall pursue the settlement of our bilaterals in a
                            pragmatic and I trust productive manner, there should be no doubt in
                            anyone’s mind that the pace of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s road to socialism is being markedly
                            accelerated. The possibility exists that if production remains
                            insufficient, the govt, utilizing the same insidious instruments of
                            so-called legality, will choose a few examples among the (non-Marxist)
                            workers to convince their confreres that <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> will brook no resistance to its production drive. Since
                            there will surely be an effort to blame the US for all that may go wrong
                            with the economic process despite <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s ultra-flattering references to me in his
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_MB_1">Mills</persName>, it is
                            imperative in my view that we manage our affairs in a way that will
                            provide the basis for a sound defense. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"

                                >Mills</persName> that the US was not granting credit. Since it was
                            his monologue on his time and territory, it was neither appropriate nor
                            opportune to challenge this point or others that were far more
                            debatable. While I have scant doubt as to where <persName

                        <p>What should be the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> response to a
                            Chilean request for Eximbank participation in financing the sale of
                            Boeing aircraft to the Chilean government airline?</p>
                        <p rend="center">II. BACKGROUND</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_LAN_1">LAN</gloss>-Chile, the Chilean government
                            airline, has agreed in principle to purchase from the Boeing Aircraft
                            Company one 727–100C, one 707–320C, and one 707–320B for delivery in
                            July 1971, March 1972 and May 1972, respectively. Purchase price
                            including spare parts, support equipment and transitional training,
                            would be approximately $26 million. The transaction would be contingent
                            on an Eximbank seven-year export supplier credit for 40 percent of the
                            purchase price (or about $10.4 million), plus an Eximbank guaranty for
                            an additional 40 percent to be financed by a group of private U.S.
                            banks. The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> would guarantee the 80
                            percent credit portion of the purchase, and <gloss target="#t_LAN_1"
                                >LAN</gloss>-Chile would pay 20 percent down.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> has stated formally to us that
                            it intends to use the 707’s on the proposed <gloss target="#t_LAN_1"
                                >LAN</gloss>-Chile services between Santiago and Frankfurt via
                            Havana and other stops. On the other hand, there is a recent
                            intelligence report which suggests the possibility that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> might consider using other than
                            Eximbank-financed aircraft on its Cuba service.</p>
                        <p>Chilean Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> on
                            May 7 asserted to Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1"
                                >Meyer</persName> that, according to Boeing representatives,
                            Eximbank would find it difficult to proceed with the loan project for
                            reasons “not pertaining to the operation in itself—presumably political
                            considerations.” He further stated (as recorded in the Aide Memoire
                            which he left behind on that occasion) that “in accordance with the
                            purposes many times expressed by the heads of state of the United States
                            as well as <pb n="330" facs="0370" xml:id="pg_330"/>Chile in the sense
                            that both governments wish to maintain the most profitable and friendly
                            relations, the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> does not want to
                            have to face a negative answer or an excessive delay on the part of the
                            Eximbank in a regular operation which has an adequate economic and
                            financial basis advantageous for an important American industry... The
                            operation could strengthen the Chilean purpose to continue using U.S.
                            material and technology in aviation. Thus, the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> would rather have this matter submitted to the highest
                            authorities of the U.S. and have their pronouncement before starting any
                            formal negotiations with the Eximbank.” He went on to request an answer
                            by the end of May.</p>
                        <p>At that time <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> stated that
                            should the proposed deal with Boeing fall through, Chile would turn to
                            Britain for VC–10’s (but not to the Soviet Union) as alternatives to the
                            Boeing. For their part Boeing representatives, perhaps reflecting the
                            severity of conditions in the U.S. aerospace industry, have been
                            unusually aggressive in pursuing this potential sale.</p>
                        <p>On May 17 <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> told
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> in Santiago
                            that Eximbank’s action in this case would be critical to the evolution
                            of U.S.-Chilean relations, and that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> adhered to this view in the strongest fashion,
                            asserting, according to <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1"
                            >Letelier</persName>, that “If they refuse normal trade with us, then
                            how can we interpret their desire as other than hostility?”</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> at the same time
                            cabled that “independent of and prior to <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1"
                                >Letelier</persName>’s raising of the Boeing problem with the
                            Department and with me, we had concluded here that if an acceptable
                            Cerro deal was reached and if we wished to contain the Kennecott and
                            Anaconda problems we would recommend that the Eximbank go forward with
                                <gloss target="#t_LAN_1">LAN</gloss>. We believe the measure stands
                            on its own commercially; we believe that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> will not renege on its Ex-Im commitments; we believe
                            that it will have positive, although not necessarily optimal, impact on
                            the remaining copper negotiations; we believe that in the light of
                            acceptable Cerro, Bethlehem and other similar accords, a negative
                            position would belie our President’s declaration that we are willing to
                            have the kind of relations Chile wishes to have with us; we believe such
                            negative impact would serve to make anti-Communist Chileans more
                            receptive to the populist nationalism which fuels <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s road-to-Socialism strategy;
                            in this latter group we include military as well as civilian
                            elements.”</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The immediate question is the relationship between the decision on the
                            Eximbank credit for aircraft and the imminent negotiations be<pb n="331"
                                facs="0371" xml:id="pg_331"/>tween the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> and the major American copper companies. The <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>, while mindful of the larger policy
                            problems facing the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> on the Eximbank
                            application, probably calculates with respect to the copper negotiations
                            that the $20.8 million in credit and guarantees it is seeking from the
                            Eximbank in this transaction is convincingly modest in comparison with
                            the several hundred million dollars at stake in the copper
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>A negative decision on the Eximbank credit for aircraft would adversely
                            affect the copper negotiations, where U.S. interests of such absolute
                            and symbolic importance are at stake as to make copper the core element
                            in our relations. Such a sequence of developments would acquire a
                            downward momentum with serious and lasting consequences. A favorable
                            disposition toward Eximbank financing for aircraft would by no means
                            assure success in the copper talks, but it would improve the atmosphere
                            both for copper and for other issues ahead in our relations with Chile.
                            (The copper aspect is further discussed later in this paper.)</p>
                        <p>Beyond copper, another aspect touching on the fundamentals of our
                            relations with Chile is the fact that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> quite evidently looks on the Eximbank–Boeing case as a
                            test of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>’s readiness to allow
                            Chile access to capital resources under U.S. influence under any
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Existing policy guidance provides that “the Export-Import Bank should
                            issue no new credits to Chile and should reduce its export guaranties
                            and insurance for Chile gradually and selectively.”</p>
                        <p>There are implications both with respect to the copper negotiations in
                            the shorter run and in the matter of access to U.S. financing in the
                            longer run, which give to the decision on the Eximbank loan for aircraft
                            certain watershed characteristics.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> has chosen circumstances and
                            timing favorable to itself to try to force a quick definition by the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> of its fundamental intentions
                            toward Chile. In the political sense, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> is in effect challenging President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>’s declaration that we are
                            prepared to have the kind of relations with Chile that it is prepared to
                            have with us.</p>
                        <p>A negative decision on the requested Eximbank financing, by adversely
                            affecting the copper negotiations and by persuading Chileans that they
                            have no hope of any <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> financing,
                            would have the effect of showing us in an openly negative posture. This
                            would come at a time when it is important that Chile, and not the U.S.,
                            bear the onus for changes for the worse in Chile and in our
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government since
                            taking power has acknowledged the correctness of our relations with it
                            and publicly reiterated from time to time its own desire to maintain
                            good relations with the United States.</p>

                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is beginning to pursue a deliberately
                            hostile economic policy toward Chile.</p>
                        <p>Specific cases which seem to bother the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> include lack of interest by Chase Manhattan Bank in
                            guaranteeing part of a purchase from Japan of a tanker vessel; negative
                            responses from most of the members of a ten-bank consortium to <gloss

                            guarantees defaulted loans which had been guaranteed by the
                            now-intervened <persName corresp="#p_EEA_1">A. Edwards</persName> Bank
                            in Chile; Eximbank’s unresponsiveness to soundings on new credits for
                            expansion of the Chilean government steel company, for the state
                            railways, and other applications totaling over $16 million; and
                            decreasing availability of Eximbank commercial guarantees and insurance
                            for U.S. exports to Chile.</p>
                        <p>Sensitivity to these strictures is undoubtedly heightened by the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>’s intensifying economic problems, most
                            of which are of its own making and which result from its studied
                            alienation of the entrepreneurial sector, its disincentives to private
                            investment, its discouragement of efficient management, and its resort
                            to inflationary measures to provide immediate, politically advantageous
                            increases in consumption by the working class.</p>
                        <p>We can expect the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> to overlook,
                            consciously or unconsciously, its own culpability for the drying up of
                            foreign capital sources and to use every available means to lever out of
                            the western financial community the capital it needs to help accomplish
                            the transformation of Chile into a socialist society.</p>
                        <p>We can also expect that at least some elements within the government
                            coalition will be prepared to press for a confrontation with us in the
                            belief that they can attribute it to the U.S. and that the benefits they
                            can derive from it would outweigh the gains available from continuing
                            correct relations.</p>
                        <p>An appearance of unrelieved refusal by U.S. sources to consider any
                            further Chilean capital needs would give some encouragement to those who
                            want to convince the world that Chile is a victim of <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> policy. Even those Chileans who have
                            no enthusiasm for a confrontation with the U.S. would probably regard
                            refusal of the Boeing aircraft financing as a significant negative
                            signal from the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. Some could be
                            persuaded that it was a conclusive sign of the unwillingness of the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to respond to <persName

                        <p>In a very real sense, then, we are again faced with the problem of
                            maintaining a public posture which is “correct but cool, to avoid giving

                        <p>Eximbank loans to Kennecott and Anaconda in Chile outstanding as of
                            7-1-70 were $72,205,000 and $57,121,000, respectively.</p>
                        <p>Eximbank in recent weeks has discouraged Boeing from pursuing the
                            aircraft financing project for Chile, in accordance with guidance and
                            with its own banking considerations. Consulted specifically on how it
                            might view the <gloss target="#t_LAN_1">LAN</gloss>-Chile project
                            entirely apart from political considerations, Eximbank took the
                            following position:</p>
                        <p>Provided the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> acknowledged and
                            assumed all debts to Eximbank of U.S. companies expropriated in Chile,
                            Eximbank would be prepared to consider the <gloss target="#t_LAN_1"
                                >LAN</gloss>-Boeing application on economic-banking merits.</p>
                        <p>While Eximbank obviously cannot prejudge the economic-banking merits,
                            there is no conclusive prima facie case against the loan.</p>
                        <p>Eximbank is of course prepared on this basis to cooperate in execution of
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> policy with respect to Chile.
                            It should be remembered that granting of this credit would require
                            Eximbank to consider a number of other important loan projects in
                            Chile.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Other General Considerations.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sale of the aircraft would benefit not only Boeing and the depressed U.S.
                            aerospace industry, but the U.S. balance of payments.</p>
                        <p>In addition, we have learned that McDonnell-Douglas and Boeing are
                            pressing for Eximbank agreement to finance a prospective sale to an
                            internal Peruvian airline operated by the Air Force (SATCO) of either
                            two DC–9’s or two 727’s, worth between $12 and $13 million. Inasmuch as
                            we have followed a restrictive policy on Eximbank lending to the
                            Government of Peru somewhat similar to that with respect to Chile, the
                            decision in the Peru case will obviously have some bearing on the
                            Chilean one in that the Chileans will be alert to any difference in our
                            treatment of the potential Peruvian case.</p>

                        <p>Apart from these general considerations, there are two special aspects to
                            this problem, copper and Cuba, which are discussed below.</p>

                                >Korry</persName> the personal comment that the Boeing matter would
                            have either a very negative or some positive effect on the Big Two.</p>
                        <p>Existing <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> guidance on prospective
                            copper investment expropriation provides that as the situation begins to
                            develop “we would continue to apply present economic restrictions, but
                            would be prepared to relax or intensify them depending on Chilean
                            responses and the outlook for obtaining favorable results.”</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> has led up to the crucial matter
                            of disposing of the major U.S. copper investments in Chile by (a)
                            adopting a harsh constitutional amendment which could easily be
                            interpreted in punitive ways so as to produce little or no compensation
                            to the investors; and (b) negotiating, under the shadow of
                            expropriation, agreements to buy out several other smaller American
                            investors outside the copper mining industry, on terms which have seemed
                            either satisfactory or not excessively unsatisfactory to the owners.
                            These include Bethlehem, Armco, Northern Indiana Brass, Ralston Purina
                            (yet to reach final terms), and <gloss target="#t_RCA_1">RCA</gloss>.

                            amendment mentioned above, it also chose to recognize that the Cerro
                            case differs from the other two major investors, Kennecott and Anaconda,
                            in that the Cerro investment is a new one, in a property which is only
                            now going into production, and on which Cerro has thus far received
                            virtually no return. On May 19 representatives of the <gloss

                        <p>We could seek to use Eximbank consideration of the loan as leverage on

                            <gloss target="#t_LAN_1">LAN</gloss>-Chile is committed to include
                            Havana in its commercial air service to and from Europe. The Chilean
                            Embassy has informed us officially in writing that <gloss

                            thing publicly. (A recent TDCS quoted the new Chilean Ambassador to Cuba
                            as saying, “Boeing... has refused to sell unless it receives a guarantee
                            that the planes will not be used on the Cuban run... (and) most likely

                            to Cuba comes close, in our judgment, to saying that the basic decision
                            on this is not negotiable, the above-cited intelligence report
                            notwithstanding. Subordinate points with respect to service to Havana

                        <p>The Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 bars credits in connection with the

                            thereof, or principally for use in a Communist country. Chile is not a
                            Communist country as defined under the law, and the Act would appear to
                            post no bar to Eximbank financing of the proposed transaction. Eximbank
                            would, however, require that Chile certify that the aircraft would not

                            means that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> could not obligate
                            funds (e.g., make new project or loan agreements) made available under

                        </p>
                        <p>While as set forth above there is no explicit legal barrier to Eximbank
                            financing of aircraft to Chile even when intended for service to Cuba,
                            there is no question but that such a transaction would be in conflict
                            with our general stance on Cuba. A particularly sensitive problem is the
                            potential use of the <gloss target="#t_LAN_1">LAN</gloss>-Chile service
                            by Latin American revolutionaries traveling into Cuba for training and
                            out of Cuba to practice violent subversion elsewhere in the hemisphere.
                            Significant segments of Congress and the public would find this highly
                            objectionable. On the other hand, segments of Congress and the public
                            which have been quick to attack what they see as evidence of a
                            too-hostile <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> attitude toward Chile
                            would criticize our refusal of the loan on such grounds as basically
                            ill-intentioned toward Chile.</p>
                        <p>There would be a clear anomaly in our financing aircraft which has an
                            intended purpose—i.e. service involving Cuba—at odds with the <pb
                                n="337" facs="0377" xml:id="pg_337"/>U.S.-backed <gloss
                                target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> position on Cuba. This could be dealt
                            with by requiring as a condition of the loan that <gloss
                                target="#t_LAN_1">LAN</gloss>-Chile not use the Boeing aircraft in
                            any kind of service to Cuba. In view of Chile’s unequivocal commitment
                            to the installation of Cuba service with new aircraft, however, as
                            mentioned above we believe the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                            would reject such a condition as discriminatory, arbitrary, politically
                            motivated against Chile and an infringement on its sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>There would also be an obvious incongruity in our financing aircraft
                            which might be put into a kind of service—i.e. the carriage of cargo to
                            or from Cuba—which would legally require us to withhold new aid to the
                            purchasing country. One way of dealing with this would be to make it an
                            absolute condition of the loan, invoking general Cuba policy grounds,
                            that <gloss target="#t_LAN_1">LAN</gloss>-Chile give assurance that it
                            would not carry cargo to or from Cuba. The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> could either accept the condition, or reject it as
                            discriminatory and an infringement on its sovereignty and abandon the
                            loan application. Another way to deal with it would be simply to remind
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> that unless it is prepared to
                            forego additional further aid from the U.S. it could not carry cargo to
                            or from Cuba. In this case it is our judgment that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> would receive this as a positive,
                            forthcoming response, and would either give assurance against carrying
                            cargo (and thereby acquire a certain expectation of further additional
                            aid from the U.S.), or decline to give the assurance, asserting its
                            freedom to carry cargo and its readiness to forego further additional
                            aid from the U.S.</p>

                        <p>The following seven options encompass three gross categories of

                        <p>—conditional responses, related to both Cuba and copper (options B, C and

                        <p>—conditional responses, related to Cuba only (options E, F and G).</p>
                        <p>With respect to making responses conditional on copper, it is understood
                            that, while ideally we would await final copper settlements before
                            agreeing to the aircraft loan, favorable developments in the talks could
                            persuade us to respond with the loan approval at some earlier point,
                            this to be decided by the <gloss target="#t_SRG_1">SRG</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>The three graded conditions on Cuba offered for choice in both sets of

                        <p>—that Chile not fly Eximbank-financed aircraft to Cuba.</p>
                        <p>—that Chile not carry cargo on any flights to or from Cuba.</p>
                        <p>—that Chile accept a ban on further US aid if it carries cargo on any
                            flights to or from Cuba.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that a favorable decision under any of the options would
                            be subject to reversal by a serious adverse development in US-Chilean

                        <p>2868. Subject: Exim–Boeing–<gloss target="#t_LAN_1">LAN</gloss> Chile.
                            Ref: State 093739.</p>
                        <p>1. My recommendation is that the Exim financing of <gloss
                                target="#t_LAN_1">LAN</gloss> Chile be executed promptly and
                            unconditionally.</p>
                        <p>2. Before expanding on rationale for said recommendation, we should
                            eliminate from our thinking any suggestion (para 4 <gloss
                                target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>) that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> would accept a “condition”, informally
                            or formally, not to use the planes for the Cuba–Europe run. There is no
                            chance whatsoever. However, if its equipment and operational needs
                            permitted (which I doubt but Boeing would know), <gloss
                                target="#t_LAN_1">LAN</gloss> might be pragmatically persuaded to
                            switch its older Boeings to the Cuba route while using the new ones for
                            other routes.</p>
                        <pb n="346" facs="0386" xml:id="pg_346"/>
                        <p>3. It is my understanding that <gloss target="#t_LAN_1">LAN</gloss>
                            Chile’s in-hand Boeings (aside from those currently rented at high cost
                            from Lufthansa) were also acquired with Exim financing and without any
                            conditions; therefore, they could theoretically be used for a
                            Santiago–Havana run, pending acquisition of other aircraft.</p>
                        <p>4. The British Ambassador’s regular questioning as to our view of the
                            Exim financing request would appear to be indicative of the UK interest
                            in selling the VC–10.</p>
                        <p>5. There is a reasonable chance we could work out an informal
                            understanding with the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> about cargo
                            to Havana but my assessment is that any specific loan pre-condition
                            would be rejected out of hand as an unwarranted clamp on the country’s
                            sovereignty. Given <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            known feelings on this subject, not to mention the ideological tenets of
                            the <gloss target="#t_PS_1">PS</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_PCCh_1"
                                >PCCh</gloss>, I do not see any possibility of acceptance of
                            “political” conditions.</p>
                        <p>6. The critical questions from which we cannot shrink go beyond the
                            bilateral context and even Cuba. Having refused a “normal” Exim
                            operation, as the media here would present it and as all political
                            parties, opposition as well as governmental, would interpret it, we
                            would then appear to have justified the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss>’s exercise of Chile’s sovereignty in its assessment of
                            “fair” compensation for Anaconda, Kennecott and possibly <gloss
                                target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss>. Failure to provide Exim financing for
                            this comparatively small amount of money would surely tend to push the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> towards harsher treatment of
                            the big two of copper who in any event are being maneuvered by the
                            Marxists into the status of a “special case” per <gloss

                            calls on the US Congress, treasury and taxpayer for the funds, then at
                            the minimum, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> should
                            assume full responsibility for having pulled the gun. He is certain that
                            his presentation of Chile’s case against the big two of copper, when
                            presented to Latin and world opinion in the form of dividends and return
                            on investment in recent years, will generate wide comprehension,
                            sympathy and support, even in the US. If we were to strengthen that
                            presentation and its global resonance by having provided gratuitously a
                            pretext per rejection of Exim financing of Boeings, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> position would be so undermined that
                            even affected stockholders of the American companies concerned might
                            well blame the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>7. Beyond that preoccupation is the question of the role of private
                            investment in our overall foreign policy at a time when aid funds are
                            not easily forthcoming from Congress and when the function of private
                            investment overseas is designed to have multiple effect on the degree of
                            pluralism in any country. Could <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss>
                            survive the congressional grilling that would inevitably be the
                            consequence of a substantial call on public funds to cover insurance
                            claims? Without <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss>, or with a se<pb

                            significance? The issue is further complicated by the congressional
                            interest that has been aroused by the Lockheed and Penn Central cases so
                            that the overall environment at home is not the most propitious for
                            assessment of an issue that does have broad implications for US foreign
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>8. I am not rpt not suggesting that if the <gloss target="#t_LAN_1"
                                >LAN</gloss> Chile financing were forthcoming we could abort the
                            aforementioned gloomy scenario. I would only go so far as to say that
                            Exim financing would improve the climate for negotiation of the specific
                            nationalization cases here and that it would avoid isolating ourselves
                            once again into the immobility that the <persName corresp="#p_HBB_1"
                                >Hickenlooper</persName> and other amendments have forced upon us
                            elsewhere in this hemisphere. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s undoubted appeal in Latin America stems from
                            those three trends about which I first wrote so much upon arriving
                            here—nationalism, populism and statism. A rejection by the Exim and the
                            consequent events here would combine to reinforce these three elements
                            just as <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s election has
                            already done throughout this continent.</p>
                        <p>9. I have another speculative thought in mind which I ventilate here
                            because it has some connection with the matter under consideration. I
                            have been much intrigued by the sequence of events that led that
                            Communist tactical genius, Senator <persName corresp="#p_TV_1"

                                corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName>’s planned visit to Chile
                            was being cancelled. Last week the head of the Socialist Party, Senator

                            preferences for Peking which he also will visit. My own reading of what
                            is happening in Chile and in Cuba suggests to me that the <persName

                            outburst against the US, our President and the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1"
                                >OAS</gloss> was directed more to a growing problem within Cuba and
                            among Marxists in LatAm than to its apparent targets. Just as the
                            Communists here have had their tactical way in every significant
                            political event of importance under the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> regime (for example, <persName

                                >PCCh</gloss>, are stepping up their efforts to bridle <persName

                            exerting greater pressure now to cool his extremist foreign policy and

                            Chile) approach to the problems of production. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName> must now be seen by

                            advisors and perhaps their party in Cuba would probably like a more
                            sophisticated performance from Fidel so that the Cuban-Chilean
                            combination can be more effective in achieving the Kremlin’s two
                            immediate LatAm goals—the elimination of US influence and the

                            seem to me to be even more essential now as China edges into this part

                            political backlash in turn for fortifying a longer-term goal of a stable
                            world order and for the immediate tactical advantages in a bilateral

                            General <persName corresp="#p_RC_1">Ruiz</persName>’s stated position
                            that he would have to go to third sources for assistance if he were

                            to procure the aircraft in the U.S.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy/MILGP was instructed in mid-March to inform General <persName

                        <p>On December 19, 1970, the <gloss target="#t_SRG_1">SRG</gloss> decided to
                            defer action as long as possible, while avoiding a negative reply, on
                            any Chilean request for <gloss target="#t_C130_1">C–130</gloss> or
                                <gloss target="#t_F5_1">F–5</gloss>’s. On February 17, 1971, the

                                >FMS</gloss> credit level for Chile of $5 million. In its

                            possibility of using this credit to finance a Chilean Air Force purchase
                            of <gloss target="#t_C130_1">C–130</gloss> aircraft. The <gloss

                            transport configured for cargo and troop lift. With a payload capacity
                            of 45,000 lbs, the aircraft is highly versatile in mission performance
                            ranging from military airlift to civic action.</p>

                        <p>Through our Embassies in Buenos Aires and Rio we have consulted the
                            Argentine and Brazilian governments on the Chilean request to us. We
                            have also asked Embassies Lima, Caracas and Asunción for their
                            views.</p>
                        <p>The Argentine government said that its military was concerned over
                            possible offensive use of the troop-carrying equipment but understood
                            that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> had many other factors to
                            consider and did not go beyond registering the worry in this regard.
                            (Embassy Buenos Aires recommended against <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss> credit sales to Chile.)</p>
                        <p>The Brazilian government only took note of the matter, asserting
                            insufficient time for internal consultation. Our Embassy thought that we
                            will probably receive informal comments during the next few days, but
                            that it did not have the impression that further formal views were <pb

                            suggested that the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> apparently does
                            not wish to share responsibility for an affirmative decision nor
                            contribute to a negative one.</p>
                        <p>Embassy Lima thought that the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> might
                            consider Chilean acquisition of parachutes and <gloss target="#t_C130_1"
                                >C–130</gloss>’s potentially more menacing than <gloss
                                target="#t_F5_1">F–5</gloss>’s since Peru has Mirages because of
                            their suitability for desert operations near Peru’s southern border. The
                            Embassy emphasized its concern over our treating Chile better than Peru,
                            mentioning the additional factor of legislative restrictions regarding
                            military sales to Peru. Embassy Caracas saw no particular reaction
                            resulting from sale of parachutes and <gloss target="#t_C130_1"
                                >C–130</gloss>’s to Chile. Embassy Asunción forecast highly critical
                            reaction from the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>. Our soundings of
                            our five Embassies brought out the strong common theme that our
                            favorable decision on any important <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>
                            request would require us to move immediately to give significant
                            additional amounts to the respective countries in order to avoid serious
                            effects on our relations. There was agreement among the Embassies that
                            there would be considerable public attention to the transaction with
                            Chile and debate over our motives.</p>
                        <p>Another factor bearing on the total program level concerns the worldwide
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credit program ceiling of $340
                            million imposed by Congress in approving the <gloss target="#t_FY_1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1971 <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> legislation.
                            While the <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> ceiling of $75 million
                            for Latin America established by Congress has been waived by
                            Presidential decision, <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credit
                            programs approved for the region must continue to be accommodated with
                            other regional programs within the $340 million ceiling. Present
                            estimates at this late point in the fiscal year indicated that an <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> program level for Chile exceeding $10
                            million could not be accommodated within this overall ceiling.</p>
                        <p>The Chileans’ new priority list, without the fighter aircraft and with a
                            variety of both Army and Air Force equipment, may reflect to a large
                            extent a desire on their part to test U.S. intentions regarding future
                            military relations by listing only those items which have been made
                            available previously to other Latin American nations. This is
                            particularly true with respect to the <gloss target="#t_C130_1"
                                >C–130</gloss> transport for which the Chileans have expressed a
                            continuing interest over the past several years.</p>
                        <p>Chile’s alternatives to the equipment contained in their priority listing
                            are all available in Europe or the Soviet Union. While the equipment
                            request probably reflects a desire by the Chilean military to preserve
                            its U.S. orientation, a negative response on the part of the U.S. would
                            certainly result in a turn to alternative sources.</p>
                        <p>A direct <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credit of $5 million for
                            Fiscal Year 1971 will obviously not be sufficient to purchase all the
                            equipment requested (approximately $20 million), but if $5 million in
                            funds were used to guarantee private credit, then a total credit of up
                            to $20 million could be <pb n="353" facs="0393" xml:id="pg_353"/>offered
                            if the Chileans were able to obtain a commercial loan, guaranteed by
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>, with acceptable repayment and
                            interest terms (<gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> guarantees require
                            a 25% credit reserve). Such an arrangement would result in Chile having
                            one of the largest credit programs in Latin America.</p>
                        <p>Under present circumstances, however, the maximum feasible <gloss
                                target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1971 <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss> credit program level for Chile is apparently $10
                            million. We would not be able to accommodate in <gloss target="#t_FY_1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1971 the total equipment requirements indicated in the
                            priority listing. Within a $10 million credit guarantee program level,
                            however, all of the items in priority listings one and two—i.e., the
                            paratroop equipment and the two <gloss target="#t_C130_1"
                            >C–130</gloss>’s—could be procured (assuming a <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss>-guaranteed commercial loan could be obtained). Should a
                            $10 million guaranteed commercial loan not be attainable at terms
                            acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and direct <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credit be required, the total credit
                            program value would be limited to the approved credit level of $5
                            million. This would cover all of the items in priority one and one of
                            the two <gloss target="#t_C130_1">C–130</gloss> aircraft in priority
                            two. In the latter case, an offer of credit for the purchase of one

                                >FY</gloss> 1971 would probably require approval in principle for

                            the availability of funds, since a minimum of two aircraft would be
                            required to maintain a meaningful lift capability.</p>

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Export-Import Bank Credits for Boeing Aircraft.</hi>
                            This issue will be referred to the President for decision by June 10.
                            Any principal who may disagree with the President’s decision will retain
                            the option of seeking an appointment to present his views personally to
                            the President.</p>
                        <p>The Senior Review Group agreed that in presenting this issue to the
                            President for decision, the objective should be to establish a general
                            policy on extending credit to the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> regime. This policy should take into account
                            pending expropriation of U.S. firms, the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> Government’s steady progress toward
                            establishment of a Marxist regime, and the impact of U.S. policy on
                            public opinion in the United States and Latin America.</p>

                            restriction of credit to Chile in the event the President decides to
                            approve the Boeing aircraft credits.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Foreign Military Sales (<gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                    >FMS</gloss>)</hi>. This issue will also be referred to the
                            President for decision.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We have two issues
                            concerning Chile to discuss. One is Export-Import Bank financing for the
                            Boeings. The other is the <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> issue.
                            Apparently the Chileans and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName> consider the Boeing matter of great policy
                            significance. It poses two issues: (1) whether we should make an
                            exception to our restrictive credit policy and (2) whether we should
                            make our response conditional on some sort of assurance about using the
                            planes to provide service to Cuba.</p>
                        <p>This time we have seven options. Option 1 is to say no to the Chilean
                            request. Then there are three options which would make credit
                            conditional on developments in the copper negotiations and on how the
                            planes are used in service to Cuba. Finally, there are three options
                            that would make credit conditional only on assurances regarding air
                            service to Cuba. Two of these options don’t ask the Chileans to do
                            anything in regard to the Cuban air service; but we inform them of our
                            legal provisions for aid suspension if they carry cargo to Cuba.</p>
                        <p>Is this a fair statement of the issues?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: That was very well
                            done.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What do you think
                            we should do?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: Our preference is
                            Option G. Under this option, we would provide the credit and make an
                            exposition to the Chilean Government of what they would lose if the
                            planes were used in freight service to Cuba.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have one
                            technical question. If we give the Chileans any of these “maybe”
                            answers, can we string them along [on providing the credit] long enough
                            to know how the copper negotiations come out?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: No. This is partly
                            because of Boeing’s requirements. In order to put the planes in
                            production for delivery by the May 1972 date specified by the Chileans,
                            they have to know what we are going to do by the middle of this month.
                            This is partly tied to <gloss target="#t_LAN_1">LAN</gloss>’s operating
                            problems, as they have to have the 707s available when the lease expires
                            on the 707 they are currently using.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Are the copper
                            negotiations going to take long?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: A go-ahead signal has
                            to be given to Boeing before June 15, or the Boeing/<gloss
                                target="#t_LAN_1">LAN</gloss> deal is not going to work.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: Our presumption is
                            that the results of the copper negotiations will be known this fall. Yet
                            delivery of the planes will not be until March or May of 1973.</p>
                        <pb n="358" facs="0398" xml:id="pg_358"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How would it be
                            possible to stop the planes?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: The difficulty is that
                            if we did stop them, we would be hurting Boeing and the copper
                            companies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: What are the prospects
                            that by fall there will be other expropriation cases under way?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: The Chileans’
                            intentions are to take over all American investments. They have just
                            announced plans to expropriate <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> ’s
                            properties.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: Then we will still
                            have a snootful of problems in the fall.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then the question
                            is whether our decision on credits could enhance the prospects for a
                            satisfactory copper settlement or whether it might provide the Chileans
                            a pretext for doing what they were going to do anyway.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of what we do <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            is moving toward a Marxist/Leninist regime as quickly as his domestic
                            situation permits. We are no appreciable restraint on him. The limiting
                            condition up to now has been the domestic situation in Chile and not
                            anything we have done. Our maintaining a correct posture hasn’t slowed
                            him down.</p>
                        <p>I am asking if this is not the case. I am just being the devil’s
                            advocate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: He is moving as fast
                            as the domestic situation permits; yet, up to this point he is still
                            preoccupied with establishing his international legitimacy.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (to <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAI_1">Selden</persName>) What is your view?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAI_1">Selden</persName>: He is moving just as
                            fast as he can, and faster than I thought he would. If his domestic
                            economic situation gets worse, I look for him to move even faster.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That would be an
                            argument for going ahead with the credit to prevent him from moving so
                            fast.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAI_1">Selden</persName>: I suppose you could
                            say that.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: The issue is going to
                            come to a head before the planes are delivered. The economic outcome is
                            not going to be affected much by these Export-Import Bank credits.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Thus, it amounts
                            to whether we would be better off by not triggering what they are going
                            to do anyway. The question is how to place ourselves in the best
                            tactical position in dealing with this. I don’t think anyone believes
                            there’s a chance <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> will
                            slow down.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: That’s right. Also we
                            should consider what effect these credits will really have on the copper
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: We can’t control the
                            communications media in that country. They can tell what they want to
                            tell when they want to tell it.</p>
                        <pb n="359" facs="0399" xml:id="pg_359"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Nachmanoff</persName>: There are some
                            opposition media. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            doesn’t have that much control.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESD_1">Eaton</persName>: There is some internal
                            pulling and hauling within the Chilean Government on how to proceed.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What is the
                            Defense position?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAI_1">Selden</persName>: We think we should
                            agree to furnish the loan if they promise not to stop in Cuba. Then we
                            should begin processing the loan but defer a final decision until we see
                            how the copper negotiations are going. However, I gather from what
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Charlie Meyer</persName> says that we
                            may have to move faster because of Boeing’s problems.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: I talked to the Boeing
                            people. They say they don’t want to create a political problem, but that
                            they have a cash and a manufacturing problem and that they have to get
                            started by mid-June if they are going to do this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAI_1">Selden</persName>: The Chileans may get
                            us off the hook by not accepting the conditions we stipulate [on service
                            to Cuba].</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: My impression from
                            reading the papers is that they won’t accept either condition and
                            certainly not both. Thus, the practical consequence of what you
                                [<persName corresp="#p_SAI_1">Selden</persName>] are saying is a
                            turndown.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAI_1">Selden</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (to <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>) What do you think?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: We should turn the
                            Chileans down. We should not even offer the credit conditional on no
                            stops in Havana. There is a precedent for the Export-Import Bank to turn
                            down credits because of expropriations by the requesting country. This
                            was done in one case in Algeria. It was a hard-won decision.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Forget about
                            Havana. If we turn them down, it’s better to do it on the expropriation
                            issue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Nachmanoff</persName>: (to <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>) Was this Algerian decision
                            before or after expropriation actually took place?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: The issue is
                            sufficiently clouded. Hell, they already passed the legislation
                            providing for the expropriation. Who are we kidding about this?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Nachmanoff</persName>: But they have
                            negotiated with one company.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESD_1">Eaton</persName>: What we do on the
                            credits is likely to prejudice how the expropriation is resolved.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (to <persName
                                corresp="#p_HR_1">Helms</persName>) What is your view?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR_1">Helms</persName>: What merit does this
                            deal have for Boeing? Are they hungry? Relaxed? What would it mean to
                            the American economy?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: Boeing wants to be
                            rewarded for their <gloss target="#t_SST_1">SST</gloss> statement.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If I mention
                                <gloss target="#t_SST_1">SST</gloss>, I know the President will turn
                            it [the credit] down.</p>
                        <pb n="360" facs="0400" xml:id="pg_360"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR_1">Helms</persName>: As I see it, granting
                            the credits may do some good in the copper negotiations if the Chileans
                            choose. I don’t think they are going to pay any attention if we suggest
                            conditions involving Cuba. If the sale is not going to help the U.S.
                            economy, then it boils down to a question of how much we want to gamble
                            on the copper negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (to <persName
                                corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>) What do you think?</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: They will certainly
                            get aircraft anyway. If we deny them the Boeings, they will get
                            others.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What others?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: VC 10’s from
                            England.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: It appears that we
                            have no leverage when you get right down to it. There is an economic
                            advantage in having Boeing and other American aircraft present in the
                            areas. If there’s no gain for us in denying them the aircraft, we ought
                            to let them have them.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: On that basis, all
                            our restrictions would be useless.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: There are not many
                            products for which we are the unique world supplier.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW_1">Nutter</persName>: This matter can give
                            us some political trouble if the Chileans continue to proceed in the
                            direction they have been going.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAI_1">Selden</persName>: What are the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> restrictions that apply in this
                            case?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: They are phrased in
                            terms of bottoms. However, under our law any country that does not
                            prevent aircraft or ships of its registry from transporting equipment,
                            materials or commodities to or from Cuba so long as Cuba is governed by
                            the <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName> regime
                            sacrifices the opportunity of obtaining further U.S. aid. Thus, our aid
                            restrictions would be equally applicable if the Chileans used British
                            aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAI_1">Selden</persName>: Is Chile aware of
                            these restrictions? It will look funny to be giving the Chileans aid so
                            that they can violate our law.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: Our law [on cutting
                            off bilateral aid to countries whose flag carriers take cargo to Cuba]
                            does not apply to Export-Import Bank credits.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The restrictions
                            simply mean that Chile sacrifices further opportunity for aid if the
                            planes stop in Cuba.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW_1">Nutter</persName>: And this would also
                            be true, wouldn’t it, even if they gave assurances that the planes
                            wouldn’t be used on the Cuban run.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Suppose we give
                            them the Export-Import Bank loan. This will set a precedent. How will it
                            be possible to maintain that this particular loan is okay, but that
                            others would be different?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: The Export-Import Bank
                            has a full in-box of credit applications.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s what I
                            mean. Suppose that we turn this request down and grant others. Could we
                            do that?</p>
                        <pb n="361" facs="0401" xml:id="pg_361"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: I don’t see how we can
                            justify making a distinction between this request and others.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR_1">Helms</persName>: There must be plenty of
                            ways we could justify turning down other Chilean requests if we choose
                            to do so. There is no built-in requirement for consistency in the
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But the Bank may
                            be more consistent than the Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: The Export-Import Bank
                            is subject to pressures from other U.S. manufacturers who will want to
                            sell to Chile. We’d like to get a ruling on this issue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: The Bank has some
                            important legislation pending in Congress right now. They are in a
                            vulnerable position.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We need to make a
                            decision by June 15.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: To take care of
                            Boeing.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That means we have
                            11 days.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Nachmanoff</persName>: Could we clarify
                            just what kind of decision is required? I think we need a preliminary
                            commitment rather than a final decision.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: Any favorable decision
                            carries the implication that we will go through with the credit.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: (to <persName
                                corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>) I thought you said that there
                            was some production line problem for Boeing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Nachmanoff</persName>: Export-Import Bank
                            could back out this fall for banking reasons, if the copper negotiations
                            turn sour. Boeing would then of course have to find other customers for
                            the planes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: The market is not good
                            for those planes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: That’s right. With the
                            development of such planes as the Lockheed 1011, the demand for 707’s
                            has tapered off sharply.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: Boeing’s problem is
                            one factor.</p>
                        <p>The Chileans have indicated they do not intend to talk with a smile to
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> about this [purchase of
                            commercial aircraft]. They might try to purchase VC–10s from the
                            British. But they want Boeings. This will also help strengthen <gloss
                                target="#t_LAN_1">LAN</gloss>-Chile’s commercial ties.</p>
                        <p>I think the Chilean Government has created a fish-or-cut-bait [by
                            requesting credits to purchase Boeings].</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: They are damned
                            smart.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: This would apply
                            on all Export-Import Bank loans.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: Not necessarily.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: I sort of agree with
                            Dick [<persName corresp="#p_HR_1">Helms</persName>]. I don’t see why our
                            decision on this request necessarily determines what we say in response
                            to future requests.</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: On what grounds is
                            the Bank going to turn down other loans?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAI_1">Selden</persName>: What happens if we
                            turn them down on Boeings but go ahead with military sales?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: That might seem
                            inconsistent.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Except that we
                            have a theory that we want to work with the Chilean military as much as
                            we can. We want to be sure that the Chileans don’t get an entering wedge
                            with the Boeings. Can we justify the theory?</p>
                        <p>(to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>) Your proposal is
                            that we grant the loan and call their attention to the consequences for
                            aid under our legislation if the planes are used in the Cuban service.
                            We might stop the loan later if conditions warranted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: That’s right.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAI_1">Selden</persName>) Your recommendation is that we
                            exact a proviso that the planes not make stops in Havana and then hold
                            up processing of the loan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAI_1">Selden</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That is really an
                            elegant way of turning them down.</p>
                        <p>(to Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>) Tom, you would
                            just as soon go ahead with the loan.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: It would help if we
                            could somehow depoliticize these credit decisions.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What you mean is
                            that they should be made on strictly commercial grounds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: There are lots of loan
                            requests at the Inter American Bank. If we go ahead with this request,
                            we would in effect be saying “open sesame.”</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In effect that
                            would undo the Presidential order on restricting loans to Chile.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: Every decision we have
                            to make will be something that the Chileans bring up on an ad hoc basis.
                            These decisions are going to get more and more difficult. Whatever we do
                            is not going to affect the situation much.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What incentive do
                            we have to help <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>? Suppose
                            he turns out to be a very strong Marxist? What would we say?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: We would say that he
                            did it by himself. At least that’s what was agreed to at our meetings
                            last year.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We said last fall
                            that he would be in a mess by October and that the best way to weaken
                            him was to pursue a course of cutting off international credit.</p>
                        <pb n="363" facs="0403" xml:id="pg_363"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: I would be interested
                            to hear from others what effect they think these credits may have on the
                            copper negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW_1">Nutter</persName>: I don’t see any end
                            to that sort of approach. They will just keep on saying: “Make this
                            loan, and things will go better.”</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What is involved
                            is whether the President will give up his policy on credit to Chile. We
                            can’t have a meeting of this group to decide on every God-damned loan
                            the Chileans decide to request. We don’t really care about three
                            Boeings, and the Cuban problem is subsidiary. The basic thing is that
                            with these expropriations coming up and the Chilean Government going to
                            a rather strict form of Marxism, we need to decide whether it is in our
                            interest to maintain normal credit policies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: There is a political
                            issue. In the press and nationally, people feel we have followed a
                            correct policy toward Chile. A turndown would be seen as a shift and
                            might diminish the public acceptance of our policy.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Our policy may
                            have the acceptance of the <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi> and
                            the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, but most people in this
                            country don’t even know where Chile is located.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: There are some
                            financial and economic arguments that one could make to justify turning
                            down the credit.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: They would not be
                            convincing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: The Cuban issue is
                            confused by the fact that the Export-Import Bank did provide financing
                            for DC–8s that Iberia is using on the Cuba run.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESD_1">Eaton</persName>: If the Export-Import
                            Bank didn’t want to make any more loans after this one, it could use the
                            argument that its exposure in Chile is too high.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: That is a difficult
                            argument to use. It might mean closing the door on [a possible future
                            sale] by Douglas or by some other American manufacturer. We will be
                            asked why we should favor Boeing over, say, Westinghouse. The answer, I
                            suppose, would be that the priority was decided by the country itself
                            [Chile].</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW_1">Nutter</persName>: The political
                            argument [against granting the credit] has economic implications. Chile
                            is not a very good credit risk. With these expropriations and the fact
                            that they are turning Marxist, there is a question when the
                            Export-Import Bank would get the money back.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: In the copper
                            negotiations, Kennecott got a sweet settlement. If Cerro and Anaconda
                            are looking for the same thing, it will be too expensive for Chile.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, I think there was some intelligence item about the
                            Chileans’ shifting their liquid assets from the United States to
                            Belgium. Is there anything to that?</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR_1">Helms</persName>: I am not familiar with
                            such a report.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What will the
                            Chileans do if we turn them down?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: They said they would
                            look to England. However, they attach great [political] significance to
                            our decision.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think we have
                            exhausted this subject. We will have to get a decision from the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: (to Dr. <persName

                            have been generally favorable to our Chilean policy. Throughout the
                            country there hasn’t been any criticism.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s only
                            because its not yet dawned on people what’s going on.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW_1">Nutter</persName>: There may be some
                            later.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: There will be
                            criticism in Latin America.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What will be the
                            reaction?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: They will ask: “What
                            are you going to do for us?”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: There will be more
                            criticism if we don’t provide the credit. There will also be more
                            support for the Chilean expropriations.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The big decision
                            the President has to make is about our general attitude toward providing
                            credit to Chile and how we position ourselves with relation to public
                            opinion vis à vis Chile. The question is whether we should draw the line
                            now or later. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is trying
                            to propose this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: If this is going to
                            the President for decision, you have to point out to him that an
                            affirmative decision means changing the Export-Import Bank’s policy on
                            expropriation.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But Chile hasn’t
                            expropriated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: That’s just a
                            technical point. Their intentions are clear.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: They are certainly
                            going to expropriate, but we have no evidence that they are not going to
                            provide compensation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: [If we grant this
                            credit], we will be getting far ahead of what Export-Import Bank has
                            done.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Can you make the
                            reverse argument, that is, that if they provide adequate compensation,
                            we will give them credit?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: That would follow.
                            That’s why I made the point earlier that there will be other
                            expropriation cases besides copper coming up.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand the
                            issue. We have to get a Presidential decision. There is both domestic
                            and Latin American public opinion to consider. (to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>) Your position is that it would
                            be best for us not to be in the position of having forced the issue with
                            Chile.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: Yes. There will be a
                            lot of criticism in the country if we turn them down on this issue.</p>
                        <pb n="365" facs="0405" xml:id="pg_365"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW_1">Nutter</persName>: Why on this issue
                            rather than on others?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: Because Chile has not
                            proceeded other expropriations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: They’re inevitable,
                            though.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I will try to get
                            a Presidential decision by the middle of next week. If he makes a
                            positive decision and anyone wants to appeal or if he makes a negative
                            position and anyone wants to appeal, I will try to arrange an
                            appointment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: The main thing is to
                            present all the issues to him.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I will do my
                            best.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: Like Dick [<persName
                                corresp="#p_HR_1">Helms</persName>], I still feel that what we do in
                            this case would not be a precedent for future credit requests.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Do you mind if we
                            explore the question of setting a precedent with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KH_1">Henry Kearns</persName>? We would find out what
                            other stopping points there might be further down the road. Or you can
                            do it if you prefer.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: Why don’t you do
                            it?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA_1">Nachmanoff</persName>) Will you request this
                            information from <persName corresp="#p_KH_1">Henry Kearns</persName>
                            this afternoon and also circulate the paper?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: There is a provision
                            [which says that when an extraordinary situation exists, the
                            Export-Import Bank can cancel the undisbursed amounts of authorized
                            loans]. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName> read the text
                            of the provision.) Thus, if there were expropriation without adequate
                            compensation, we could legally act on the grounds that an extraordinary
                            situation exists. This, of course, brings in <persName
                                corresp="#p_MCA_1">Charlie Meyer</persName>’s point about Boeing’s
                            being stuck with the planes.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If we approved the
                            loan now and then cancelled it in the fall, the political price we would
                            have to pay then would be more than it is now.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: That is true, except
                            that later we might have a clearcut case of expropriation without
                            compensation.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We have to get a
                            policy decision. We can’t waste the time of this group with every bloody
                            Chilean loan. Then once we have a policy decision, we can worry about
                            whether we have the option of retightening our credit restrictions.</p>
                        <p>Now let’s turn to military sales. It seems that if a country has a
                            communist government and a non-communist army, we end up slobbering all
                            over them. Have any generals or admirals been to Chile in the last two
                            weeks? If not, you’re neglecting them. I’m not sure we aren’t giving
                            these guys [the Chilean military] an incentive to support the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> Government. Are they as well
                            off as they were under the previous government? Our theory has been that
                            we continue to provide military aid in order to keep in touch with the
                            Chilean military, but <pb n="366" facs="0406" xml:id="pg_366"/>they show
                            no sign of opposing <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, who
                            gives them no reason for opposing him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAI_1">Selden</persName>: Our only hope is the
                            military. We must remain in touch with them until we know that all
                            possibility that they might oppose <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> is gone.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: It all depends on
                            whether you are looking at the Chilean situation over the short or long
                            range.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What is happening
                            there reminds me of the German military under Hitler in 1933–35.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> gives them a few
                            things here and there, treats them nicely, and just keeps suckering them
                            along.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR_1">Helms</persName>: The situation is very
                            parallel.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He flatters them
                            and gives them what they want; but he will hit them when he is firmly
                            established.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAI_1">Selden</persName>: This is just
                            something we have to gamble on.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: As I understand
                            it, the $5 million in <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> that has been
                            approved can be used to generate $10–20 million in credit. What in hell
                            do the Chileans want with paratroops?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: They give the
                            Argentines heartburn.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What have we done
                            for other Latin American countries that is comparable to this?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAI_1">Selden</persName>: (to Col. Smith) You
                            can tell us what we are doing in Brazil.</p>
                        <p>Col. Smith: In Brazil we are providing $50 million. It is not all credit.
                            Most of it is cash.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How much <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> is Brazil getting this year?</p>
                        <p>Col. Smith: $15 million this year.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And Chile is
                            getting $10 million?</p>
                        <p>Col. Smith: You have to distinguish between the program level and the
                            amount of credit furnished.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Just give us
                            comparable figures.</p>
                        <p>Col. Smith: The program level in Brazil is $15 million. But it could be
                            expanded up to $60 million of credit.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What about
                            Argentina?</p>
                        <p>Col. Smith: $13 million.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You mean program
                            level, don’t you?</p>
                        <p>Col. Smith: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: That means it could go
                            up to $52 million.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Does any Latin
                            American country that is friendlier to us than Chile claim to be
                            suffering?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW_1">Nutter</persName>: In Brazil we might
                            offer up to $72 million.</p>
                        <pb n="367" facs="0407" xml:id="pg_367"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: Do you include Peru as
                            a friendly country? They’re getting practically nothing from us.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: As a normal case,
                            Peru would be a friendlier government than Chile. It has a nationalist
                            military government. Except for the one case [<gloss target="#t_IPC_1"
                                >IPC</gloss>], it has no quarrel with us, Peru doesn’t have a
                            doctrinaire government, and it’s not trying to transform society.</p>
                        <p>I have been impressed with <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s performance so far. He has not made a mistake.
                            He will have a one-party state established by mid-term.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW_1">Nutter</persName>: Getting back to
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>, the total program in Latin
                            America this year will be $80–90 million, almost all of it credit.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: For Chile there
                            will be $5 million, or at most $10 million. (to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGW_1">Nutter</persName>) Are you for this?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW_1">Nutter</persName>: We are for a modest
                            program. $10 million is the program ceiling.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (to Mr. <persName

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: We are in favor,
                            although for 1972 we look with some reluctance on the tanks.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW_1">Nutter</persName>: We’re only talking
                            about 2 <gloss target="#t_C130_1">C–130</gloss>s. I suppose we’d be able
                            to draw the curtain somewhat if they promised to help in the copper
                            negotiations and then didn’t do it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: That would be a hard
                            judgment to make.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t see that
                            this question is going to determine the fate of the world. I will
                            formally present it to the President but imagine he will reluctantly
                            decide to go ahead.</p>
                        <p>Do we have to have senior [military] personnel in Chile all the time?
                            When are we sending someone else?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAI_1">Selden</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGW_1">Warren Nutter</persName> and General Chapman are
                            making a trip to some Latin American countries other than Chile.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: If we turned down the
                            military items, it wouldn’t go well with the military. But we wouldn’t
                            be put into the position where we would be blamed to the same degree if
                            we turned down the Boeing deal.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t know the
                            Chilean military. Would they get the point and tell <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>: “You have gone too far.”?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAI_1">Selden</persName>: If they don’t get the
                            equipment from the U.S., they’ll simply go somewhere else.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Is the issue
                            whether they get $5 million or whether we let them establish a larger
                            program?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: Do they know they are
                            getting $5 million?</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: They do not.</p>
                        <pb n="368" facs="0408" xml:id="pg_368"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: What if our program
                            were held to $5 million rather than $10 million?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW_1">Nutter</persName>: We’re willing to go
                            along with that. We could provide the paratroop equipment and one <gloss
                                target="#t_C130_1">C–130</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What would they
                            get with $10 million.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW_1">Nutter</persName>: We could provide the
                            other <gloss target="#t_C130_1">C–130</gloss>. There’s also the question
                            of getting loans and extra credit.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: Do we know whether the
                            commercial banks would supply this extra credit? Most are still having
                            problems with the Banco Edwards. Even though the government guarantees
                            the loan, the financial reward may not be enough. I think they might
                            have a tough time leveraging this.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then we might wind
                            up with $5 million.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>: You may be interested
                            in a May 26 Reuters item. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1"
                                >Meyer</persName> read the item, which quoted a statement by
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to the effect that
                            Latin American states should not use arms to resolve their differences
                            and that an arms race would be a negative and harmful factor in
                            relations among them.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Nachmanoff</persName>: That statement was
                            specially directed against the President’s decision to waive the $75
                            million ceiling on military assistance to Latin America.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: I think there is less
                            problem for us in extending credit for arms than for Boeings.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR_1">Petty</persName>: You could make a case
                            for either.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAI_1">Selden</persName>: (to Adm. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>) Have the Chilean military been
                            extremely friendly?</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: They have always
                            been. The real question is whether or not we are going to support
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And what they
                            would do if we didn’t support them.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: Yes. However, they
                            are going to buy equipment somewhere.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAI_1">Selden</persName>: What they now have is
                            mostly U.S. equipment. I saw the destroyers and cruisers the Chilean
                            Navy has. They are entirely dependent on us for spare parts. Without us
                            they couldn’t get away from the dock. They indicated to me that they
                            didn’t want to sever their ties with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What does it buy
                            us? While <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> establishes a
                            hostile government, the military get funds but never move against him.
                            All we get is psychic satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAI_1">Selden</persName>: If they never move,
                            maybe we were wrong.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Since we have
                            already approved $5 million, there really isn’t much to decide. As a
                            historian I would be amazed if <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>
                            <pb n="369" facs="0409" xml:id="pg_369"/>were not to build a popular
                            base and a police force so that in one year it will be impossible to
                            overthrow him and the military will be totally impotent. Does anyone
                            want to argue against that?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>: I agree. However, I
                            think he will run into economic problems. We should let him do himself
                            in so that we will not have others blaming us for his failures.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Anytime he wants
                            to say we are to blame, he will find a reason for doing so.</p>

                                <p>Summary: This paper outlined the Export–Import Bank’s position on
                                    the Chilean request for a loan to purchase Boeing aircraft.
                                    Discussion focused on the Bank’s position that credit would not
                                    be extended unless the Chilean Government formally agreed to
                                    provide compensation to those U.S. companies affected by the
                                    recent nationalization programs, provided a detailed statement
                                    of where the loan would be applied in the larger Chilean
                                    economy, and offered a more substantive analysis of the overall
                                    status of its economy.</p>

                                target="#t_LAN_1">LAN</gloss>-CHILE</p>
                        <p>Ex-Im Bank on June 4 set forth in writing its position on the loan to
                                <gloss target="#t_LAN_1">LAN</gloss>-Chile as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Ex-Im emphasizes that credit (financial) problems must be dealt with
                            apart from the political considerations involved. The Chileans should be
                            told unequivocally that:</p>
                        <p>I. “Ex-Im Bank will not extend a credit to <gloss target="#t_LAN_1"
                                >LAN</gloss> unless and until the Chilean Government formally
                            acknowledges and assumes payment of all debts owed to Ex-Im Bank by U.S.
                            companies in Chile taken over by the Chilean Government. In so agreeing,
                            the Chilean Government will have to state clearly that it will pay all
                            such debts as well as its own debts to the Bank <hi rend="italic"
                                >according to existing payment schedules (including acceleration
                                provisions)</hi>.</p>
                        <p>II. “Ex-Im Bank needs a clarification from the Government of Chile as to
                            its priorities for credits for various segments of the Chilean economy
                            (aircraft, steel, railroads and miscellaneous imports). The Bank has
                            already been asked for a loan for <gloss target="#t_CAP_1">CAP</gloss>
                            of $100–$150 million and has been told in January by a Senior <gloss
                                target="#t_CAP_1">CAP</gloss> official that our handling of this
                            application will be a test of U.S.–Chile relations. Also, the <pb
                                n="370" facs="0410" xml:id="pg_370"/>amount of requests for exporter
                            guarantees and insurance is very considerable and the Bank cannot make
                            the <gloss target="#t_LAN_1">LAN</gloss> loan and continue to hold up
                            exporter requests pending clarification of the Chilean situation as it
                            is now doing under instructions from the State Department.</p>
                        <p>III. “Ex-Im Bank needs clarification of economic and financial conditions
                            in Chile, including trends in balance of payments, external debt and
                            exchange reserves. Before taking definitive action on the loan, the Bank
                            would like to have a clearer idea of the probable results of the copper
                            negotiations with Kennecott and Anaconda insofar as they affect the
                            economic and financial situation in Chile.</p>
                        <p>“The foregoing approach presupposes that there are no general political
                            objections to the <gloss target="#t_LAN_1">LAN</gloss> transaction and
                            that such specific issues as the Cuban problem can be dealt with
                            satisfactorily.”</p>
                        <p>Discussion of this position with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KH_1"
                                >Kearns</persName> and his senior staff brought out the following
                            points:</p>
                        <p>1. Any or all of the economic considerations mentioned in the above
                            statement of Ex-Im Bank’s position could be put to the Chileans either
                            (a) informally in conversations as conditions precedent to consideration
                            of an application, or (b) formally in writing in a Preliminary
                            Commitment as preconditions to the approval of the loan.</p>
                        <p>2. A Preliminary Commitment, which specifies the conditions on which the
                            Bank will consider the application and the terms which the loan will
                            carry if approved, is not a legal commitment to authorize the loan, but
                            the Bank considers itself morally obligated to approve the loan if the
                            applicant fulfills the conditions specified in the Preliminary
                            Commitment. That is, once the Preliminary Commitment is given, the Bank
                            would not ordinarily be willing to reject the loan on grounds other than
                            non-compliance with conditions specified in the Preliminary Commitment.
                            The standard loan agreement provision entitling the Bank to cancel the
                            loan after the authorization would be employed only in extreme
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>3. The Bank has precedents for imposing each of the conditions alluded to
                            in the discussion of its position (but there is no single case which
                            includes all of them).</p>
                        <p>4. There is no precedent for including as a written pre-condition of a
                            Preliminary Commitment a requirement that the borrowing country make
                            satisfactory settlements with expropriated U.S. investors but a
                            requirement was made informally to Algeria last year that it make
                            settlement with expropriated U.S. companies and no action was taken by
                            the Bank on loans in the petroleum sector which Algeria was seeking
                            until there had been settlement with the companies involved. The third
                            point in the Bank’s position related to Chile, as stated above is not
                            tended to place the Bank in the role of determining whether the copper
                            settlements are satisfactory to the interested parties but to permit the
                            Bank to put the effects of the settlement into its appraisal of economic
                            and financial conditions in Chile. In effect, this would provide a <pb
                                n="371" facs="0411" xml:id="pg_371"/>banking basis for denying final
                            approval of the loan if there were an unacceptable outcome of the copper
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>5. The Bank sees no way to make the <gloss target="#t_LAN_1"
                            >LAN</gloss>-Chile application an isolated special case; it believes
                            that approval of the loan would require relaxation of the current policy
                            restrictions on new credits to Chile (as well as Peru).</p>
                        <p>6. The Bank believes that approval of the aircraft loan would result
                            immediately in bringing pressure from U.S. exporters eager to maintain
                            or recover their position in the Chilean market, which historically has
                            imported a substantial portion of its equipment needs from the U.S.
                            There would also be pressure for borrowing directly by the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> and its industrial and commercial
                            entities. The total of these transactions could eventually amount to
                            something over $200 million, of which about $50 million would be in
                            smaller individual transactions which the Bank would feel obliged to
                            process in the near term.</p>
                        <p>7. With respect to the Bank’s condition Number II, by requiring as a
                            pre-condition to the loan a statement from the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> of its priorities with respect to intended direct
                            borrowings from the Bank and assurance of official reservation of
                            foreign exchange for all such borrowings, the Bank could divert
                            pressures to the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>, although the
                            Chileans probably would infer that the Bank’s facilities would be open
                            for those transactions considered by the Chileans to be of a high
                            priority nature.</p>
                        <p>8. The Bank points out that <gloss target="#t_LAN_1">LAN</gloss>-Chile is
                            a losing proposition and that bankability of the loan would depend
                            exclusively on the guarantee of the Central Government.</p>
                        <p>9. The Bank is unimpressed by Boeing’s assertion of deadlines and states
                            that this is a well-worn sales pressure technique which the Bank
                            encounters and discounts daily.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: What I wanted to talk to
                            you about, John, is to be sure you understand what my attitude is on all
                            the, on the first hand, on these various loans and so forth to places
                            like Chile. Second, my attitude towards the International Monetary Fund.
                            [unclear] they’re coming up to me with this stuff [unclear]—</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>: I’m sure that State
                            will.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: And, I just got Henry in
                            this morning. He was in New York yesterday; that’s why he couldn’t join
                            us last night. But his [unclear]—and I reminded him, I told Henry I need
                            this and that you want to talk to him and wanted to meet and talk to me
                            before that. But in any event, then I said, I wanted to be sure you
                            understood that, when I—on that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>, on that Chilean thing—that I had not yet asked
                            your position. He said Treasury sent a [unclear] to make sure everybody
                            else—we’ve got to string Agnew to get Congress and the rest, and also
                            for a variety of reasons—that they’re in line. In other words—my
                            feelings about it are pretty, are very strong. That, first, I
                            can’t—first, I realize, let’s start with this proposition: that
                            everything we do with the Chilean Government will be watched by other
                            governments and revolutionary groups in Latin America as a signal as to
                            what they can do and get away with. Therefore, I tend to be against
                            doing anything for them. The second thing is that I feel that, as you
                            do, that it’s—the American people will, at the appropriate time, they’ll
                            welcome our taking a goddamn strong position against one of these
                            things. The people, I mean publicly, and, of course, there’s a lot in
                            this for us to do that. They’re calm, and the only thing that confuses
                            them from time to time is always to have this thrown up to us. It’s
                            particularly the argument that is made by the State [Department]
                            people—and it would be convincingly said—that they always make, and that
                            is that, “Well, you’re going to help them more than you hurt them by
                            tearing them down.” The point being that you make martyrs of them, and
                            everybody’s watching us to see whether we’re being fair, and all that
                            sort of thing. I told Henry this morning <pb n="373" facs="0413"
                                xml:id="pg_373"/>that I was a little tired of hearing that argument.
                            Now, let’s leave that one.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is discussion of India and Pakistan.]</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Despite <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, you know, trying to make us
                            the goat of the assassination of the Christian Democratic Secretary of
                            the Interior [Edmundo Pérez Zujovic] down there—first, if we’d attempted
                            it, we’d have done it. If we did anything, if we were participating, we
                            were just doing a goddamn poor job. And I just don’t think we’re—we’re
                            poor at the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, but not that poor.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>: [Laughs]</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: But, nevertheless, coming
                            back to the India–Pakistan thing. You were right, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP_1">Bill [Rogers]</persName> was wrong, on the point
                            about the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, particularly
                            their staffs. Now, I don’t agree with, well, leaving Schweitzer and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRS_1">McNamara</persName> out of it, because
                            they have, I must say, they’ve gone along with their staffs. But they
                            are playing the role of God in judging not just the economic viability
                            of loans, but whether or not loans should be made to nations that,
                            frankly, live up to the moral criteria that we think governments should
                            live up to. I don’t think that has anything to do with a loan. The State
                            [Department] argument there is that it does, you know, count and that
                            affects stability and so forth. You show me—on the other hand, in my
                            view, if a loan is to be made, maybe a dictatorship is the most stable
                            damn country to make it to. And if it is, make it to a dictatorship. If,
                            on the other hand, you show me some cesspool like, well, like some of
                            these Latin American countries like Colombia, and the rest, that are
                            trying to make it the other way, they can be very bad risks. The very
                            fact that they are supposed to be [unclear]. I, frankly, feel that on
                            this loan business that it’s extremely important—extremely important—for
                            us to stay out of it, other than [unclear]. Look, when I say “us,” for
                            the international lending agencies to get into this whole business of
                            political [unclear]. And now, I said some of these things last night,
                            and I want you to know that that’s the feeling. I want Henry to say a
                            word about the Chilean thing, and where it stands, and Bolivia, and
                            where we go from here. It is very important that you, in other words,
                            that you keep in—and I haven’t brought <persName corresp="#p_PPG_1">Pete
                                Peterson</persName> in because he isn’t yet sophisticated enough in
                            this field, but I want to talk to him, quite candidly as this—but it’s
                            very important that you know that what you’ve got in mind—this is
                            general gut reaction now—I want you to know that you’re riding high.
                            What—the way it comes to me is, you see, I’ve got a whole stack of
                            papers in here—</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>: Hm-hmm.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: —and the rest, and I say,
                            well, [et cetera]. And my views are strong, strongly in this direction.
                            Henry supports that position and—I mean not that he’d allow his views; I
                            mean, he naturally supports my <pb n="374" facs="0414" xml:id="pg_374"
                            />views—but even as a matter of conviction. But I’d like for you [to
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>] to just tell me
                            how John’s input did get in, that we did take it into account, and what
                            we finally did.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, first—</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Let’s talk about

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, the problem
                            with the 707s is that we can write credit restrictions into it that
                            would give us a hand, but it would then open the door for every other
                            credit application. Don’t you think?</p>

                            I’m concerned on the 707s are—they’re really immaterial. And if there’s

                            other purpose with these airplanes, I have no argument. Now, to the
                            extent that, in any case, we’re going to continue to give them credit,
                            that’s where I do have some objections.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, on that, that’s
                            the heart of your argument: that one can view it as not just speaking
                            about the restrictions on that particular loan. All the loan planes
                            would almost certainly be used on the round trip stops to Cuba.</p>

                            argument that was made was that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> had insisted that we were refusing these loans

                            and ask Henry. And, Henry, I want you, in your turn, to ask him. You

                            <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>: Well, you see where
                            this gets to be a—where this gets to be a real problem for us. We have
                            two general propositions: One, we have our bilateral aid and what we do.
                            Then we have, secondly, what we do in the multilateral field. Well, now,
                            in Bolivia, specifically on that <pb n="378" facs="0418" xml:id="pg_378"
                            />subject, before the Inter-American Bank is going to come the
                            proposition: Do we approve a $19 million loan to Bolivia that will have
                            to be followed by approximately a $24 million loan from the World Bank,
                            for a total of $43 million, to build a pipeline from this oilfield that
                            they had expropriated from Gulf to run into Argentina. They proposed to
                            pay us $78 million for this expropriated oil and gas property over a
                            20-year period, at no interest, out of 25 percent of the oil and 33⅓
                            percent of the gas that they develop and sell from Gulf’s oilfield to
                            Argentina, after we put up the money to build the line. Now, that’s
                            their proposition to Gulf, which Gulf wants because they say, “Well, you
                            know, this is our only hope. If we don’t get this, we get nothing.”
                            Well, then we—then we give them a <gloss target="#t_PL480_1"
                                >PL–480</gloss> loan. We negotiated an agreement with them on April
                            30th and 31st, and the very next day, they expropriate [Mina] Mathilde
                            [Corporation], which is a company of Engelhard Minerals and United
                            States Steel, during that day, May the 1st, to celebrate May Day. In
                            January, they expropriated the International Metals [Processing]
                            Company. The <gloss target="#t_IMPC_1">IMPC</gloss> is a little old
                            company that was formed for the purpose of taking [unclear] cans out of
                            one of the old Patino mines, which is waste material. They developed a
                            little process, that they figure they can take the waste [unclear] from
                            this mine and get enough tin out of it to be economically feasible. It’s
                            not a lot of money in it, but perhaps $3 million. We’ve got a $1 million
                            guaranteed. Then we come to Guyana, and these are all pyramiding, as you
                            well know. Guyana passed a legislative act through their legislature, in
                            effect, expropriating all bauxite in the country. Okay, this first
                            applies to Alcan. Now, they say, “Oh, well, we’re not going to touch
                            Reynolds.” There are two companies: Alcan and Reynolds. And they’re
                            saying to our people, to United States people, “Well, we will be done.
                            Don’t worry. We’re just talking about Alcan. Reynolds is going to be all
                            right.” Well, as soon as they get Alcan chewed up, well then, they’ll
                            take Reynolds, of course. [Unclear] Now, the Jamaicans, on the other
                            hand, have—are saying to us directly that, “If Guyana gets away with it,
                            we’re going to be under great pressure from the left to expropriate all
                            the bauxite holdings of American companies in Jamaica.” Look, between
                            Suriname, Jamaica, and Guyana, that’s 80 percent of the bauxite produced
                            in the world. And in Jamaica, alone, you’ve got the Aluminum Company of
                            America, you’ve got Reynolds, you’ve got Kennecott Copper, you’ve got
                            Kaiser, you’ve got all the major aluminum companies. And we’ve got
                            exposure. We’ve got an investment of seven-hundred and roughly fifty
                            million dollars in Jamaica. We’ve got insurance of $465 million against
                            it. We’ve got a billion and half dollars insurance in Latin America
                            alone, and we’re already looking at paying out somewhere between $500
                            million and $700 million, just to get things started.</p>

                            one the other day. It was a big one. It was $8.6 million for Bolivia. It
                            was a cattle deal; they’re going to buy some New Zealand cattle for
                            eight million bucks.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>: And it helps them to
                            that extent. And the only thing, the only pry we have on them, the only
                            lever we have on them, it seems to me, is at least if we could shut off
                            their credit, or shut off the markets for the commodities they produce,
                            or something. But we have to be in a position to impose some economic
                            sanctions on them. Now, you can’t impose military sanctions, but we can

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It could be very

                            <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>: As soon, once you get
                            this studied, let me suggest to you that you get us involved, to the
                            President, of making a statement, issuing a statement, a statement of
                            policy—a White Paper, so to speak—in which he instructs all the
                            government that as a matter of policy, this government will not vote
                            for, nor favor, any loan to any country that has expropriated American
                            interests, unless and until that country is furnishing good and
                            sufficient evidence that satisfactory payment has been made. And now,
                            that’s basically the policy of the World Bank, now; it is not the policy
                            of the Inter-American Development Bank. It’s a loose thing, and we
                            operate one multi-national bank one way, one S.O. [statement of] policy,
                            and our bilateral aid is operated on still another policy. And this has
                            the effect, it seems to me, if this—and, you see, to me, this does two
                            things: Number one, it serves what [unclear]. And secondly—and it’s a
                            uniform policy. Secondly, it says to all these nations, “You can’t
                            expropriate our people and continue to get financial help from us until
                            you decide how you’re going to pay them.” And third, it says something
                            to the American businessman that I think is extremely important and
                            extremely powerful.</p>

                            now, Henry, to reevaluate the keeping our relations with the military in
                            Chile. I personally think the chance of a coup there is zilch. I also
                            think that the military is, as you pointed out, has been isolated. I
                            think all we’re going to do is just pour money into them. Goddamnit, let
                            the Russians put up the money for it. Let it be a drain on the Russians.
                            I just have a feeling here that—I think we ought to treat Chile—begin
                            treating them, and as we get along, and don’t worry too much about
                            it—like we treat this damn <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel

                            There can’t be any change on that. We’re doing the right thing about

                            Assistant Secretary of Treasury informing them of the President’s
                            decision to (1) approve the $5 million <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss> ceiling for Chile, and (2) defer a decision on the

                            defer the Boeing decision.</p>
                        <p>I just want to be sure that it is clearly understood that a deferral of
                            the Boeing decision for more than a few more days probably will be
                            viewed as a negative decision by the Chileans and will have all the
                            adverse consequences cited in the <gloss target="#t_SRG_1">SRG</gloss>
                            papers—i.e., damage the prospects for fair compensation for the copper
                            companies and other U.S. investors, and increase the risk that <gloss
                                target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss> will have to pay off $400 million in

                                >Allende</persName> an issue with which to challenge the credibility
                            of the President’s public posture toward Chile; and gain support and
                            sympathy in Chile and in the U.S. I think we can assume that the press
                            will play this up as a political decision inconsistent with the more
                            liberal trade policies we are now pursuing vis-à-vis China and the
                            Soviet bloc.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, I seriously doubt that the copper companies would agree
                            with <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>’s thesis that a
                            tough line on the Boeing loan might improve their chances of getting
                            compensation. It should also be noted that there are no clear cases of
                            expropriation without compensation in Chile at this time; the <gloss

                            settlements with U.S. companies that have been nationalized or is in the

                        <p rend="center">Introduction</p>
                        <p>1. During <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s first eight
                            months as President, Chilean economic policy has concentrated on the
                            immediate objective of building political support. Various steps have
                            been taken to this end, notwithstanding their eventual economic
                            consequences. Chile is beginning, for example, to encounter
                            balance-of-payments problems because of sharply increased consumer
                            demand, disruptions of output resulting from nationalization, and the
                            negative reaction of Chile’s traditional creditors. The nation had a
                            large cushion of foreign reserves when <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> took office, but they are being depleted
                            rapidly. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> eventually will
                            be forced to take politically unpopular actions to restrict consumer
                            demand, which could have serious political implications—particularly if
                            he has failed to consolidate his position. This memorandum discusses the
                            economy’s developing problems and short-term prospects and assesses the
                            implications for <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            future.</p>

                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s policies have
                            largely succeeded in achieving their immediate objectives of
                            reactivating the economy and massively redistributing income, thereby
                            boosting the administration’s popular support. <pb n="387" facs="0427"

                            </figure> A strict price freeze and wage increases ranging from 35% to
                            45% for most employees have sharply increased consumer demand from its
                            initial post-election slump. Although inflationary pressures are
                            mounting, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> thus far has
                            held the increase in consumer prices to less than half the rate of
                            recent years (see Figure 1). Because factory owners were reluctant to
                            hire workers that they might not be able to discharge later,
                            unemployment remained fairly high during <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s first months in office. But the consumer boom
                            and large public spending program recently have sharply reduced the
                            ranks of the unemployed.</p>
                        <p>3. Fiscal policy has played a large part in stimulating production and
                            furthering income redistribution. The 1971 budget projects a 60%
                            increase in expenditures in nominal terms. Government revenues, however,
                            are expected to stagnate because of production problems, lower prices,
                            and rising costs in the copper industry and severely depressed profit
                            margins in other industries. As a result, the 1971 deficit probably will
                            equal 25%–30% of expenditures, or 7%–8% of gross national product. Thus
                            far, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s budget deficit
                            has been financed almost entirely by Central Bank loans to the public
                            sector—that is, by printing money. The cumulative amount of these loans
                            has increased about tenfold since <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> was elected, and the money supply has jumped by
                            about 70% (see Figure 2).</p>

                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has emphasized rapid
                            expropriation of the remaining large farms and, until recently, even
                            tacitly encouraged peasant takeovers of large and medium-sized holdings.
                            The administration announced that it reached its goal of expropriating
                            1,000 farms several weeks before the scheduled date of 30 June 1971,
                            when a new agricultural year began. Plantings of winter wheat reportedly
                            are down sharply this year, and the regime has begun to express concern
                            privately about the effect of land seizures and expropriations on
                            agricultural output. Since the seizures also have had an unfavorable
                            political impact, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> now
                            publicly opposes them. While expropriation has been depressing marketed
                            farm output, rising incomes—especially for lower income groups—have
                            boosted food demand by at least 10%–15%.</p>

                        <p>5. Nationalization of industrial and commercial firms is destroying
                            investment incentives and disrupting production in many firms, partly by
                            contributing to poor worker discipline. The effects are most pronounced
                            in the copper industry, but other sectors are also being affected. A
                            major stratagem in <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            takeover of manufacturing firms has been to use labor disputes as a
                            pretext for appointing government managers, under a 1945 statute that
                            prohibits discharging workers. This policy has led to widespread
                            absenteeism, with up to half of the workers reportedly failing to appear
                            in some plants on either Mondays or Tuesdays. In an attempt to control
                            these problems, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            Popular Unity coalition has established workers’ “vigilance” committees
                            in most factories to report on and intimidate those responsible for
                            production losses.</p>
                        <p>6. Socialization of the economy—already characterized by extensive state
                            control—has progressed notably under <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>. The final step in fully nationalizing the large
                            US-owned copper mines is now completed, although compensation remains to
                            be determined. The state has bought control of most private banks and
                            taken over almost all the large textile firms and several steel
                            fabricators and gas distributors. In addition, it has nationalized
                            Bethlehem Steel Company’s iron ore properties and the nitrate mines
                            owned by Anglo-Lantaro. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            has used various techniques in the takeovers, including the securing of
                            a constitutional amendment to facilitate copper nationalization, direct
                            negotiations in the case of the iron and nitrate mines, purchases of
                            bank shares (after making continued operations unprofitable for the
                            owners), and appointment of government managers for firms in such
                            industries as textiles and cement. Chile has taken control of something
                            like one-third of the private industry remaining in 1970.</p>

                            being reflected in increased imports, since considerable stocks of
                            finished goods, components, and raw materials were accumulated during
                            the post-election slump in sales. Although imports of such goods have
                            not yet increased appreciably, higher real incomes already have been
                            translated into larger foodstuff imports. During January–April 1971,
                            imports of industrial raw materials and fuel were only about 8% higher
                            than in the corresponding 1970 period, but foodstuff imports more than
                            doubled. Because capital goods imports fell, total imports were only 10%
                            higher than a year earlier.</p>
                        <p>8. Export earnings are down considerably from 1970, reflecting both lower
                            copper prices and production problems in the large copper mines. The
                            near-completion of copper expansion programs last year was expected at

                            mines. Contrary to Chile’s expectations, increased export volume has not
                            offset the decline in copper prices.</p>
                        <p>9. At the same time, traditional sources of foreign credit and investment
                            are rapidly drying up. Short-term and medium-term credit outstanding
                            from US commercial banks has fallen from $225 million to less than $165
                            million since the Presidential election last September, and US companies
                            not yet affected by nationalization are repatriating funds as rapidly as
                            possible. Chile is finding it very difficult to replace US investment
                            and credit with funds from other Western countries, partly because heavy
                            borrowing by past administrations has given it one of Latin America’s
                            largest long-term foreign debts. The total outstanding now approximates
                            $2.4 billion, and debt service obligations (principal and interest)
                            amount to about $300 million this year. Since a sizable portion of this
                            debt is held by West European interests, they may be hesitant to
                            increase the amount at risk. The net result of heavy debt service
                            payments, lower exports, higher imports, and the drying up of foreign
                            bank credit has been a drop in Chile’s net international reserves from
                            $345 million to some $200–$225 million during the first six months of
                            1971, despite receipt of $17 million in special drawing rights from the
                            International Monetary Fund.</p>

                        <p>10. Although problems are looming, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> and his extreme leftist coalition probably will
                            be able to continue their politically expedient economic policies during
                            the next few months. In several respects, the regime may well be able to
                            point to a favorable record of accomplishment for the year. The adverse
                            effect of agrarian reform on farm output will not be fully apparent
                            until the harvest begins in early 1972, and there will be gains in
                            mining and manufacturing output because of recent additions to copper
                            production capacity and the strong demand for consumer goods. Chances
                            thus seem good that the real economic growth rate in 1971 will exceed
                            the 4% average of the past four years. Successful use of price controls
                            and expanded imports to curb inflation so far this year suggests that
                            the cost-of-living will rise less than in recent years, despite the
                            large wage increases and massive increase in the money supply.</p>
                        <pb n="391" facs="0431" xml:id="pg_391"/>
                        <p>11. The main cost of continuing present economic policies for several
                            more months will be a further marked drop in foreign reserves—if copper
                            production remains well below capacity and there is no sustained rise in
                            prices as a result of an extended strike in the US industry. Imports are
                            likely to rise by 15%–20% this year because of expanded food purchases,
                            and export earnings so far are down because copper prices have averaged
                            less than 50 cents a pound, compared with 64 cents in 1970. Under these
                            circumstances, the trade deficit seems likely to reach $100–$200
                            million. Even if remittances by the copper companies (including
                            compensation for final nationalization) are very small, as seems likely,
                            service transactions stand to add another $100 million or so to the
                            deficit. A substantial loss of reserves thus is in prospect unless the
                            capital account balance is favorable.</p>
                        <p>12. Everything considered, however, Chile probably will have a net
                            capital outflow of some $50–$100 million in 1971. The backlog of about
                            $400 million in development credits from Free World nations and
                            international agencies is an element of strength and might permit
                            drawings of as much as $200 million this year. But such receipts would
                            merely balance the scheduled debt amortization payments, which Chile is
                            likely to meet during at least most of 1971—although rescheduling may be
                            sought after reserves deteriorate further. In the case of short-term
                            capital, a sizable net outflow seems likely, since US commercial banks
                            anticipate further cutbacks in credit lines to Chile. It is doubtful
                            that these losses can be fully offset by drawings on credits from
                            Communist countries or by West European and Japanese loans and
                            investments. With a 1971 balance-of-payments deficit of some $250
                            million—the smallest amount that can reasonably be expected barring
                            policy changes or strengthening copper prices—net foreign reserves would
                            drop to roughly $100 million. Such reserves (which would equal only one
                            month’s purchases of goods and services) probably are close to the
                            minimum needed to conduct normal commercial relations.</p>

                        <p>13. Sometime toward the end of 1971 or early in 1972, Chile probably will
                            have to start living more in accordance with its means. If accelerating
                            inflation, black markets, and some form of rationing are to be avoided
                            next year, the government will need to take strong actions such as
                            severely restricting wage increases, raising taxes, and curbing credit
                            expansion. Next year could also see the beginning of a major
                            reallocation of resources from private consumption to investment if
                            balance-of-payments constraints and bottlenecks in production capacity
                            are sufficiently severe and if the regime subscribes to the usual
                            Communist formula for economic development. Corrective measures will be
                            difficult to carry out, however, and will be politically unpopular. The
                            existing dissension among the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"

                            Chile’s economic elite gives way to formulating long-term programs for
                            the new “socialist” Chile. Even if economic policy fails to reach such a
                            stage but consists largely of reacting to economic strains, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> may have trouble building a
                            consensus for action.</p>
                        <p>14. Unless copper prices rise dramatically or copper production problems
                            are solved rapidly, Chile probably will be forced to curtail imports
                            sometime during the next several months—either through direct controls
                            or substantial devaluation of the escudo, which is now grossly
                            overvalued. Demand for imported raw materials and manufactured goods
                            will soon rise markedly because the stocks accumulated during late 1970
                            are now largely exhausted. At the same time, Chile probably will need a
                            further large increase in food imports because agrarian reform and
                            peasant takeovers probably will cause a poor 1972 harvest.</p>
                        <p>15. The Minister of Economics has stated that following the present
                            period of “reactivation,” Chile will enter a period of
                            “accumulation”—that is, heavy expenditures for investment such as are
                            found in other Communist countries. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s original timetable called for the reactivation
                            period to last until the “Revolution became irreversible,” which means
                            until effective political opposition had been eliminated. The
                            reactivation phase is supposed to end in about April 1972, but the rapid
                            depletion of foreign reserves may force earlier action despite the
                            political risks involved.</p>
                        <p>16. If the economic situation deteriorates seriously, the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime probably will turn to
                            Communist countries for aid to ease problems and minimize the political
                            backlash that basic corrective measures would provoke. We believe, as
                            Chilean Communists reportedly have asserted on several occasions, that
                            some assistance would be forthcoming from these countries, although it
                            is doubtful that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>—Chile’s most
                            likely Communist benefactor—would supply aid to the extent envisioned by
                            the local Communists. Against the backdrop of continuing heavy support
                            for Cuba, Moscow will continue to move carefully in backing the world’s
                            first popularly elected Marxist government and, in fact, has urged
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to proceed
                            cautiously in implementing his reforms. Even if unwilling to provide a
                            large amount of convertible currency, Communist countries could assist
                            Chile by supplying goods normally purchased in Western markets—such as
                            petroleum, iron and steel, and certain foodstuffs—as well as by
                            extending the customary economic development loans. Such assistance,
                            however, probably would help only partly to meet Chile’s pressing need
                            for large amounts of relatively untied capital.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Note</p>
                        <p>In the first nine months of his government of Popular Unity, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Salvador Allende</persName> has moved
                            skillfully and confidently toward his declared goal of building a
                            “revolutionary, nationalistic, and socialist society on Marxist
                            principles.” His problems are mounting; but he is still firmly in
                            control, most of his policies enjoy wide popular support, and his
                            ability to manipulate the levers of power is growing. His strategy and
                            timetable are impossible to predict in detail. The purpose of this
                            estimate is to make a general assessment of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s course and its likely effect on Chile’s
                            internal institutions and external relations over the next few years. In
                            it we examine the strengths and weaknesses of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s governing coalition and the
                            opposition parties, the role of the military, the state of the economy,
                            and the new look in Chile’s foreign relations. In a final section we
                            advance some general propositions about <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s future problems, factors affecting the
                            survival of a competitive, multiparty political system, and the outlook
                            for Chile’s relations with the US and other nations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary and Conclusions</p>
                        <p>A. Since it assumed power last November, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Salvador Allende</persName>’s government has quickened the pace of
                            ex-President Frei’s “revolution in liberty”, and set in motion a major
                            transformation of the Chilean economy and society, posing new challenges
                            to the traditional political order. The ruling Popular Unity (<gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>) coalition is dominated by <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s loosely organized,
                            militantly radical Socialist Party, and the <pb n="394" facs="0434"
                                xml:id="pg_394"/>better disciplined, more cautious, pro-Moscow
                            Communist Party. Despite disagreements over tactics and timing, the
                            Socialists and Communists have worked together for years, and there is
                            little short-term prospect of a split serious enough to drive one or the
                            other out of the coalition.</p>
                        <p>B. The most important opposition party is the Christian Democrats (<gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>). It is still the largest single
                            party, with a strong position in Congress, but is factionalized and in
                            financial trouble. Its relations with the other significant opposition
                            party, the conservative National Party, normally are bad. Their recent
                            joint efforts in a congressional by-election produced a victory, and
                            further <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> collaboration is likely, but
                            mutual hostility is so great that sustained collaboration against the
                                <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> is unlikely.</p>
                        <p>C. Thus far the regime has directed its economic policies toward popular
                            political ends, concentrating on the takeover of major industries and
                            private banks, acceleration of agrarian reform, and the redistribution
                            of income in favor of the underprivileged. Now inflationary pressures
                            are rising as accumulated stocks are exhausted and production has not
                            kept pace with demand. Imports are rising rapidly and Chile’s foreign
                            exchange reserves are dwindling. Potentially, copper export earnings
                            could produce the required foreign exchange, but likely production
                            increases at expected prices would not permit <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to continue to meet increased
                            demands and appetites of the populace. If accelerated inflation, black
                            markets, and serious shortages are to be avoided, by early 1972
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> will have to take
                            some politically unpopular actions and seek more outside aid.</p>
                        <p>D. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s dilemma is that,
                            having done all the easy things, he has still not gained sufficient
                            political strength to carry him surely through the difficult times
                            ahead. His popularity seems almost certain to decline as economic
                            problems set in. Many in the coalition would like to avoid the 1973
                            congressional election, and pave the way to their own extension of
                            power, by holding a plebiscite to replace Congress with a unicameral
                            “People’s Assembly”, which they would expect to control. But we do not
                            think <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> can count on the
                            electorate to approve such a change at this point and is more likely for
                            the time being to try to exert maximum pressure within the present
                            system to damage the political opposition, or to woo away some of its
                            factions.</p>
                        <p>E. He might at some critical point turn to more drastic measures,
                            including some unconstitutional moves, but would do so only if he were
                            sure that he had neutralized or had the support of the armed forces. The
                            Chilean military are not now disposed to political intervention.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has been assiduously
                            cultivating them to gain their support, and he seems unlikely to provoke
                            them with blatant acts. But domestic events beyond his control, e.g., a
                            deterioration of the economy <pb n="395" facs="0435" xml:id="pg_395"
                            />leading to severe social unrest, could trigger a military attempt to
                            intervene with, or even to oust <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>.</p>
                        <p>F. Thus the consolidation of the Marxist political leadership in Chile is
                            not inevitable, and <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has
                            a long, hard way to go to achieve this. Though he would almost certainly
                            prefer to adhere to constitutional means, he is likely to be impelled to
                            use, and to rationalize, political techniques of increasingly dubious
                            legality; eventually he is likely to feel it necessary to employ his
                            considerable Presidential powers to change the political system so that
                            the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> coalition can perpetuate itself
                            in control. The factors operating for and against this outcome are
                            nearly evenly balanced; the actual outcome could be dictated by quite
                            fortuitous circumstances at some key moment.</p>
                        <p>G. In foreign relations <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            is charting an independent nationalist course for Chile. He is trying to
                            keep open the possibility of credits from European, Japanese and other
                            non-Communist countries. Relations with Communist countries have been
                            expanded and will continue to grow closer. The Soviet Union and other
                            East European states are extending credits and they would probably help
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> in an economic
                            crisis with selective aid measures. Moscow will continue to cultivate
                            channels of influence into <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s government through the Chilean Communist
                            Party, but will be unsure of its ability to make a decisive impact on
                            key issues, given the strong position of the Socialists and <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s independent posture.</p>
                        <p>H. At the moment US-Chilean relations are dominated by the problems of
                            nationalization. There is likely to be considerable contention before
                            the issues are settled and neither the US companies nor the radical
                            Chileans will be satisfied by the terms. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> himself seems to wish to avoid a confrontation,
                            but as economic difficulties set in there will be a continued tendency
                            to use the US as a scapegoat. The US reaction will be important, but at
                            least some worsening in the present cool but correct relationship seems
                            likely.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Since its assumption of power last November, the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government has quickened the
                            pace of ex-President Frei’s “revolution in liberty” begun in 1964 and
                            set in motion a major transformation of the economy and society, posing
                            new challenges to the established political order. The commitment to
                            fundamental social and economic change has won at least the tacit
                            acceptance of most Chileans and the active support of a strong
                            plurality. The desire for such change is a strong factor in the Chilean
                            character, the role of government as a major force in the society is
                            well established, and the importance of private enterprise as an
                            economic norm has eroded greatly over the years. In this <pb n="396"
                                facs="0436" xml:id="pg_396"/>sense, the emergence of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s “people’s revolution” was
                            more a logical fruition of Chile’s past than a sudden historical
                            aberration.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">II. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                                Political Base</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is an astute and
                            experienced politician with a thorough understanding of the Chilean
                            political system gained through years in the Senate and as a perennial
                            presidential candidate. He is a known quantity to the Chilean
                            electorate, regarded as a reformer who has worked within the system all
                            of his political career. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            is 63 years old, and apparently in generally good health despite earlier
                            cardiac problems. He works hard at his job, has a flair for public
                            relations, and is adept at cultivating new supporters and disarming
                            potential opponents. Throughout his first nine months in office, he has
                            shown remarkable tactical skill in sidestepping or suspending problems
                            for which he has not yet devised solutions, in selecting the right
                            allies for immediate purposes, and in keeping his opponents divided. He
                            tends to speak in political cliches and broad theoretical generalities,
                            and has frequently reversed apparent commitments through loopholes or
                            bland disregard of earlier statements. His obvious zest for luxurious
                            living is not regarded in the Chilean context as incompatible with a
                            dedication to Marxist Socialism. A taste for expensive sports cars,
                            liquor, clothes and women, have indeed tended to add lustre to his image
                            rather than damage him politically.</p>
                        <p>3. At this point <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            mandate seems secure, and the disparate elements within his governing
                            Popular Unity (<gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>) coalition appear
                            committed to his overall leadership. The Socialists and Communists are
                            the major coalition partners. Members of the pro-Soviet Chilean
                            Communist Party hold important economic ministerial posts and exercise
                            considerable influence in the government. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s own more nationalistic and in many respects
                            more radical Socialist Party occupies most of the other major cabinet
                            jobs and has particular responsibility for security matters and foreign
                            affairs. Lesser cabinet posts are held by the Radicals, a declining
                            party of non-Marxist middle class orientation, and by three other minor
                            coalition elements. By and large the cabinet is not a particularly
                            distinguished group and is generally overshadowed by <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and by more powerful Socialist
                            and Communist Party leaders.</p>
                        <p>4. The Communists were the main architects of the coalition. Their
                            consistent political line, tight discipline, and considerable
                            organizational talent were key ingredients in <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s election and continue to be
                            valuable assets to him. Outside their own party organizations the
                            Communists’ main channels of political influence are through a network
                            of neighborhood Committees of Popular Unity and the Chilean Trade Union
                            Confederation (<gloss target="#t_CUT_1">CUT</gloss>). The member unions
                            of <gloss target="#t_CUT_1">CUT</gloss> have <pb n="397" facs="0437"
                                xml:id="pg_397"/>various political affiliations, but the Communists
                            are strong in the <gloss target="#t_CUT_1">CUT</gloss> central offices.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has given the
                            Communist Party primary responsibility for labor and has made <gloss
                                target="#t_CUT_1">CUT</gloss> the government’s main instrument in
                            the labor field. The Communists have strong competition from Christian
                            Democratic and Socialist unions in certain key sectors; but their
                            current efforts to increase Communist membership and influence, abetted
                            by Soviet financial and technical support, are likely over time to
                            increase their control of organized labor.</p>
                        <p>5. The Socialist members of the coalition are sometimes at a disadvantage
                            in dealing with the Communists because of the diversity and lack of
                            discipline which have always been characteristics of the Chilean
                            Socialist Party. Many of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                            >Allende</persName>’s Socialist advisors are striving for more militant
                            approaches to national problems and are impatient with the gradualist
                            methods of the Communists and of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>. There are indications, however, that the party
                            leadership is making new efforts to enforce discipline within the ranks,
                            to establish a party line which will appeal to the bulk of the party,
                            and to placate both the old guard members and the extremists on the
                            fringe, the Movement of the Revolutionary Left <gloss target="#t_MIR_1"
                                >MIR</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> is gradually
                            becoming estranged from the Socialist Party and is critical of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s progress toward social
                            goals. More extremist than the <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> is
                            the small People’s Vanguard (<gloss target="#t_VOP_1">VOP</gloss>),
                            which has no ties with any party and is more interested in violence than
                            in revolutionary ideology.</p>
                        <p>6. Despite internal discord, the Socialists capitalized on <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s image to come through the
                            April 1971 municipal elections in much better shape than the well
                            organized Communists. The Socialist Party won 22.4 percent of the vote,
                            as compared with 12.2 percent in the 1969 congressional elections. The
                            Communists advanced only from 15.9 to 17 percent, even though their
                            party membership has increased significantly. The Radicals continued
                            their decade-long decline, dropping from 13 percent to 8 percent. The
                            net result was to increase the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> vote
                            by 5.5 percent over 1969 and give the coalition 49.7 percent of the
                            total vote.</p>
                        <p>7. The Communists and Socialists both endorse the idea of overhauling the
                            Congressional system to neutralize obstructions by the opposition to the
                            government’s policies. The coalition’s plans call for a government
                            legislative proposal to convert the present 50-member Senate and
                            150-member Chamber of Deputies into a single body, to be based on both
                            economic function and political affiliation. Details of the plan are not
                            yet clear, but presumably it would provide for a legislature more easily
                            controlled by the President in which the opposition parties would be
                            less effective.</p>
                        <p>8. There are strains in the coalition over timing and tactics regarding
                            constitutional reform. The Socialists want constitutional change <pb
                                n="398" facs="0438" xml:id="pg_398"/>first, to give the government
                            greater power to force the pace of revolution. The Communists, on the
                            other hand, would prefer to postpone constitutional reform until a good
                            start has been made in tackling the important economic and social tasks
                            and the base for such a fundamental change in the political system has
                            been carefully laid. The <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>’s Political
                            Commission appears to have come closer to the Socialists’ view in
                            calling for government initiatives toward constitutional reform “within
                            the year”. However, the resignation in early August from the Radical
                            Party of nearly half of its Senators and Deputies, and their public
                            opposition to a plebiscite will be a strong deterrent to such government
                            initiatives. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> now seems
                            to look with disfavor on the Socialist insistence on an early
                            plebiscite.</p>
                        <p>9. Despite their differences the Socialists and the Communists have
                            worked together for many years, and we see little short-term prospect of
                            a split serious enough to drive one or the other out of the coalition.
                            The advantages of sharing power are great enough to overcome temporary
                            disappointments. Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> seems adept at presiding over the kind of
                            contention and jostling for position which characterize this coalition.
                            He plays upon the mutual suspicions and inter-party disputes over
                            tactics for his own benefit. For example, last fall he granted amnesty
                            to those members of the <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> who were
                            imprisoned in the Frei era and enlisted the militant enthusiasm of that
                            group in order to sustain, or give the impression of sustaining,
                            revolutionary momentum. More recently, he has joined with the Communists
                            and other “moderates” in attempts to curb the violent excesses of the
                            MIR, e.g., illegal seizures of land and buildings in anticipation of
                            nationalization. Nevertheless, over the longer run difficult decisions
                            on timing and tactics when the coalition attempts to effect
                            consolidation of political control will increase the potential for
                            serious strains.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>10. The most important opposition force, the Christian Democratic Party
                                (<gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>), has been poorly organized,
                            though its efforts have slowed some aspects of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s program. Its most prominent
                            leader, former President Frei, retains a wide following in the country,
                            but he has remained largely in the background and his occasional
                            pronouncements against the governing coalition have yet to be translated
                            into a program capable of uniting the party or offering a popular
                            political alternative. The party remains divided over future strategy. A
                            small but important minority faction, the Christian Left, led by the
                            volatile ideologue <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Radomiro
                                Tomic</persName>, actively supports most of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s social and economic goals
                            and has been seriously considering defection to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> coalition. A larger moderate contingent,
                            led by the capable and energetic Secretary-General Narciso Irureta,
                            appears to be increasingly emphasizing the need for party unity in order
                            to win allies, to oppose <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            <pb n="399" facs="0439" xml:id="pg_399"/>in the Congress, and to work
                            for a <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> victory in the 1973
                            Congressional elections.</p>
                        <p>11. The <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> turned in a respectable
                            performance in the April elections, dropping only from 29.8 percent in
                            1969 to 25.6 percent, and thereby remaining the largest single party.
                            This strengthened Frei’s hand in party affairs and demonstrated the
                            continuing appeal of the party to the Chilean electorate. But Frei
                            characteristically has not displayed dynamic and forceful leadership,
                            and has left the task of trying to maintain the party’s new momentum to
                            Irureta.</p>
                        <p>12. Meanwhile, many members of the radical Christian Left faction believe
                            that if the party is to remain true to its “revolutionary” principles it
                            should help <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> succeed from
                            within the government coalition. But for the moment at least <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> and others appear persuaded that
                            they would lose more than they would gain from defection to <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. However, one faction of the
                            Christian Left has split from the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>
                            in protest against the efforts of the party leadership to cooperate with
                            conservative parties. Most of the party youth leaders and at least 8
                            Deputies resigned. The dissidents will probably join earlier defectors
                            from the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> in a program of selective
                            cooperation with the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            government.</p>
                        <p>13. The majority of the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> seems
                            generally agreed on a policy of “selective opposition” to the
                            government. Under this strategy the party’s leaders will support some
                            government measures, oppose others, and seek to modify still others. It
                            will thus hope to maintain its populist credentials and continue to
                            portray itself as a party committed to profound change.</p>
                        <p>14. There are, however, some formidable obstacles in the way. The <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> has lost the levers of patronage, and
                            its ability to maintain organizational activity and to win new support
                            is weakening. Also, many of its sources of financial backing are drying
                            up in the wake of the government’s moves to nationalize the banking
                            system and as a result of the private sector’s well-founded fear of
                            government retaliation if it supports the opposition. Moreover,
                                <persName corresp="#p_TRR_1">Tomic</persName> and some other <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> leaders still owe a large debt to the
                            state bank from previous years’ borrowings for business ventures and
                            election campaigns, and the party may be vulnerable to government
                            pressures for repayment whenever <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> chooses to turn the screws. Finally, efforts to
                            further its cause and to gain support for alternatives to <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s programs are severely
                            hampered by the growing government domination of the public media.
                            Almost all of the country’s television and about half of the radio
                            stations, the main channels for mass communication, are controlled by
                            the government or the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> coalition; and
                            though one of the major newspapers has managed to maintain its
                            independence, much of the important <pb n="400" facs="0440"
                                xml:id="pg_400"/>printed media either takes its direction from the
                            government or is affiliated with the coalition parties.</p>
                        <p>15. Aside from the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> the only
                            political opposition of any consequence is the National Party (<gloss
                                target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss>), the political vehicle of the
                            landowners and well-to-do. It retained 18 percent of the electorate in
                            the April 1971 elections, down from 20 percent in 1969. But party
                            leadership is inflexible and its program lacks popular appeal. Some
                            elements of the <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss> are willing to work
                            out better political arrangements with the Christian Democrats in order
                            to present <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> with a more
                            united opposition. In the congressional by-election of July 1971 the
                                <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> supported in separate campaigns a single candidate to
                            oppose the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> standard bearer. The
                                <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_PDC_1"

                            interests of the parties are at stake. But the hostility between the

                            sustained collaboration unlikely.</p>
                        <p>16. There will be opportunities for the opposition parties to block,
                            delay, or modify many of the government’s initiatives. Much will depend
                            upon the continued spirit of resistance to the government within the

                        </p>
                        <p>17. Chile’s Armed Forces are among the least inclined of any in Latin
                            America to intervene in politics. After nine months of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> administration there are no
                            indications that the military is about to depart from this tradition.
                            While the officer corps has traditionally been anti-Communist, it has
                            long accepted the legality of the Chilean Communist Party. Few ties
                            exist between military leaders and political figures of the opposition
                            parties. The military continue to see themselves as protectors of
                            national security and defenders of constitutional government.</p>
                        <p>18. Chile’s three armed services, particularly the army, have long been
                            weak in organization, cohesion, and leadership. There is an absence of
                            effective communication and cooperation within the services and with the
                                <hi rend="italic">Carabineros</hi> (national police). The <hi

                            army, are one of the best trained and most professional police forces in
                            Latin America, though after the accession of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> some of the leaders were
                            replaced by less impressive per<pb n="401" facs="0441" xml:id="pg_401"

                            acquiescence would be necessary for a successful military move against
                            the government. They seem no more likely than the military to act
                            against the regime.</p>
                        <p>19. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, for his part, has
                            taken great care not only to observe constitutional forms, but to
                            proclaim frequently his intention to act only within the law in the
                            future. Unlike Frei, he gives military matters his personal attention
                            and has demonstrated to the military that he is interested in, and
                            sympathetic to, their problems, e.g., pay, equipment, and training. In
                            addition, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s recent
                            crackdown on the <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> and his
                            declaration that only the police and the military have the right to be
                            armed are reassuring to the armed forces. Military promotions have been
                            based on normal and expected selections, and are unlikely to arouse any
                            resentment. The military is also benefiting from recent wage increases,
                            lower inflation, and other new arrangements (e.g., free attendance at
                            the Catholic University). Consequently, most military men, although they
                            are not ardent <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            supporters, are willing to give the President a chance to show what his
                            socialist revolution can do for the country.</p>
                        <p>20. Yet, there are circumstances under which the military might unite and
                            impose restrictions upon <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                            >Allende</persName>. Examples would include: a blatantly
                            unconstitutional action by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>, an effort to suppress the opposition by force,
                            or especially a move which the military considered a threat against the
                            armed forces as an institution. All of these contingencies seem unlikely
                            because the President is apparently aware of how far he can go without
                            antagonizing important military figures. There might be developments,
                            however, which he could not control and would lead the military to
                            intervene with, or even attempt to oust <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>: e.g., a deterioration of the Chilean economy,

                        </p>
                        <p>21. During his first nine months in office <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> has directed his economic policies toward his
                            primary objective of building political support for his “people’s
                            revolution”. He has concentrated on fulfilling his electoral promises by
                            the redistribution of income in favor of the underprivileged and by
                            completing the nationalization of the copper industry. To appeal to his
                            more revolutionary followers he has also accelerated agrarian reform and
                            the takeover of major industry and private banks. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has been able to capitalize on
                            the momentum and wide popular support for Frei’s “Chileanization”
                            measures in the late 1960s, under which the government had already
                            acquired majority ownership in the major copper companies. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> decided to seek a
                            constitutional amendment which would allow full nationalization of
                            copper <pb n="402" facs="0442" xml:id="pg_402"/>without judicial review
                            by Chile’s conservative court system. After several months of
                            legislative maneuver and opposition attempts to place restrictions on
                            its implementation, the amendment was passed unanimously by the Congress
                            on 12 July. It provides for compensation to the companies within 30
                            years at no less than 3 percent interest, based on “book value” as of 31
                            December 1970, less possible deduction at the President’s discretion for
                            past “excess profits” and other factors.</p>
                        <p>22. Negotiations with one of the US copper companies, Cerro, have been
                            underway for some time and have produced agreement on terms, but
                            implementation has been stalled by the Socialists in the governing
                            coalition who hope to tighten its provisions in line with the
                            nationalization bill. The government considers that it has a strong
                            claim against the major companies, Anaconda and Kennecott, based on its
                            calculations of “excessive profit-taking” in previous years. Thus there
                            is virtually no chance that the government’s compensation offers will
                            come close to satisfying the companies; each case is likely to be
                            carefully calculated to exact maximum benefits for Chile. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is likely to stop short of
                            outright rejection of compensation and try to avoid terms which would
                            impair Chile’s international standing, but will be under strong pressure
                            from his Socialist Party colleagues to pay no compensation at all.</p>
                        <p>23. Meanwhile the government has proceeded step by step toward state
                            control of other major industries. It has assumed control of nearly all
                            of the nation’s commercial banks through purchases or intervention.
                            Negotiations apparently have been concluded with at least three of the
                            five foreign-owned banks (including US-owned Bank of America) for their
                            “voluntary sale” to the government. In mid-April the government bought
                            out private interests in iron and steel and merged them into a large
                            government-controlled complex. In late May it threatened to take over
                            200 major industrial enterprises, comprising nearly all of Chilean
                            industry, if they did not cooperate with the government’s plans. As a
                            start, it took over the country’s 14 largest textile factories through
                            government-inspired “requisitions” by their workers, an action which the
                            impartial Chilean controller-general declares improper. Major US firms
                            have been the targets of other kinds of government pressures. While
                            negotiations are continuing, <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> is
                            facing ultimate government takeover of its large Chilean investments.
                            Ford Motor Company has already closed down its operation in the country,
                            following heavy losses in recent years and unsuccessful negotiations
                            with the government over its 1971 production. General Motors is hanging
                            on but is likely to experience increasing government interference.</p>
                        <p>24. The government is pushing forward rapidly in land expropriation.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has until recently
                            permitted militant elements to foment seizure of property by landless
                            peasants. He is now discouraging this <pb n="403" facs="0443"

                            the countryside will endanger agricultural production. But the
                            government has not slackened the pace; it claims to have reached its
                            first year’s goal of expropriating 1,000 farms by June 1971. It thus
                            appears determined to forge ahead as quickly as possible toward its
                            objective of breaking up all large landholdings and, ultimately,
                            converting them into a system of agricultural cooperatives and perhaps
                            state farms.</p>
                        <p>25. The government’s program for redistributing income has been a prime
                            source both of its continuing popularity and of its growing
                            vulnerability to economic strains. Chilean workers have received salary
                            increases ranging from 35 to 45 percent, while government controls on
                            prices have held inflation to 11 percent for the first six months of
                            this year, compared with about 24 percent during a similar period in
                            Frei’s last year in office. Since Chileans are conditioned by long
                            experience with inflation to spend their money rapidly, the rise in real
                            income has set off a consumer buying spree. Other “populist”
                            measures—e.g., rent freezes, cheaper vacation costs, reductions in the
                            cost of clothing, and attempts to provide free milk to all children—have
                            greatly increased bread-and-butter benefits to lower class families. The
                            consumer boom and the government’s large spending program have also
                            sharply reduced the number of unemployed, now estimated at 5 percent of
                            the labor force in Santiago Province.</p>
                        <p>26. The economic policies of the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> administration, designed as much to achieve
                            political as economic objectives, have been ambitious and costly, and
                            were bound to create economic problems for the future—as the
                            administration itself almost certainly recognized. Some of these
                            problems have now begun to emerge, and they give promise of worsening.
                            Inflationary pressures are mounting as incomes have expanded much more
                            rapidly than stocks of consumer goods. The rapid pace of nationalization
                            and expanded worker benefits have, moreover, impaired production,
                            virtually eliminated incentives for private investment, and contributed
                            to poor worker discipline and high absentee rates. Greatly increased
                            government spending—the 1971 budget projects a 30 percent increase in
                            expenditures in real terms over the previous year (assuming continuation
                            of inflation at its present rate)—has given a short-term boost to the
                            economy; but production problems, rising costs in the copper industry,
                            and severely depressed profit margins everywhere have inhibited a growth
                            of government revenues. The result is likely to be a 1971 deficit equal
                            to 25–30 percent of expenditures, or 7–8 percent of gross national
                            product (GNP).</p>
                        <p>27. The massive increase in consumer demand is forcing the government to
                            rely increasingly on imports. Disruptions due to accelerated land
                            distribution have begun to threaten agricultural production; plantings
                            of winter wheat are reportedly down substantially this year. <pb n="404"
                                facs="0444" xml:id="pg_404"/>Increased imports of foodstuffs to meet
                            the nation’s growing appetite have more than doubled during

                            Industrial raw material and fuel were only about 8 percent higher but
                            this is because considerable stocks of finished goods, components and
                            raw materials had accumulated during the postelection slump in sales. At
                            the same time, export earnings are down considerably from 1970 as a
                            consequence of lower copper prices and production problems in the mines.
                            Copper expansion programs of recent years have added a potential 40
                            percent to production capacity and export volume. But thus far at least
                            actual production is up only about 8 percent over 1970, and the increase
                            in export volume has not offset lower copper prices.</p>
                        <p>28. At the same time, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            nationalization moves and uncertainty in international money markets
                            about his socialistic goals are drying up sources of foreign credit. The
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government has had
                            little success thus far in its efforts to replace rapidly disappearing
                            short- and medium-term credits from US banks with funds from other
                            non-Communist countries. Heavy debt service payments, unfavorable trade
                            balances, and reduced foreign bank credit have combined to reduce
                            Chile’s net foreign exchange reserves from $345 million to less than
                            $200 million since <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> took
                            office. If he continues on his present course, Chile’s foreign reserves
                            will drop to around $100 million by the end of 1971.</p>
                        <p>29. Despite the dislocations and growing financial squeeze, the overall
                            statistical performance of the economy this year is likely to be good.
                            Increased copper production and continuing strong consumer demand will
                            probably push real economic growth above the 4 percent average of the
                            past four years. Despite large wage increases and a greatly expanded
                            money supply, government controls can be expected to keep the rise in
                            the cost of living below the 30–40 percent level of recent years. It
                            thus appears that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> will
                            have enough leeway and resources to enable him to postpone major
                            economic problems until early 1972.</p>
                        <p>30. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s primary economic
                            problem in 1972 will be a shortage of resources in relation to the
                            demands and appetites he has stimulated. Thus far <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has been able to satisfy this
                            demand mainly by spending resources accumulated by the Frei
                            administration. Domestic production has been augmented by drawing down
                            both foreign reserves and the large stock of finished goods and imports
                            on hand. By 1972, however, both of these will probably be largely
                            depleted, and total supplies will be smaller, perhaps considerably
                            smaller. Although there may be some additional manufacturing output
                            despite capacity bottlenecks and managerial deficiencies, this rise will
                            probably be offset by a decline in agricultural production. Chile
                            already imports <pb n="405" facs="0445" xml:id="pg_405"/>considerable
                            food and, as in most under-developed countries, an expansion of
                            manufacturing output requires an increase in imports. Chile relies
                            heavily on imports not only for finished consumer goods and capital
                            goods, but also for raw materials and fuel.</p>
                        <p>31. The major variable in all this is the prospect for copper export
                            earnings. Chilean copper production is likely to increase next year, but
                            not dramatically. And barring an extended strike in the US copper
                            industry this year, world copper prices are likely to remain at about
                            their current levels, or perhaps decline, over the next six months to a
                                year.<note n="2" xml:id="d78fn2">Prediction of copper prices is
                                extremely hazardous because changes in supply and demand are
                                uncertain and relatively small imbalances can lead to sharp price
                                fluctuations. The copper industry traditionally has had great
                                difficulty adjusting supply to demand because of the long lead time
                                required for new mines, the large individual additions to capacity,
                                and the tendency of producers to start expansion programs at about
                                the same time. This has caused spurts in capacity—often after demand
                                has already peaked. Because of the record high prices that prevailed
                                during most of the mid- and late-1960s, producers initiated a
                                world-wide expansion program that is scheduled to boost mine
                                capacity by 35 percent between 1969 and the end of 1973. At the same
                                time, the slowing of the developed countries’ economies beginning in
                                1969 sharply cut the growth in demand. The result was a sharp drop
                                in copper prices from about 80 cents a pound in early 1970 to less
                                than 50 cents at the end of the year. Since October 1970, prices
                                have ranged between 45 and 55 cents a pound. Although the lower
                                prices probably will lead producers to stretch out the completion of
                                new mines, excess capacity is likely to hold down copper prices
                                until the mid-1970s, unless there is a sizable interruption in
                                supply (such as might be occasioned by a sustained strike, a mine
                                disaster in one of the major producing nations or concurrent action
                                by producing nations to restrict output) or demand grows more
                                rapidly than is now expected. [Footnote is in the original.]</note>
                            We cannot give a precise estimate of the net effect of these factors on
                            the Chilean economy. Under the most favorable conditions, Chile could
                            balance its foreign transactions, but projecting likely production
                            increases and present copper prices, Chile would not earn enough from
                            copper and its other exports to maintain imports at current rates.</p>
                        <p>32. Although no drastic reduction in national output or consumption is in
                            prospect, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> clearly will
                            not be able for much longer to continue to raise living conditions for
                            the mass of the people. Indeed, the balance of payments situation may
                            deteriorate sufficiently to require a squeeze on consumption. Moreover,
                            to the extent that production bottlenecks, import constraints, or new
                            policy emphasis on “building socialism” result in increased investment,
                            consumer welfare will be further circumscribed. If accelerated
                            inflation, black markets, and serious shortages are to be avoided, the
                            government will need to take strong actions such as severely restricting
                            wage increases, raising taxes, and curbing credit expansion. These
                            matters will require difficult decisions, and no matter what steps are
                            taken, they are bound to be politically unpopular.</p>
                        <p>33. In an attempt to avoid restricting consumption or to minimize the
                            effect, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> will look for
                            more outside aid. Most Western sources <pb n="406" facs="0446"
                                xml:id="pg_406"/>would be wary of extending large-scale assistance,
                            but it is possible that some new credits or joint ventures would be
                            forthcoming from European, Japanese, or international financial or
                            industrial sources. Probably the Communist countries would be more
                            promising sources. Although the Soviets have been careful to avoid heavy
                            commitments to Chile, and have counseled caution in economic matters,
                            they would probably help <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            with selective aid measures.</p>

                        <p>34. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has developed a
                            cautious and flexible posture in foreign affairs. Connections with the
                            Communist world have become closer and more numerous, for economic as
                            well as ideological reasons. The government’s economic policies and
                            measures against foreign business interests in the country have strained
                            relations with the US and raised doubts in other non-Communist countries
                            over <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s reliability as a
                            credit risk and trading partner. But <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> has been careful not to subordinate Chilean
                            interests to any Communist or socialist power or to break existing ties
                            with those in the non-Communist world on whom he continues to rely for
                            aid. The new pattern reflects <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s desire to chart an independent nationalist
                            course for Chile both within the hemisphere and on the world stage.</p>
                        <p>35. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has now established
                            relations with most Communist countries in the world, including Cuba,
                            Mongolia, East Germany, and Mainland China. But Moscow’s obvious
                            approval of the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            government and its goals has been restrained and guarded. The Soviets
                            are aware that excessive enthusiasm would increase fears of Soviet
                            intentions elsewhere in the hemisphere and might make things more
                            difficult for the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            government, possibly even leading to its isolation in the hemisphere à
                            la Cuba. Moscow will continue to cultivate channels of influence into
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s government through
                            the Chilean Communist Party. But it will probably be unsure of its
                            ability to make a decisive impact on key issues, given the continuing
                            strong position of the Communists’ rivals, the Socialists, in the
                            governing coalition and <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                            >Allende</persName>’s evident desire for an independent posture.</p>
                        <p>36. For his part <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> will
                            hope to use his new contacts with the Communist world to take up the
                            slack in the Chilean economy left by reduced aid and investments from
                            non-Communist sources. Recent visits by high-level Chilean emissaries to
                            the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have in fact advanced new
                            possibilities for increased aid and trade. The Soviet Union has
                            increased credits for Chilean purchases of machinery and equipment from
                            $55 million (extended to the Frei government in 1967 and never used), to
                            $95 million. Other credits for equipment purchases have been granted by
                            Bulgaria and Hungary, and it seems likely that other East European
                            countries will follow suit.</p>
                        <pb n="407" facs="0447" xml:id="pg_407"/>
                        <p>37. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government has
                            followed a similar pattern of ideological distance and closer economic
                            ties with Cuba. Despite their long-standing personal relationship,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has refrained from
                            excessive overtures to <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel
                                Castro</persName>. There has been some increase in trade between the
                            two countries, and official and unofficial contacts have increased,
                            including a new direct airline connection. The number of Cubans serving
                            in their embassy in Chile has risen to 46, and other Cubans serve as
                            advisors in various fields. Still, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> appears concerned that too close relations with
                                <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName> at this stage
                            may cause him difficulties with his still suspicious Latin American
                            neighbors, and upset the delicate political balance between pro-Moscow
                            Communists and pro-<persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName>
                            Socialists in his governing coalition. He therefore seems likely to
                            continue his present policy of careful cordiality toward <persName
                                corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName>.</p>
                        <p>38. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is hoping to calm the
                            fears of some of his neighbors that Chile’s revolution might spill over
                            Chile’s borders and undermine their governments. Thus far, the reactions
                            have been mixed. Relations with Brazil’s military government remain
                            strained, mainly because of its suspicions of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s receptivity to acceptance of
                            Brazilian political exiles. The <persName corresp="#p_LAA_1"
                                >Lanusse</persName> government in Argentina responded favorably to
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s overtures to
                            maintain cordial relations but remains suspicious that the Soviets may
                            be gaining a foothold in Chile or that terrorists may use Chile as a
                            base for operations against Argentina. In recent weeks Chile and
                            Argentina have agreed on a formula for arbitration of their
                            long-standing dispute over the Beagle Channel, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_LAA_1">Lanusse</persName> and <persName

                            “solemnize” the occasion. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> initiated discussions with Bolivia looking
                            toward a resumption of diplomatic relations, but the longstanding issue
                            of Bolivia’s claim to a port on the Pacific has continued to block
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>39. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is apparently
                            planning to follow up his Argentina visit with trips to Peru, Ecuador,
                            and Colombia, in the hope of improving relations with those countries.
                            In several Latin American countries <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s admirers are hoping to emulate his experiment
                            with similar leftist political fronts of their own. The <hi
                                rend="italic">Frente Amplio,</hi> an Uruguayan popular front, is
                            preparing to campaign in the national elections in November. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is likely to encourage such
                            efforts when he feels he can do so without incurring the wrath of other
                            governments. Relations with Uruguay remain touchy, however, primarily
                            because of the Pacheco government’s concern that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s granting of safe haven to
                            Uruguay’s Tupamaro terrorists may give the group an outside base for
                            operating against Uruguay. But <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> will probably continue to deny any significant
                            assistance to the Tupamaros or other terrorist groups in and outside
                            Chile. On balance, his dedication to developing a socialist state in
                            Chile will probably outweigh pressures he might feel to provide active
                            or open support to revolutionary activists in other Latin American
                            countries.</p>
                        <pb n="408" facs="0448" xml:id="pg_408"/>
                        <p>40. In regional organizations the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> government has taken more independent positions
                            vis-à-vis the US and, in some cases, adopted policies at odds with US
                            interests. Within the Andean Pact—a regional group which includes
                            Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru—Chile has, along with Peru, been a
                            strong advocate of stiff restrictions on new foreign investments in the
                            area. At the hemispheric level, however, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> has been careful not to strain traditional ties.
                            He has continued to participate actively in regional economic and
                            political arrangements. Within the councils of the Organization of
                            American States (<gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>) the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government favors bringing
                            Cuba back into the Latin American community. But it has not lobbied
                            actively on Cuba’s behalf there, partly in deference to <persName
                                corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName>’s own clear rejection of
                                <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> membership and partly in order
                            to avoid a confrontation with the US at this stage. Elsewhere, e.g., in
                            the various bodies of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and in the

                            the Cuban cause.</p>

                        <p>41. The problems faced by the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> government will become increasingly critical
                            over the next two years or so. The various challenges which it will have
                            to face and its responses to those challenges in this period will
                            probably shape the pattern of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s policies through the end of his term in 1976.
                            They will also go far toward determining whether his <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> coalition can retain its unity
                            throughout his term and what its prospects, legal or illegal, for longer
                            perpetuation of power may be.</p>
                        <p>42. At this point <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> enjoys
                            considerable popularity. His statist, nationalist, and populist measures
                            have fulfilled most of his campaign promises for quick reforms in the
                            areas where there was little political opposition. But, his dilemma is
                            that, having done all the easy things, he has still not gained
                            sufficient political strength to carry him surely through the difficult
                            times which clearly lie ahead. The results of the April municipal
                            elections and the July by-election in Valparaíso indicate that he cannot
                            count on the support of a majority of the Chilean electorate.</p>
                        <p>43. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is aware of the
                            likelihood of economic stringencies in Chile within the next year or so.
                            He is worried about inflation, the disruption of agricultural production
                            brought on by the land expropriations, and the prospect of serious
                            shortages. He will probably be obliged to turn soon to greater controls
                            over foreign exchange, foreign trade, and the internal distribution of
                            goods and services. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            Economics Minister, a doctrinaire Marxist, talks in terms of a shift
                            toward accumulation, by which he seems to imply an enforced type of
                            consumer austerity in order to build state capital for investment in <pb
                                n="409" facs="0449" xml:id="pg_409"/>heavy industry and agriculture.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> probably has no
                            specific blueprint in mind and is more likely to make pragmatic
                            responses to his economic problems as they arise. As stringent actions
                            become necessary, he will attempt to shift the main burden on to the
                            propertied and well-to-do classes and on whatever foreign interests
                            remain. No matter how artfully <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> deals with the economic problem, he will
                            probably not be able to maintain for very long an increased flow of
                            those consumer goods which the underprivileged classes are now beginning
                            to enjoy. His popularity therefore seems almost certain to decline as
                            the economic problems set in.</p>
                        <p>44. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is also exposed to
                            pressures from within the coalition both to speed the pace of social
                            reform while there is still revolutionary momentum, and to shore up the
                            regime politically while the euphoria of copper nationalizations and
                            income redistribution lasts. Many of his associates stress the
                            irreversibility of the Marxist socialist state as a primary aim. By
                            this, they presumably mean the attainment of a monopoly of power by the
                            ruling coalition and the extension of rule beyond the scheduled 1976
                            presidential elections. A more imminent obstacle is the 1973
                            congressional election. Many in the coalition would like to avoid the
                            1973 hurdle and pave the way to their own extension of power by
                            replacing Congress as soon as possible with a unicameral “People’s
                            Assembly” in which functional economic groups—controllable by the <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>—would be strongly represented. If
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> chooses, he could
                            submit such a bill to Congress, wait for the lengthy debate, revision,
                            stalling and rejection which the opposition can undoubtedly accomplish,
                            and then submit the plan to the people in a plebiscite.</p>
                        <p>45. But <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> clearly sees a
                            plebiscite as a risky matter. The April 1971 municipal elections and the
                            July by-election indicate that he now has the support of only about half
                            of the electorate. A rejected plebiscite would be a body blow to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government. On the
                            other hand, there are risks if he waits too long. If economic
                            difficulties set in within a year, as seems likely, many of those who
                            now support his populist program will be estranged, and the chances of
                            carrying off a plebiscite would be reduced. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> had been leaning toward a plebiscite before the
                            July vote in Valparaíso. While he may submit a bill to Congress in the
                            next few months we think he will delay any final decision on a
                            plebiscite till he can judge his chances more accurately at the last
                            minute.</p>
                        <p>46. There are other tactics, perhaps slower but less risky than the
                            plebiscite route, for tilting the political balance in Chile toward a
                            continuation of a Marxist coalition government. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has already taken steps to
                            undermine the financial basis of the opposition parties. His increasing
                            control of the banks and the economy give him further leverage to use
                            for political purposes. And he can at any time step up a muckraking
                            campaign against Christian Democratic leaders or try to <pb n="410"
                                facs="0450" xml:id="pg_410"/>blackmail them. Some of them benefited
                            from shady deals and corrupt practices during the Frei era, and are
                            vulnerable to public exposure. This would not eliminate the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>, but there would be considerable
                            confusion and loss of confidence among the party faithful. In addition,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> could do more damage
                            to the opposition by further curbing their access to the media. We would
                            expect more activity along these lines as the 1973 congressional
                            election draws near or if he decides to go for a plebiscite. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> will certainly also make
                            strong efforts to attract left-wing Christian Democrats into his
                            coalition and will probably have some successes.</p>
                        <p>47. If, however, at some critical point such as the campaign for the 1973
                            congressional election or in the face of serious social unrest,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> judges that his own
                            political posture or that of his coalition is sagging badly and the
                            tactics described above are insufficient, he might turn to more drastic
                            measures. These might include a much tighter grip over the media,
                            intimidation or selective violence against political foes, and perhaps
                            some unconstitutional moves to undercut the political opposition. But in
                            taking such drastic actions <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> would run a high risk of alienating a large
                            sector of the Chilean people who may agree with his economic and social
                            reforms, but would resist any obvious effort to overthrow Chile’s
                            democratic institutions. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            could, therefore, undertake such moves only if he were reasonably sure
                            that the armed forces, including the <hi rend="italic">Carabineros</hi>,
                            were supporting him or were effectively neutralized. Resistance to
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> by even a few units
                            of the army could upset the whole program by providing a focus of
                            civilian and armed opposition to the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>,
                            and this could lead to massive confusion with uncertain results.</p>
                        <p>48. Thus the consolidation of Marxist political leadership in Chile is
                            not inevitable and <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has a
                            long way to go to achieve this. Even if he makes maximum use of his
                            political talents and is able by skill and luck to thread his way
                            through the economic and political obstacle course ahead of him, it will
                            not be easy to reach the point where he can turn the government over to
                            a trusted colleague who will continue his policies. We believe that he
                            will manage to hold his coalition together during the critical years
                            immediately ahead, although some deft maneuvering will undoubtedly be
                            required. Almost inevitably, however, he will come under growing
                            pressures to depart from constitutional precedures in order to press
                            ahead with his basic programs. Though he would almost certainly prefer
                            to adhere to constitutional means, he is likely to be impelled to use,
                            and to rationalize, political techniques of increasingly dubious
                            legality; eventually he is likely to feel it necessary to employ his
                            considerable Presidential powers to change the political system so that
                            the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> coalition can perpetuate itself
                            in control. The factors operating for and against this outcome are
                            nearly evenly bal<pb n="411" facs="0451" xml:id="pg_411"/>anced; the
                            actual outcome could be dictated by quite fortuitous circumstances at

                        <p>49. In many respects the economic changes which <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has set in motion already
                            appear irreversible. The nationalization program, the land reforms, and
                            many of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s efforts toward
                            redistribution of national income in favor of the underprivileged are
                            not likely to be changed by any successor government. Though economic
                            stringencies lie ahead and some politically unpopular moves are probably
                            necessary, there is no indication that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> will be deterred from the main lines of his
                            socialist program. Moreover the electorate, including the middle class,
                            accepts socialism. It is still not clear exactly what <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has in mind for the economy
                            when he says his purpose is to build a “revolutionary, nationalistic,
                            and socialist society on Marxist principles”. He evidently wants a
                            centrally planned and directed economy of some kind with the major
                            industries controlled by the State but he has repeatedly asserted that
                            the private sector will not be eliminated.</p>
                        <p>50. No matter what Chile’s political and economic structure turns out to
                            be, its relations with the Communist countries are certain to become
                            closer. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> will not want to
                            tie Chile too tightly to any one Communist state, but his concept of
                            Chilean independence suggests expanded relations in a variety of
                            contexts, e.g., more cultural, economic, and political exchanges. In
                            international gatherings Chile is likely to support a number of
                            Communist stands, which the US will find irritating. Chile is less
                            likely to seek large-scale military aid from the Communists partly
                            because the equipment desired by the Chilean Armed Forces is obtainable
                            in the West, partly because the military leaders in Chile prefer to deal
                            with Western military establishments, and partly because <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> sees no advantage in
                            needlessly antagonizing the US in such a sensitive matter as Western
                            Hemisphere security. If the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> were
                            to request maintenance facilities for its navy in Chilean ports,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would probably find
                            it difficult to oppose, given his probable need for Soviet economic
                            help. But we doubt that he, or the Chilean military establishment, would
                            tolerate a permanent Soviet military presence in the country.</p>
                        <p>51. At the moment US-Chilean relations are dominated by the problems of
                            nationalization. Some of these will be disposed of within the next year
                            or so, but not without considerable wrangling. Some US companies will
                            not be satisfied with the terms, nor will some of the more radical
                            Chileans. There is likely to be considerable disputation and contention
                            in the process of nationalization of US investments. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> himself seems to wish to avoid
                            a confrontation with the US, if possible, probably because he hopes to
                            keep the door open to at least limited US Government assistance and to
                            prevent active lobbying by the US against Chile in the international
                            financial field. But Chilean of<pb n="412" facs="0452" xml:id="pg_412"
                            />ficials, including occasionally <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> himself, are prone to blame the US for a variety
                            of adverse developments. As economic difficulties set in the tendency
                            will be to continue to use the US as a scapegoat for a host of Chilean
                            domestic problems. The US reaction to this, and the general US posture,
                            will be important, but at least some worsening in the present cool but
                            correct relationship seems likely.</p>
                        <p>52. Apart from the nationalization issue there will be several other
                            areas of considerable concern to the US, particularly the possibility of
                            enhanced Soviet influence in Chile, and the repercussions elsewhere in
                            Latin America of the Chilean example. The latter problem could be
                            especially significant in terms of the tactics of radicals elsewhere in
                            the hemisphere. Youth, labor, intellectuals and other such groups will
                            look to Chile for inspiration. A leftist front on the Chilean model is
                            already organized in Uruguay to participate in this fall’s election. It
                            has little chance of winning, but if it attracts a substantial minority
                            of the Uruguayan electorate, it will encourage the formation of similar
                            fronts elsewhere, e.g., in Colombia or Argentina.</p>
                        <p>53. Less tangible will be the general psychological effect on Latin
                            Americans over the next few years of the Chilean style of independence.
                            This may have a greater impact on sensitive nationalist leaders and
                            peoples in Latin America than the Marxist experiments in Chile. We would
                            expect some other Latin regimes, even some fairly conservative ones, to
                            pay closer attention to Santiago, and to join with Chile on some
                            hemisphere issues. On such matters as the 200-mile maritime limit,
                            commodity trading agreements, and the terms of aid, many Latin American
                            states are at odds with the US. There are certain to be other issues
                            which will widen the gulf between the US and Latin American states, and
                            Chilean attitudes in these matters may reinforce the tendency of other
                            nations to turn away from close relations with the US.</p>

                                <p>Summary: During this conversation, U.S. officials and businessmen
                                    from the Anaconda Company discussed different means of
                                    negotiating with the Chileans over the amount of compensation
                                    that they would receive for their nationalized properties. The
                                    representatives from Anaconda expressed concern over the
                                    potentially damaging effects nationalization could have on U.S.
                                    investments in Latin America and proposed that the U.S.
                                    Government require just compensation.</p>

                        <p>The Anaconda representatives called upon the Under Secretary to review
                            the current situation in Chile as it relates to expropriation under the
                            copper bill and to express their concern about the recent developments.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJ_4">Place</persName> noted his view that the
                            situation was extremely serious and was moving increasingly against
                            Anaconda’s interests, and that unless something was done to arrest this
                            movement, a very negative Chilean position might become inextricably set
                            in concrete. He noted that Anadonda had seen a number of other people
                            today, including Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRS_1">McNamara</persName> of
                            the <gloss target="#t_IBRD_1">IBRD</gloss>, to explore the possible need
                            for other solutions to the Chilean problem. Among other dimensions of
                            this problem he saw the possibility that Chile might move out of the
                            sphere of influence of the United States and that given its role as a
                            major metals producer for the world, this could imply difficulties for
                            efforts of the U.S. to obtain vitally necessary metals resources. He
                            also saw a damaging effect on other Anaconda investments in the Latin
                            American areas and throughout the world. He had brought Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_QWE_1">Quigley</persName>, therefore, to describe
                            briefly to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName> the present
                            situation in Chile as Anaconda judges it.</p>
                        <pb n="414" facs="0454" xml:id="pg_414"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QWE_1">Quigley</persName> stated that in the
                            last six weeks, and increasingly in the last three weeks, the situation
                            in Chile was deteriorating significantly to the left, both in general
                            terms and particularly in terms of the Chilean Government’s attitude
                            toward compensation for copper. He felt <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> had underestimated the power of the more radical
                            elements of his Marxist coalition and was experiencing serious
                            difficulties in carrying forward his own intentions. An example of these
                            difficulties was the delay in signing the Cerro agreement, where the
                            government had been persuaded to delay finalization until the copper
                            bill was passed and had not yet found a way of signing the agreement. He
                            also reported that this radical left had overpowered the Communist bloc
                            of the coalition (which he described as relatively more tractable and a
                            strong supporter of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            strategy), and had precluded the possibility of a veto of the bill which
                                <persName corresp="#p_QWE_1">Quigley</persName> had foreseen as an
                            opportunity to delay final passage of the bill and provide additional
                            time for a more reasonable arrangement between the U.S. copper companies
                            and the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> regarding compensation. In
                            recent weeks, under pressure from this radical left the tone of the
                            political environment in Chile had changed considerably, evidenced both
                            by the tone of press coverage and <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s own statements, with growing focus on claims
                            of unsatisfactory conditions of equipment and processes at the mine
                            sites and the high cost of necessary repairs to maintain current or
                            achieve expanded production. This he felt was based on misinformation
                            being fed to the press and to the political structure by the radical
                            left. He then described in some detail the compensation process provided
                            for under the copper bill and concluded that under present circumstances
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has no alternative
                            but to apply some factor of excess profit deduction to the valuation
                            established by the controller. The Anaconda representatives noted their
                            interpretation of the bill that such excess profits could be determined
                            only by one of three formulae: (a) the amount by which earnings from
                            their Chilean investments exceed earnings from other international
                            operations; (b) the 14% return provided for under the Andean Code, or
                            (c) the over price formula established in the 1969 agreement under which
                            Anaconda sold out 51% of its Chilean holdings to the Government of
                            Chile. Any one of these formulations will result, according to the
                            Anaconda representatives, in a deduction of $150 to $200 million from
                            the depreciated book value being determined by the controller. Other
                            deductions could come from judgments of unsatisfactory conditions of
                            equipment or processes at the mine. Examples of such deductions being
                            stressed in the publicity campaigns of the press include: (a) high
                            grading in the stripping, particularly at Chuquicamata, which might lead
                            to a claim of $30 million; (b) non-accountability for precious metal
                            content of the ore during past years, claimed to have cost the Chilean
                            Government $40 million and which if applied would be subject to a factor
                            of 5 as a fine ($200 mil<pb n="415" facs="0455" xml:id="pg_415"/>lion);
                            (c) claims related to alleged windfalls from past exchange rate
                            benefits, said to amount to $6 million, and others. These were set forth
                            merely as examples of the kinds of tactics being generated by the
                            radical left of the Unidad Popular to justify a negative compensation,
                            including honoring of the $150 million in Codelco notes provided to
                            Anaconda under the 1969 buy-out. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QWE_1"
                                >Quigley</persName> noted that 3 payments had been made on those
                            notes, the last one having been made on June 30 and the next one being
                            due on December 31.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QWE_1">Quigley</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJ_4">Place</persName> both noted their serious concern
                            with the break in continuity of U.S. ambassadorial support to the
                            company’s efforts that will be occasioned by the impending change in
                            Ambassadors. They noted that they had worked extremely closely with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> and were most
                            appreciative of his efforts, but they also noted that he had been absent
                            for some time due to the tragic illness of his father and that even when
                            he returns it will be as a lame duck, since his departure has already
                            been announced. This they feel vitiates much of his potential influence
                            in the government. They also noted that at this critical stage the
                                <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> is on vacation and the Embassy
                            has thus been left in the charge of the third man down, who himself has
                            only been in Chile for about 3½ months. They stressed their serious
                            concern for the lack of adequate presence at this crucial time, and a
                            fear that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> might interpret the
                            change of Ambassadors and the absence of key U.S. representatives from
                            Santiago as an indication of relative disinterest. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJ_4">Place</persName> suggested that this potential
                            conclusion by the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> might be offset,
                            the hardening of the Chilean negotiating position softened, and a fresh
                            impetus toward satisfactory agreement provided, by the naming of a
                            special and very high level envoy to Chile. The timing of such a visit,
                            he felt, was of critical importance since the clock put in motion by the
                            promulgation of the copper bill was running and critical Chilean
                            determinations as to compensation and terms were in process of
                            development. There is thus great danger that basic decisions are already
                            in process, to which <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            will find himself hostage. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJ_4"
                                >Place</persName> noted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRS_1"
                                >McNamara</persName> in their discussion had shared this concern.
                            The Anaconda representatives recognized, of course, the inherent
                            limitations in the big club approach, but if the Chilean approach was
                            steadfastly unreasonable, then a very hard position on international
                            credit availabilities by the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would
                            become inevitable. The Anaconda representatives preferred, however, that
                            an approach might be possible that would permit a quid pro quo
                            calculation on both sides. They noted that Chilean financial needs for
                            completed expansion and operational improvements of their copper mines
                            totaled perhaps $300 million alone, and they reported that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRS_1">McNamara</persName> had indicated that if there
                            were adequate agreement on both sides on the copper compensation issue,
                            the <gloss target="#t_IBRD_1">IBRD</gloss> would be sympathetic to
                            taking part in a financing arrangement that promised productive
                            results.</p>
                        <pb n="416" facs="0456" xml:id="pg_416"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName> asked the Anaconda
                            representatives what they saw as alternative possibilities in dealing
                            with this problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QWE_1">Quigley</persName>
                            indicated that some formulation could be a restatement of U.S. policy
                            toward just compensation and a request for useful assurances from
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> that such policy
                            would be honored, in return for which there would be the possibility of
                            financing through the <gloss target="#t_IDB_1">IDB</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_IBRD_1">IBRD</gloss>, Eximbank, etc. of justifiable
                            Chilean projects, and if such assurances were not obtainable and
                            reasonable compensation not forthcoming, the U.S. would take all
                            appropriate steps to deny new credits to Chile. This sort of approach,
                            he felt, and a slow down in the Chilean process of calculating
                            compensation, might provide additional time necessary to work out an
                            arrangement which, though far from optimum, would at least avoid
                            completely confiscatory actions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QWE_1">Quigley</persName> then explored some of
                            the parameters of Anaconda’s view of compensation, most of which is
                            included in the paper left behind, a copy of which is attached. <hi
                                rend="italic">Inter alia</hi> this paper notes Anaconda’s view that
                            the 1969 agreement, had it been carried out, would have produced
                            something between $550 and $750 million for the 100% purchase of
                            Anaconda’s holdings, compared to Anaconda’s own calculation of a total
                            value, including ore reserves, of about $1.3 billion. This, they felt,
                            would be a reasonable price of a willing seller to a willing buyer in
                            the United States. <hi rend="italic">Inter alia</hi> the Anaconda
                            representatives indicated that while return on investment might be
                            calculated differently by the Chileans and by the company, their figures
                            would show a return on equity investment for the total 1916 to 1969
                            period of 9.7% at Chuqui (with an equity investment of $162 million),
                            and 4.42% at Salvador (with an equity investment of $80 million). This
                            return, they noted, had been noticeably better since 1955 and had
                            reached $100 million in 1968. Over that full period of time, however,
                            the Anaconda holdings had produced $6.3 billion, of which $5.5 billion,
                            or more than 88%, had been returned to Chile in the form of taxes,
                            earnings, etc.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName> asked what a high level
                            mediator might do that had not already been done, and Mr. Cutler said
                            that perhaps he could press home with finality the message that we had
                            been signalling, that is, convince the Chileans that we mean what we say
                            about the implications of non-compensation. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName> asked if this would be useful,
                            in view of Anaconda’s feeling that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> was now captive to his radical left. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName> asked if the Anaconda
                            representatives felt that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> was basically disposed toward a reasonable
                            solution. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QWE_1">Quigley</persName> said yes,
                            that he thought <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> was on
                            the right side of his admittedly leftist coalition, and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJ_4">Place</persName> said that the situation really
                            called for a dramatic gesture if confiscation were to be avoided. The
                            latter, he noted, would in any case hit the U.S. tax payer because there
                            would be large tax carry-forwards by Anaconda and large <gloss

                            these would directly or indirectly have to be footed by the <gloss

                                >Irwin</persName> asked what time period Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJ_4">Place</persName> saw for his proposal, and he
                            replied that the need was indeed critical, that had such a man been
                            named he should be leaving immediately, although he recognized that some
                            spadework would have to be done to make full use of his trip, and that
                            in any case, it now being confirmed that Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> would be leaving, then the
                            sooner the new Ambassador got there the better. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FMB_1">Feldman</persName> noted that the Anaconda
                            proposal called for an approach to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>, but that the immediate process of valuation was
                            being carried out by the controller, who is a quasi-independent official
                            of Chile, and that there would be some delicacy in maintaining this
                            distinction. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QWE_1">Quigley</persName> agreed
                            that this was a complication, but did not feel it overrode the
                            importance of getting some message through to <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> which would slow down the
                            Chilean decision-making process and give <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> some basis for holding off such radical leftists
                            as Faivovich and <persName corresp="#p_AOC_1">Altamirano</persName>. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJ_4">Place</persName> noted that in order to
                            do this <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would have to be
                            armed with some quid pro quo, and that the quid would be access to
                            credit since Chilean officials are becoming increasingly seized with the
                            seriousness of their credit standing. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1"
                                >Irwin</persName> asked if the Anaconda officials were aware of the
                            attitude of the other copper companies toward the present situation, and
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QWE_1">Quigley</persName> noted that
                            unfortunately each case was quite different, Cerro being a new
                            investment with essentially no returns at all to date, and Kennecott in
                            a position of having none of their own money invested and their loan
                            fully insured (but he believed that Kennecott might in a final analysis

                        <p>1. Summary. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> returns today
                            from what he believes to be an extraordinarily successful Andean tour.
                            The homecoming staging appears to herald a major effort to make the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> administration the
                            scapegoat for growing internal problems. <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> Marxist leadership appears confident that it can
                            maneuver the US into major policy changes as it prepares to receive
                                <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName> here. So far it
                            has displayed no interest in proposals that by any objective reading
                            would be extremely attractive ways for the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> to resolve the <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss>,
                            Kennecott and Anaconda problems; instead it is forcing unilaterally the
                            pace against the companies and against the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                >Nixon</persName> administration as part of a general quickening of
                            the revolutionary tempo within Chile now that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has won full respectability
                            from almost all LatAm. Nonetheless the US must continue to support and
                            to seek pragmatic settlements, maintaining a hermetic silence whatever
                            the provocation during the next month of decision. There is little
                            reason to believe the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> would heed an
                            Anaconda petition for more time (State 158502), particularly when Cerro
                            and Kennecott are opposed to that idea, but we would provide official
                            support to such company action here. The copper compensation will be
                            determined politically. As for <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss>’s
                            contract with <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> (State 160408), a
                            belated reversal of <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss> policy at
                            this juncture could very easily be misread by <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> as a signal of more important
                            impending changes in US policy towards Chile; hence if <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> shows any pragmatic interest in
                            negotiation, the contract could be introduced at that time if it really
                            proved to have any substantive impact on <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss>. End summary. </p>

                        <p>What immediate adjustments should we be prepared to make in our policy on
                            Chile as the question of compensation for expropriated U.S. investments
                            comes to a head?</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                            <hi rend="roman">I.</hi> Situation</p>
                        <p>Our policy toward Chile as established last November sets forth two basic
                            purposes: To avoid giving the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> government a basis on which to rally domestic
                            and international support; but to maximize pressures on that government
                            to prevent its consolidation and limit its ability to implement policies
                            contrary to U.S. and hemispheric interests.</p>
                        <p>We have had fairly good success in carrying out this policy in both
                            respects, up to now. The credibility of our correct but cool public
                            posture has occasionally been attacked, principally by those who from
                            the outset viewed skeptically our assertions in this regard, but in
                            general, both in Chile and elsewhere, our posture has been considered
                            correct in both senses of the word. Until the recent advent of the
                            Eximbank-Boeing matter, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            could find in our actions and policies no effective basis for rallying
                            support.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, economic pressures began to take effect. The caution of
                            financial sources around the world was by no means due exclusively to
                            our efforts, and many of the economic problems confronting the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government are visibly of its
                            own making.</p>
                        <p>Within the broad scope of strategic choices lying before us in
                            determining our relations with Chile is an interest in protecting
                            legitimate rights of U.S. investors and of protecting direct U.S.
                            Treasury interests in about $1 billion in debt to <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> entities and over $312 million

                        <p>Through our good offices we have assisted over the past several months in
                            the consummation of several buy-out agreements between smaller U.S.
                            investors and the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The outlook for a satisfactory outcome on compensation for the major U.S.
                            investors, Anaconda, Kennecott, <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> and
                            possibly Cerro, has never been encouraging and has worsened in recent
                            weeks. The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> has chosen to make a
                            public issue of Eximbank’s hesitation to finance Boeing aircraft until
                            it is satisfied concerning various aspects of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>’s creditworthiness, including its
                            intentions on compensation. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s increasingly strong and critical declarations
                            against “economic coercion,” picking up the Eximbank loan question and
                            on the eve of his compensation decisions, suggest that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> is embarked on the course of
                            attempting to justify limited or no compensation, and to pin the blame
                            on the U.S. both for Chile’s economic problems and for any deterioration
                            in U.S.-Chilean relations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has also publicly stated
                            that the U.S.G.’s new economic measures, by “changing the rules”, in
                            effect strengthen Chile’s case for not paying compensation and
                            underscore her right, no less than that of large nations, to take steps
                            to protect her economy.</p>
                        <p>Chilean Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> has
                            requested an appointment with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> to present him with a letter from Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_AMC_1">Almeyda</persName> and with a
                            letter from <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>. While both letters
                            are virtually certain to touch on the expropriation question, nothing
                            more is known about their contents. (On September 7 he asked for
                            postponement of his appointment with the Secretary on the same day,

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>’s copper expropriation bill
                            (since July 16 part of the Chilean Constitution) basically calls for
                            compensation to be set at depreciated book value (to be calculated by
                            Chile’s autonomous Comptroller General), including deductions for
                            equipment either obsolete or in poor condition, plans or spare parts
                            withheld, etc. In addition, the President may calculate a further
                            deduction for “excess profits” taken by the companies since 1955. The
                            terms of payment (i.e. number of years and interest rate) are also to be
                            established by the President within the limits of a 30-year maximum and
                            a 3% minimum.</p>
                        <p>Thus, as the U.S. copper companies have pointed out, there is no
                            possibility that compensation will be “adequate” in the sense of
                            representing a true “going concern” value. In that it would be
                            politically extremely difficult for <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> to take the position that <hi rend="italic"
                                >no</hi> excess profits had been taken by the companies, the
                            prospect is that Chile will provide something even less than book
                            value.</p>
                        <p>Within the limits imposed by the constitutional amendment, both <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and the Comptroller General
                            retain the capacity to come up <pb n="421" facs="0461" xml:id="pg_421"
                            />with a settlement that could range from zero (or worse) to something
                            approaching book value. According to our calculations, the maximum that
                            could be awarded under the law would be in the area of $85 million for
                            Kennecott and some $205 million for Anaconda. Cerro has been promised
                            $56 million.</p>
                        <p>Current indications are that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                            intends to complete the process by October 14. The companies would then
                            have 15 days in which to lodge their only possible appeal, to the
                            special tribunal provided for in the law. Three of the tribunal’s five
                            members are presidential appointees. There are no time limits on its
                            deliberations. See Attachment 1 for the time schedule under the copper
                            amendment.</p>

                            compensation, to be made in the next 2–3 weeks, will reflect its
                            appreciation of its political and economic needs, both domestic and
                            international. Strengthening its hand are the propaganda successes of
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s recent tour and
                            the appeal of economic nationalism both in Chile and elsewhere in Latin
                            America. Suggesting caution to the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                            are its growing economic problems and its evident awareness that its
                            international creditworthiness, its access to its traditional financial
                            sources, stands to be adversely affected by its position on
                            compensation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> has been active
                            in drawing the attention of the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> to
                            the advantages of pragmatic solutions on compensation, and in suggesting
                            practical ways of moving toward them. To date, the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> has displayed no interest in pursuing
                            any of these possibilities.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, Anaconda has suggested to the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> the possible utility of giving a positive signal
                            conveyed through official channels or a third party intermediary, on the
                            economic benefit to Chile of achieving an acceptable outcome on
                            compensation. The company expressed the hope that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> could be induced to invoke the 90-day
                            extension provision in the copper amendment to lengthen the timetable
                            beyond its currently established October deadline, to provide time for
                            moderating influences to take effect. The other US companies concerned
                            oppose such extension.</p>
                        <p>The question for the U.S. at this stage is whether it wishes, however
                            slim the chances of success, to take a further initiative to attempt to
                            induce acceptable compensation in time to affect the final <gloss

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> has had some short term success
                            in seeking four basic economic objectives: Containment of inflation
                            through price controls; reduced unemployment; increased production
                            supported by rising <pb n="422" facs="0462" xml:id="pg_422"/>popular
                            consumption; and a more equitable income distribution. Production
                            increases were achieved only by using idle capacity, however, and the
                            rate of increase is now sinking for lack of new investment. To meet
                            demand the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> has had to increase
                            imports, especially of food. While substantial foreign exchange reserves
                            were still available early in 1971 for this purpose, they have declined
                            sharply in recent months due primarily to large shortfalls in copper
                            earnings. By the end of this year reserves are expected to fall to
                            around $110 million, roughly one month’s import level. The balance of
                            payments outlook for 1972 indicates some degree of further
                            deterioration, although it cannot be precisely quantified. The principal
                            problems of 1971, dissappointing copper output and capital inflows, and
                            high imports, cannot be substantially improved under foreseen
                            conditions.</p>

                            private creditors. The debt service for 1972 of $251 million is 26% of
                            projected total exports, or 6% over the traditional 20% “danger point.”
                            $85 million of the $251 million is pay-able to U.S. creditors ($72

                        <p>The foreign exchange problem is compounded by a shortage of short-term
                            credits. U.S. banks alone report that their short-term credits to Chile
                            fell from $199 million to $158 million in the first five months of 1971.
                            The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> has been unwilling to accept

                            new large inputs of foreign exchange by early 1972, it will be forced to

                        <p>The radical elements of the Chilean Socialist Party favor and are
                            pressing for a confrontation with the U.S. earlier rather than later, in
                            the belief that radicalization is essential to the establishment of
                            socialism in the country. In addition to the political attraction, there
                            is in the prospect of confrontation the more immediate economic
                            temptation to the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> of the benefit it
                            would derive from a repudiation of debt to the U.S. Government and
                            private U.S. creditors. As noted above, this would wipe out about $1
                            billion of indebtedness and an average of some $77 million in annual
                            debt service to the US over the next four years. The adverse effect of
                            debt repudiation on the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>’s
                            credit-worthiness would be conclusive, the internal shock would be

                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would probably take the step
                            only if he felt he could successfully blame it on U.S. coercion.</p>
                        <p>The preference of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, the
                            Communists and other less radical forces for avoiding a confrontation is
                            based on the tactical consideration that for a time Chile can squeeze
                            sufficient benefits from normal relations with the West to make it
                            worthwhile to retain them, while not compromising on ultimate objectives
                            which are adverse to U.S. interests. Thus, while the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> seeks to minimize the relationship
                            between copper compensation and its general credit standing, the
                            principal constraint on the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> remains
                            its desire to keep its creditworthiness (and respectability and
                            influence) in the West.</p>
                        <p>A confrontation with Chile over treatment of U.S. investment would give
                            to Chile the political benefit of championing a popular cause in Latin
                            America and elsewhere in the underdeveloped world, with corresponding
                            disadvantage to us. It would heighten the chances of the confiscation
                            without compensation of all already expropriated and remaining U.S.
                            investment in Chile, and encourage some moves against U.S. investment
                            elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>To the extent that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> established
                            the belief that it was the victim of U.S. coercion, it would rally
                            support to itself, and could shift to the U.S. the blame for its own
                            economic and other failures.</p>
                        <p>A confrontation would also over time have the effect of impelling Chile’s
                            drift out of the hemisphere and toward reliance for survival on the
                            Soviet Union. Such a development would have both positive and negative
                            aspects for us. On the one hand it would increase the demands on Soviet
                            resources and limit the attractiveness of Chile as a model for Latin
                            American and other developing nations. On the other hand, confrontation
                            would virtually eliminate what connections and capacities for influence
                            in Chile that we now have, and would stimulate an increase in Soviet
                            presence and influence in South America.</p>
                        <p>A satisfactory outcome on compensation to expropriated companies would
                            reduce the likelihood or imminence of a confrontation over investment.
                            Such a settlement is likely to be unattainable, whether or not we make a
                            positive effort to encourage it, and the U.S. response to an
                            unsatisfactory outcome will have to be decided when the time comes in
                            the light of our overall interests.</p>
                        <p>Even if unsuccessful with respect to the compensation outcome, however,
                            our having made the effort could in itself improve our position against
                            charges of coercion by showing a positive, forthcoming attitude, and
                            might have a general moderating effect on <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> policy on other issues of importance to the U.S. On the

                            satisfaction of copper interests. There is also danger that it could be
                            taken by the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> as a sign <pb n="425"

                        <p>The making of a positive effort to induce a satisfactory compensation
                            outcome would raise problems in another direction. Apart from the scant

                        <p>Political and economic pressures are being exerted by the Chilean
                            government on <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi>, the largest
                            independent newspaper in Chile which is considered an important bulwark
                            against the regime of President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Salvador
                                Allende</persName>. This situation may be viewed in the larger
                            context of a hardening of attitude by President <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and his supporters toward the
                            internal opposition and the increasing possibility of an open economic
                            and political confrontation between Chile and the U.S. Government. The
                            U.S. Ambassador and the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> Station are
                            recommending covert financial support of one million dollars to <hi
                                rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> to keep it in operation and maintain
                            the independence of the major non-Marxist newspaper in Chile. There are
                            indications that this amount, even if it could be securely inserted into
                            the newspaper, may not assure the survival of <hi rend="italic">El
                                Mercurio</hi> if the Chilean Government is sufficiently determined
                            to silence the opposition.</p>

                        <p>A number of recent developments show the probable intention of the
                            Chilean Government to force the closure of the Edwards’ chain of
                            newspapers in Chile comprised of <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi>
                            (120,000 daily; 300,000 Sunday), <hi rend="italic">La Segunda</hi> and
                                <hi rend="italic">Ultimas Noticias</hi>. <hi rend="italic">El

                            position in Chile as does the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> in
                            the U.S. press. The other two newspapers are tabloids with a combined
                            circulation slightly larger than <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi>.
                            There are also sister editions of <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> in
                            Antofagasta and Valparaiso. The only other major non-Marxist newspapers
                            in Chile either eulogize <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>

                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> made it clear he would
                            retaliate against <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> for its leading
                            role in opposing him during the presidential campaign. The steps now
                            being taken by the Chilean Government to put the economic squeeze on <hi
                                rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> have been made possible by the
                            increasing governmental control of finance and business which virtually
                            assures the government that no centers of financial independence can
                            exist today in Chile.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] <hi rend="italic">El
                                Mercurio</hi> would need a minimum of $1 million to survive for the
                            next year or two. Without such financial support it would be forced to
                            close before the end of September. Although this closure would be for
                            economic reasons there is no doubt that these financial problems have
                            been politically inspired and represent a deliberate effort by the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government to
                            silence the major independent newspaper in Chile.</p>
                        <p>Pressures by the government on <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> are
                            exercised directly on the newspaper and on the other business holdings
                            of <persName corresp="#p_EEA_1">Agustin Edwards</persName>. [<hi
                                rend="italic">10½ lines not declassified</hi>] Lastly, in a major
                            speech on 4 September, President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> attacked <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> for
                            its anti-government editorials and said its owner should be in jail
                            rather than out of the country. Other types of pressure which the
                            government can be expected to use if the above actions do not have the
                            desired effect include denial of loans from any other Chilean banks, now
                            possible because of the government’s recent steps to control all major
                            Chilean banking institutions. Also anticipated is termination of the
                            traditional three months’ credit extended by <hi rend="italic">El
                                Mercurio’s</hi> paper and ink suppliers, with government acquisition
                            of the firm controlling the major source of the country’s newsprint
                            expected shortly in any case.</p>
                        <p>The determination of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to
                            control the internal opposition in Chile can be seen in the increasing
                            stridency of the government press against those who differ with the
                            government, and his sustained search for a formula to change the present
                            legislature to a unicameral system, his unstated intention being to
                            eliminate the opposition’s slight majority in both houses of congress.
                            Internationally, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has
                            tidied up relations with Argentina and just completed a trip to the west
                            coast Andean countries of Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, during which his
                            public and private statements clearly identified the U.S. Government as
                            the main source of opposition to the economic success of his own
                            government and, indeed, all of Latin America. The deterioration of
                            recent negotiations with U.S. firms about the terms under which they are
                            to be nationalized has probably been a determinant factor in this
                            hardening attitude of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            after his initial public statements during the early months of his
                            government which attempted to portray his attitude toward the U.S. as
                            both positive and basically friendly.</p>

                        <p>The ability of <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> to withstand long-term
                            pressures from the Chilean Government is not good. As an example of
                            changes which <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> has undergone just to
                            survive this long, it lost 60% of its pre-<persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> advertising revenue because of depressed
                            economic conditions and lack of business confidence in Chile today. It
                            has begun to convert to a circulation-based system rather than the
                            earlier financing of the newspaper through advertising. It still faces
                            the problem of cutting overhead, particularly a 40% cut in personnel in
                            a situation where labor peace is obtained only through strict compliance

                        <p>—Discontent with the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            Government has become more vocal in recent weeks.</p>
                        <p>—There is no evidence that discontent is being translated into potential
                            for armed resistance either within the military or outside it.</p>
                        <p>—President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is aware of
                            the extent of discontent and retains the capability of keeping it within
                            manageable bounds. All signs suggest that he will remain in full control
                            for the foreseeable future.</p>
                        <p>—The military is unlikely to unite against <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> unless he commits a blatantly unconstitutional
                            act, tries to suppress the opposition by force, or makes a move that the
                            military considers a threat against the armed forces as an
                            institution.</p>

                                government has become more vocal in recent weeks. There is no
                                evidence, however, that this discontent is <pb n="433" facs="0473"
                                    xml:id="pg_433"/>being translated into any significant
                                organizing for armed resistance, either within the military or among
                                disgruntled civilian groups. Neither is there any indication that
                                discontent is so serious as to permit enemies of the regime to
                                provoke outbreaks of violence, except on a small scale and in
                                isolated instances. President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> is aware of the extent of discontent and,
                                consummate politician that he is, retains the capability of keeping
                                it within manageable bounds. All signs suggest that he will remain
                                in control for the foreseeable future.</p>
                            <p>1. The increasingly vocal discontent in Chile is in part the natural
                                welling of criticism that has faced all recent Chilean presidents as
                                they near the end of their first year in office. In <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s case, it is aggravated
                                by growing economic difficulties, by the social and economic
                                dislocations brought on by his programs, and by a residual fear of
                                Communism among a minority of Chileans. Chileans are jealous of
                                their traditional right to speak up and criticize the authorities.
                                Since the opposition press, radio, and TV have been enfeebled under
                                    <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, much of the
                                criticism is of necessity by word of mouth.</p>
                            <p>2. There is no evidence that present discontent is being translated
                                into organized plotting against the government. Observers of the
                                Chilean scene have long noted the Chilean propensity to substitute
                                virulent vocal criticism for action. Discontent may well become even
                                more stridently expressed in coming months, but present indications
                                are that it is unlikely to be translated into concerted action
                                against the regime.</p>
                            <p>3. Chilean landowners and their allies in the business and industrial
                                communities as well as certain Chilean military officers have
                                figured in recent reporting on alleged antiregime plotting. The
                                first category—men who have lost or stand to lose the most as
                                    <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> implements his
                                programs—are still able to engage in some activities through such
                                organizations as the <hi rend="italic">Sociedad de Fomento
                                    Fabril</hi>, which is currently engaged in a rear-guard effort
                                to defend the interests of the private business community. [<hi
                                    rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] a leader of the
                                society, recently asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                    >Korry</persName> for assistance in getting his family to the
                                United States in case his position in Chile “becomes untenable”—a
                                sign that the organization may be losing faith in its continued
                                viability under <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>.
                                Some elements of the political right last year organized a group
                                called <hi rend="italic">Patria y Libertad</hi> to resist the
                                regime. According to unconfirmed reports, <hi rend="italic">Patria y
                                    Libertad</hi> cells are being armed with smuggled weapons. At
                                present, very little solid information is available on this
                                organization.</p>
                            <p>4. Chilean landowners probably have weapons in some quantity. Many of
                                them stockpiled arms in 1964 when they feared <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> might win that year’s
                                election. They did not engage in concerted resistance, however,
                                during the wave of illegal land seizures early this year. Their
                                numbers and dominion have now been whittled away and, whatever <pb
                                    n="434" facs="0474" xml:id="pg_434"/>the degree of their anger,
                                they probably feel that the time to act has passed.</p>
                            <p>5. Some representatives of the Chilean private sector are apparently
                                in contact with like-minded men in neighboring Latin American
                                countries, as well as with Chilean colleagues who moved to Argentina
                                after <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s election.
                                There is no hard evidence, however, that the Chilean stay-at-homes
                                have secured significant assistance from these sources in the form
                                of money or weapons. Some could be forthcoming, and it is possible
                                to smuggle small quantities of weapons into Chile from Argentina and
                                Bolivia. In the continuing absence of any sizable group within Chile
                                willing and able to use these weapons against the regime, such
                                smuggling would appear to have no immediate importance.</p>
                            <p>6. Many beleaguered landowners and businessmen probably hope somehow
                                to enlist the Chilean military in an effort to “put things right” in
                                Chile. They do have some contacts among retired or active military
                                officers, but there is no evidence that they have made significant
                                progress in any effort to put things right.</p>
                            <p>7. High Chilean military commanders have reiterated in the past year
                                that they will not permit <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> to transgress the constitution. These
                                statements may in part be motivated by an abiding suspicion of
                                Communism held by a number of military officers, and their awareness
                                that the Communist Party has a key role in the administration. At
                                the same time, however, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> is the constitutionally elected president
                                and military leaders often restate their commitment to defend him.
                                Chile’s armed forces remain among the least inclined in Latin
                                America to intervene in politics. Many military officers, moreover,
                                are convinced that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                                programs contain many positive and long-overdue reforms. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, for his part, has
                                cultivated the military more assiduously and skillfully than any of
                                his recent predecessors.</p>
                            <p>8. The recent increase in vocal discontent in Chile has nonetheless
                                had some effect in the military. Chilean military officers, too,
                                have a propensity for grumbling. There is no evidence, however, that
                                opposition to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, even
                                on the vocal level, is widespread or cohesive in the armed forces or
                                among members of the well-disciplined <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Carabineros</hi> (national police). There is no information on
                                any conspiracies.</p>
                            <p>9. Specific reporting on military unrest in recent weeks suggests
                                that it is scattered—as are most military units. None of the
                                officers mentioned in these reports commands units of strength or
                                strategic location. If an uprising were to be attempted by some
                                provincial military unit in the hope of setting off a chain
                                reaction, it could easily be isolated. A rebellion would have to
                                turn quickly to Santiago if it were to be successful, and it would
                                require at least passive support from the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Carabineros</hi>.</p>
                            <pb n="435" facs="0475" xml:id="pg_435"/>
                            <p>10. Since it came to power over ten months ago, the government has
                                steadily increased its capabilities for monitoring the development
                                of conspiracies within the military. The small group of officers
                                linked to imprisoned General <persName corresp="#p_VMR_1"
                                    >Viaux</persName>, the <hi rend="italic">Comite
                                    Revolucionario</hi>, was probably thoroughly penetrated. Members
                                of this group never got beyond the talking stage, have not been
                                heard from in recent months, and may have disbanded. Four retired
                                generals are currently reported to be under surveillance because of
                                their involvement in antigovernment activity. A clandestine source
                                reports, however, that the generals have not yet been detained
                                because their activities are not considered a threat to the
                                government.</p>
                            <p>11. As for the near future, nothing has happened to change our
                                judgment of last month (in <gloss target="#t_SNIE_1">SNIE</gloss>
                                94–71) that the military is unlikely to unite against <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> unless he commits a
                                blatantly unconstitutional act, tries to suppress the opposition by
                                force, or makes a move that the military considers a threat against
                                the armed forces as an institution. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> recognizes this and will avoid such actions.
                                In the longer term, however, a deterioration of the Chilean economy
                                which brought on severe social unrest could prompt military
                                intervention. Chile is presently a long way from that degree of
                                unrest.</p>
                            <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is aware of the
                                present discontent with his government. He may be concerned, but he
                                has given no sign that he feels obliged in any way to modify his
                                programs. He has known from the beginning that he must operate
                                within the constraints of the political facts of life in Chile.
                                Moreover, he does not need to go beyond the present constitution to
                                consolidate further his political power and bring about many of the
                                social, economic, and political changes he has in mind for Chile.
                                When he judges the time to be right he will probably be able to
                                change the constitution legally, or at least in ways that will not
                                antagonize the military.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> Sept 27 (Part I of
                            II). Ref: (A) Santiago 4975; (B) Santiago 5020.</p>
                        <p>1. My talk with <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            (summarized in Santiago 4987), the day before he surprised us only by
                            assuming full personal responsibility for wiping out the big two copper
                            companies’ claims to any compensation, is sent today in part for the
                            historian and in part for those who must still deal with this great
                            dissembler. Part I is an account promptly recorded by an EmbOff upon my
                            return from the one-hour session that was also attended by <gloss
                                target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AMC_1">Almeyda</persName>; Part II is analytical
                            comment, illuminated by subsequent as well as preceding events.</p>
                        <p>2. Ambassador began encounter by apologizing for the mixup that had led
                            to the cancellation of Sept 23 “man-to-man” meeting <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> had requested. The President
                            waved the matter aside, saying that it did not have any importance and
                            that it had not changed anything.</p>
                        <p>3. The Ambassador stated he welcomed the opportunity because he wished to
                            be certain that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> had
                            understood what Ambassador had, on his personal initiative (Ref B), been
                            discussing with <persName corresp="#p_AMC_1">Almeyda</persName>, Arrate
                            and others as a possible exit from what seemed to be an unfortunate
                            impasse. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> replied that he
                            understood perfectly what the Amb had been proposing and that it had
                            been good, “indeed, very good.” He then reviewed the legislation and
                            lamented that it left him no option, not even that of time. The law was
                            passed unanimously by Congress (a point he repeated several times in the
                            meeting) and it left him with very little leeway in its terms. The
                            Comptroller had the task of fixing the basis of compensation and of
                            making certain deductions therefrom. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> could not interfere with that process. He
                            mentioned the arrest 48 hours earlier of <gloss target="#t_ITT_1"
                                >ITT</gloss> Telco head Holmes (Chilean citizen) as a comparable
                            case in which he as President could not interfere because of the
                            separation of powers. He had to make his deductions for excess profits
                            by Sept 29 and there was no other way.</p>
                        <pb n="437" facs="0477" xml:id="pg_437"/>
                        <p>4. Amb replied that it was his firm recollection that the majority of the
                            Chilean Congress had expressly wanted to avoid conflicts with the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and had therefore left the copper bill
                            deliberately vague in key parts, so that the President would have the
                            flexibility to pay “fair and just” compensation in keeping with Chilean
                            tradition. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_AMC_1">Almeyda</persName> replied that, of course, the
                            majority of Chileans wanted to avoid conflicts, just as they themselves
                            did. Unfortunately, however, the law did restrict their freedom in
                            trying to work something out. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> then reviewed his supposed handling of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>I case the past weekend in which
                            the expected compromise with the news agency was worked out as
                            up-to-date proof of his desire to have good relations with the US.</p>
                        <p>5. Amb asked if the process for fixing compensation were, as they
                            described it, with <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and
                            the Comptroller independently fixing separate deductions to be levied
                            against the compensation, would there not be a likely result of negative
                            compensation. He mentioned that the total deductions asserted before the
                            Contraloria by Codelco, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                            >Allende</persName>’s “own agency,” exceeded one billion dollars, more
                            than three times the share of the net worth corresponding to the US
                            investors. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_AMC_1">Almeyda</persName> at first challenged that
                            figure without at the same time assigning it much importance. In
                            response to Amb’s query as to whether they wanted to have an <gloss
                                target="#t_IPC_1">IPC</gloss> case on their hands, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> replied that “if I do my
                            calculations correctly, that problem will not arise.”</p>
                        <p>6. Amb noted that possibility of negative compensation raised problem of
                            what would happen to <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>-guaranteed
                            notes already given for 51 per cent interest in three of the Anaconda
                            and Kennecott companies. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            said that the law’s elimination of Teniente’s revaluation of assets made
                            it impossible for the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> to pay for
                            the 51 per cent in the amount and on the terms previously contemplated.
                            (He obviously regarded the notes held by Kennecott-Braden and insured by
                                <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss> as having been given in
                            payment for the initial 51 per cent.) The Kennecott problem was the most
                            difficult, and of course the same criteria on excess profits applied
                            against Kennecott would also have to be applied against Anaconda. If he
                            chose 5 or 8 or 10 or 12 as a just norm for one, it would have to be
                            applied against the other. Anaconda deserved better treatment than
                            Kennecott, he said, since it had not juggled its asset value.</p>
                        <p>7. Amb said that failure of the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> to
                            honor the notes for the 51 per cent interests bought in 1967 and 1969
                            according to their original tenor could have a most serious effect on
                            US–Chile relations as well as on Chile’s standing in the international
                            financial community. He recalled that notes given Anaconda had been
                            discounted and were now held by private banks throughout the world. The
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> had best make no mistake about
                            the consequences of such action or of triggering <gloss
                                target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss>
                            <pb n="438" facs="0478" xml:id="pg_438"/>payments. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> noted that Kennecott did not
                            have such transferable notes.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> asked if there was
                            some way in which Chile could avoid the risks that the Amb had said were
                            inherent in the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>’s policy towards
                            the US investors. Amb replied that as a pragmatic country the US always
                            sought, as the Secretary’s letter to <persName corresp="#p_AMC_1"
                                >Almeyda</persName> in mid-August had made clear, pragmatic
                            solutions to such problems. The Amb had, in the last weeks, been trying
                            his best to search for such a pragmatic solution. He was ready to listen
                            attentively to any counter-suggestion. He summarized once more the
                            approach which he had, on his personal initiative, been proposing.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> replied again that
                            in the case of Kennecott, such a solution would be especially difficult.
                            Although at first it appeared <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> was referring to compensation for the 49
                            percent, an exchange of questions and answers clarified that he was
                            speaking of the possibility of only some Braden notes being honored when
                            due and that he was already assuming that nothing would be paid for the
                            49 percent.</p>
                        <p>9. Although earlier in the discussion <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> had said that he had no idea how the Comptroller
                            would decide with respect to the various Codelco objections, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> now volunteered that Exotica
                            and Andina would get special treatment and that he had spoken to the
                            Comptroller at some length to impress on him the importance of
                            preserving the substance of the Cerro accord, “even though Codelco’s
                            figures are different from the company’s.” He qualified his statement on
                            Exotica by stating, “merely as a hypothetical example” that if the
                            Exotica operation really was a misadventure, as it appeared, then he
                            might be required not to assume payment of the Banco Commercial Italiano
                            loan on the grounds that the proceeds had not been usefully invested. He
                            said that the same course of action might be indicated—again as a
                            hypothetical example—in the case of El Teniente debts, as a result of
                            difficulties with tunnel 8. In each case he said, the banks had not
                            specified nor confirmed the use of the loan monies as had the Exim.</p>
                        <p>10. The Amb said he recognized that the law provided the President with
                            varied weapons to knock down the value due the departing companies. The
                            critical question was one of will—did the President and did the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> wish to impose unilaterally a
                            judgement that would make it very difficult if not impossible for the US
                            to accept? Did <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> prefer to
                            seek to humiliate the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                            administration or not? From the Amb’s inexpert view, it seemed that as a
                            head of a respected country and as a successful statesman <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> could offer an entirely unique
                            contribution to history, the revolutionary socialist who not only was
                            committed publicly to preserving democratic forms but one who could
                            arrive at a pragmatic arrangement with the US on difficult issues
                            without sacrificing principles. Indeed it would be more painful in some
                                <pb n="439" facs="0479" xml:id="pg_439"/>ways to convince some US
                            quarters to accept the Amb’s proposition than it would be for <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to convince his constituents.
                            The crucial question was, the Amb stressed, one of will. It would be an
                            absurdity for a few million dollars a year, as would be the case under
                            the formula the Amb was suggesting, to be the cause of a far greater gap
                            and one that would feed destructively on itself. If <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would not permit the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to preserve either dignity or pride in
                            the protection of its citizenry or entities, if he were to insist on
                            unilateral imposition of a totally unacceptable retroactive judgment, he
                            would be betting on a revolution in US norms that was not going to occur
                            next year. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> said he was
                            not counting on such a revolution.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> then asked the
                            Ambassador to say “how much would it cost to settle” and referred to his
                            “man-to-man” invitation. The Amb said he had outlined in as specific a
                            manner as he could in his talks with <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s confidants the dimensions of a settlement he
                            thought could be accepted by all sides. Did the President have any
                            alternative in mind? Was there something he required from the US? Or
                            from the companies? The Amb wished the President to understand that an
                            amicable arrangement would doubtless ease Chile’s credit problems in
                            ways that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> could calculate for
                            itself. It was important to settle all the problems now including <gloss
                                target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> which might provide a model.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> said <gloss
                                target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> was a separate matter and briefly
                            repeated the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>’s rationale for
                            management and physical appraisal by an independent group. In the same
                            calm, cordial fashion he had maintained throughout the interview, he
                            concluded it by stating that the Amb’s earlier observation had been
                            correct: that there were political restraints on both sides that made
                            the problem very difficult. He would have Arrate inform the Amb of his
                            decision the next day in advance of his announcement because he felt
                            this was the “correct way” to behave, the “fair way to do business.” As
                            he walked to the portal, he volunteered that he had felt that relations
                            on the personal level with him and with the Foreign Minister had been
                            very good. He appreciated it. In other words, nothing personal, old boy,
                            in this declaration of war.</p>

                            the columnists are all saying it strongly, even, I think, the [<hi

                            properties. He’s thrown down—he’s thrown the gauntlet to us. Now, it’s

                        <p rend="center">Introduction</p>
                        <p>1. Chile’s announcement on 11 October that Anaconda and Kennecott would
                            receive no compensation confirmed the worst fears of US companies and
                            government officials alike but came as no real surprise. Payment of
                            adequate and timely compensation—a sine qua non of US policy if
                            intergovernmental friction is to be avoided—never had ap<pb n="443"
                                facs="0483" xml:id="pg_443"/>peared likely, and prospects for a
                            satisfactory settlement had progressively dimmed over recent months. By
                            mid-August, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>—a consummate
                            politician on all fronts—was already pointing to new US economic
                            policies to justify any internationally unpopular decisions that Chile
                            might “also be forced to take to defend its economy.”</p>
                        <p>2. After less than one year in office, the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> government can justifiably claim substantial
                            progress in effecting its socialist revolution. The President has proved
                            himself remarkably adept at keeping his seemingly unwieldy coalition
                            together and his opposition divided. Despite its minority representation
                            in the Congress, this political dexterity and full use of traditionally
                            strong executive powers have permitted the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> administration to assume pervasive economic
                            control with only an occasional bending of constitutional law. Its
                            policies, however, have seriously aggravated some chronic economic
                            problems and created others that will have to be dealt with in the
                            months to come. This memorandum chronicles economic developments in
                            recent months and describes the status of key domestic indicators and
                            foreign economic relations as of early October. It also comments on the
                            factors leading to Chile’s adoption of a hard line on the copper
                            question.</p>

                            Decision</p>
                        <p>3. President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>—clearly the
                            indispensable man in today’s Chile—thus far has managed to stay on top
                            of the rapid and radical changes that are transforming his country into
                            a socialist state. Developments of the past few months, however, reflect
                            a mixed bag of successes and failures, progress and problems. By the end
                            of September, the two most important elements affecting <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s thinking were:</p>
                        <p>• A perhaps exaggerated view of Chile’s importance in the world and its
                            international “respectability” resulting, among other things, from the
                            meeting with Argentine President <persName corresp="#p_LAA_1"
                                >Lanusse</persName>, the successful tour of Peru, Colombia, and
                            Ecuador, Chile’s vocal participation in various international forums
                            protesting the new US economic policy, and the presence of numerous
                            visiting foreign delegations in Santiago.</p>
                        <p>• Growing worry about worsening economic problems and his ability to
                            consolidate political power in time to deal with them.</p>
                        <p>Both elements bear heavily on <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s policy decisions affecting the pace of
                            “irreversible change” in Chile’s domestic society and the
                            administration’s stance—confrontation or cooperation—vis-à-vis the
                            United States regarding copper compensation and other financial
                            obligations.</p>
                        <p>4. Food and other consumer good shortages are perhaps the most
                            embarrassing indication that a shift away from the populist policies of
                            the regime’s first eleven months is now overdue. Somewhat less polit<pb
                                n="444" facs="0484" xml:id="pg_444"/>ically damaging but equally
                            important signs are the decline in investment, production problems in
                            copper and other industries, and the continuing drop in foreign
                            reserves. Although <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            speeches contain increasingly frequent allusions to “the hard times to
                            come,” his regime apparently does not yet feel ready to take the harsh
                            actions required to bring supply and demand into equilibrium or to
                            impose upon the populace the sacrifices inherent in a shift from “the
                            year of consumption” to “the year of accumulation” (i.e., forced
                            investment in basic industries).</p>
                        <p>5. The need to effect such a shift was a key factor in deciding which way
                            Chile would go on the question of compensation for large expropriated
                            properties. For months, the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> regime had been weighing the relative gains and
                            losses to be derived from taking a hard or a soft line with the US
                            companies involved. As the mid-October deadline on copper decisions
                            approached, both <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and the
                            Communist Party were visibly moving toward the more radical Socialist
                            Party line of negligible or no compensation. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s final hard-line decision
                            almost certainly was heavily influenced by his increasing conviction
                            that, by so doing, more would be gained in terms of Chilean popular
                            commitment to the socialist revolution than would be lost from damage to
                            Chile’s international credit rating.</p>
                        <p>6. Chile had completed nationalization of the formerly US-owned copper
                            industries on 16 July when the “copper amendment” to the constitution
                            took effect and President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> signed five decrees giving the Chilean State
                            Copper Corporation (<gloss target="#t_CODELCO_1">CODELCO</gloss>)
                            possession of Kennecott’s El Teniente, Cerro’s Andina, and Anaconda’s
                            Chuquicamata, El Salvador, and Exotica operations. The amendment, passed
                            unanimously by the Chilean Congress some months earlier, permitted
                            nationalization with little or no compensation but provided the
                            administration latitude for negotiating an acceptable settlement with
                            the companies. The Comptroller General was given 90 days in which to
                            determine the book value of the expropriated firms—the basis for
                            compensation stipulated in the constitutional amendment. At the same
                            time, <gloss target="#t_CODELCO_1">CODELCO</gloss> was directed to
                            “inventory” the installations to determine the amount to be deducted
                            from book value because of deterioration in physical plant and
                            mismanagement of the mining properties. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> in effect had the
                            responsibility for determining the final amount of compensation to be
                            paid, having been given the right to deduct “excess profits” from the
                            modified book value figures.</p>
                        <p>7. President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            announcement on 28 September that $774 million in excess profits would
                            be deducted from compensation paid to Anaconda and Kennecott left little
                            doubt that Chile had opted to risk a showdown with the US government.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s excess profits
                            figure far exceeded the likely book value estimate of the companies’
                            current <pb n="445" facs="0485" xml:id="pg_445"/>holdings being compiled
                            by the Comptroller General’s office. At the same time, <gloss
                                target="#t_CODELCO_1">CODELCO</gloss>—using methodology with no
                            pretense of being anything but vindictive—filed a $1 billion claim
                            against the companies for “deficient” equipment and “damage to the
                            mines.” Under these circumstances, the amount of “negative compensation”
                            Chile would offer also canceled out existing claims by Kennecott and
                            Anaconda for the earlier sale of 51% equity in their properties. In
                            fact, the final announcement issued by the Comptroller General on 11
                            October claims the US companies owe some $388 million that the Chilean
                            government has no means to collect.</p>
                        <p>8. Chile’s claim of “negative compensation” may be used to justify
                            reneging at least in part on <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s earlier promises to honor some $350–$400
                            million in debts to Eximbank and other third-party creditors incurred by
                            the companies in carrying out their recent expansion programs. In an
                            attempt to retain some respectability in international financial
                            circles, however, Chile is likely to pursue a more generous policy
                            regarding the repayment of the $100 million or so owed to Japanese and
                            European financiers than it adopts toward Eximbank. For similar reasons,
                            it has promised to pay for Cerro Corporation’s equity in Andina—a newly
                            developed mine that has not yet earned the company any profit. The
                            amount involved, moreover, is a small enough price to pay for continued
                            access to US equipment and technology, as assured in Cerro’s agreement
                            in late August to act as the Chilean government’s purchasing agent for
                            material needed to operate the expropriated industry.</p>
                        <p>9. Chile’s failure to offer adequate compensation for expropriated copper
                            properties will give the investment guaranty program operated by the
                            Overseas Private Investment Corporation (<gloss target="#t_OPIC_1"
                                >OPIC</gloss>) its first major test. Under this program, the US
                            copper companies involved could file claims against the US government
                            for as much as $368 million. Moreover, because Chile’s adoption of a
                            hard line on copper does not bode well for ongoing negotiations with
                            International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT) for purchase of its equity
                            in the Chilean Telephone Company (<gloss target="#t_C_1"

                        <p>10. In an early September speech outlining his party’s strategy for
                            carrying out the Chilean “revolution,” Communist Party Chief <persName
                                corresp="#p_CLL_1">Luis Corvalan</persName> justifiably counted as a

                            economic program. The Communist Party has long recognized that <persName

                                <pb n="446" facs="0486" xml:id="pg_446"/>will make his revolution
                            irreversible. <persName corresp="#p_CLL_1">Corvalan</persName> pointed
                            in particular to capitalist leaders’ acquiescence in the division of the
                            economy into three sectors as an accomplishment that substantially eases
                            the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government’s task.
                            This view was probably only strengthened when the Christian Democratic
                            Party (<gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>) agreed in mid-September to
                            vote against Economic Minister Vuscovic’s impeachment in exchange for an
                            open-ended commitment by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            to submit a draft law “soon” that would establish nationalization
                            standards and try to define clearly the public, private, and mixed
                            sectors of the economy. It is doubtful that the government itself has
                            any detailed timetable for nationalization of various firms and
                            activities still in private hands. In any event, the question is rapidly
                            becoming largely academic in that the government already has gained or
                            soon will have direct or indirect control over all key economic areas.
                            Except for two branches of European banks and a couple of minor plants,
                            all of the foreign operations thus far taken over by the state were
                            formerly owned by US interests.</p>

                        <p>11. Increased purchasing power among lower income groups has continued to
                            nurture the mini-boom in manufacturing output, but growth is leveling
                            off as more industries reach full capacity production levels. Industrial
                            production increased by less than 2% in July and about 4% in August,
                            compared with 8.5% in June. Moreover, although overall industrial output
                            during the first eight months of this year averaged about 6%–7% higher
                            than in the same period in 1970, performance among the various
                            manufacturing sectors was very uneven. Consumer goods and various
                            intermediate products showed the most dynamic growth, while construction
                            and investment goods remained depressed. Initiation of a massive
                            government housing program and repair of earthquake damage probably
                            spurred demand for construction materials beginning in August,

                        <p>12. President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and other
                            top government officials appear increasingly concerned about the
                            expected decline in agricultural production in the next year or two.
                            Agriculture Minister <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Jacques
                                Chonchol</persName>, a key leader in agrarian reform under both the

                            administrations, contends that output will be normal and that the sharp
                            rise in agricultural import requirements to some $250–$300 million
                            annually is solely attributable to increased consumption among lower
                            income groups. Other government spokesmen, however, have been more
                            candid about the production problems on both newly expropriated farms
                            and those still in private hands. The US Embassy in Santiago estimates
                            that dislocations and uncertainties deriving from government policies
                            will cause at least a 10% drop in agricultural output. If so, pro<pb

                            than in 1965 and, barring unpopular restraints on consumer demand,
                            agricultural import requirements would be even larger than now
                            planned.</p>
                        <p>13. While hoping to minimize the production costs involved, the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government clearly is willing
                            to pay a substantial price for irreversible, revolutionary change in the
                            countryside. Recent official statements point to an acceleration in the
                            pace of land redistribution, indicating that all large farms will be
                            expropriated by mid-1972. Moreover, various bills now being drafted or
                            already in the Congress could lower the maximum permissible farm size
                            from 80 basic hectares (under the 1967 agrarian reform law) to the 40
                            basic hectares called for in legislation sponsored by the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> or to the 20 basic hectares advocated
                            by the Socialist Party. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> government also has decided to change officially
                            the tenancy procedures called for under the Frei law—in effect, killing
                            the myth that peasants would eventually receive individual titles to
                            expropriated land. A new system of agrarian reform centers—collectivized
                            groupings of expropriated farms to be worked cooperatively by all
                            peasants in the area—will replace the asentamientos (transitional
                            agrarian reform settlements on individual estates). Although few if any
                            settlers actually received land titles under the asentamiento system,
                            the new tenancy arrangements dash any lingering hopes for eventual land
                            ownership the peasants may have had. In an effort to reduce agricultural
                            inefficiency, the structure and operations of the new agrarian reform
                            centers also will give the government more complete control over
                            planning, production, and sales.</p>

                        <p>14. While food and other consumer good shortages have not yet reached
                            crisis proportions, they are a source of ever-increasing political
                            embarrassment to the government. Economic Minister Vuscovic and other
                            officials have publicly attributed the shortages to problems inherited
                            from earlier administrations, to earthquakes and other natural
                            catastrophes, to a US “boycott”, to a domestic “reactionary plot”, and
                            the like, but opposition party allegations that the full blame should be
                            laid on the doorstep of government policy appear to be gaining more
                            credence. Although bad weather and earthquakes in fact did aggravate
                            food supply problems, the sharp reduction in herds following <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s 1970 election and subsequent
                            price and agrarian reform policies are basically to blame for spreading
                            shortages of beef, pork, lamb, poultry, eggs, seafood products, and
                            various dry and canned foods. As supply dependability decreased,
                            hoarding has further complicated the problem. Shortages of consumer
                            durables also are increasing as industries reach full-capacity
                            production and are understandably unwilling to invest in plant
                            expansion. While the inability to fulfill demand for such items as
                            household appliances and television sets will simply be <pb n="448"
                                facs="0488" xml:id="pg_448"/>reflected in longer waiting lists,
                            government officials are more concerned about expected shortages of
                            shoes, clothing, and other necessities in the next few months. As in the
                            case of food, the government probably will try to cover these shortages
                            by increasing imports, as long as foreign reserves permit.</p>

                        <p>15. The government’s ability to hold the rise in the consumer price index
                            (CPI) to 12.7% through August (compared with 29.5% during the first

                            very useful economic indicator. The CPI rarely has been an accurate

                            administrations. Black market activities also are not a new phenomenon,
                            although a wider variety of goods probably now figures in this trade.
                            The important difference from past experience is that the CPI is now
                            even less efficient as a barometer of inflationary pressures than it was
                            before. With more and more production in state hands—and therefore
                            subject to government subsidies—and little official concern for private
                            entrepreneurs’ dwindling profit margins, prices less and less reflect
                            free market demand and supply relationships.</p>
                        <p>16. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government has
                            continued its expansionary policies contrary to Central Bank
                            recommendations some months ago that it curtail deficit spending (now
                            running at an estimated 30% of government expenditures), raise prices
                            charged by nationalized enterprises, allow prices particularly on luxury
                            goods to rise, reassure private investors, and devalue the escudo to
                            stimulate exports and reduce imports. A government intent upon building
                            socialism is not likely to adopt such orthodox tools for dealing with
                            economic realities. Nevertheless, because output cannot continue to rise
                            for very long in the face of negative savings in the public sector and
                            no investment in private industry and because prospects for increasing
                            supplies through imports are increasingly bleak, the adoption of
                            austerity measures in one form or another can only be a matter of
                            time.</p>

                        <p>17. Because of rising imports, lower export earnings, and the drying up
                            of traditional sources of short-term credit, Chile’s net foreign
                            reserves have declined from about $350 million at the end of last year
                            to an estimated $140 million in mid-September. By the end of 1971,
                            reserves could be as low as $100 million—the equivalent of one month’s
                            imports—if the overall balance-of-payments deficit reaches $250 mil<pb
                                n="449" facs="0489" xml:id="pg_449"/>lion, as expected. Because of
                            the inflationary impact of such a move, the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> government thus far has stuck by its pledge not
                            to devalue the escudo used for commodity trade (i.e., the bankers rate).
                            Nevertheless, it has introduced various regulations to slow the inflow
                            of “non-essential” imports and thereby stem the worsening balance of
                            trade. The government also has recently moved to cut losses from tourism
                            and other non-trade transactions by changing the brokers rate from 14 to
                            28 escudos to the dollar, by imposing various foreign exchange taxes,
                            and by tightening quantitative restrictions on tourist allowances. As a
                            result, Chile now has a full-fledged multiple exchange rate system: 12.2
                            escudos to the dollar for exports and approved imports, 28 escudos for
                            foreign tourists, 38 escudos for payments to foreign creditors, and 43
                            escudos for funds for foreign travel by Chileans and for payment of
                            foreign royalty or licensing fees. Speculation concerning additional
                            changes in exchange rates reportedly has driven the black market rate
                            substantially above the 65 escudos to the dollar averaged in recent
                            months.</p>
                        <p>18. Private firms committed to heavy foreign payments have been hard hit
                            by the recent escudo devaluations. The Chilean National Manufacturers’
                            Association (<gloss target="#t_SOFOFA_1">SOFOFA</gloss>) estimated that
                            private firms owe about $300 million in short-term and medium-term debts
                            abroad—largely to US banks and companies. Of this amount, about $50–$70
                            million is due this year, as are large royalty and licensing payments.
                                <gloss target="#t_SOFOFA_1">SOFOFA</gloss> has warned the government
                            that the increased escudo burden of their foreign debts may bankrupt
                            many firms and increase unemployment. In response to these complaints,
                            Economic Minister Vuscovic reportedly advised the firms “not to pay and
                            see what happens.”</p>

                        <p>19. Chile’s total foreign debt is estimated at $2.4 billion, not
                            including commitments to compensate for foreign private properties
                            nationalized by the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            government. Heaviest repayments are scheduled to occur in 1971–73,
                            averaging more than $300 million annually. The United States is by far
                            Chile’s most important creditor, accounting for approximately half of
                            the scheduled capital outflow. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s recent speeches indicate that Chile may be
                            preparing to impose a debt rescheduling on its creditors. In view of the
                            understandable reluctance of US investors to put new money into Chile,
                            the lack of any substantial US<gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>
                            commitments, and Eximbank’s postponement of a decision on the Lan-Chile
                            loan (and, by inference, other loans) until Chile’s expropriation
                            compensation policies are clarified, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> may decide that he has little to lose from
                            simply defaulting on payments to US creditors. He will make every effort
                            to protect his credit rating elsewhere, however, and at worst will
                            formally request refinancing of outstanding obligations to Western

                            expected in 1971 and 1972 materialize, Chile’s ability to pay will be
                            seriously limited and its creditors would have little alternative but to
                            agree to a debt rollover.</p>

                            government has been disappointed in its efforts to obtain loans and
                            investment in Western Europe where most countries appear to be following
                            a “wait-and-see” policy. An exception to this policy may be European
                            response to efforts by <gloss target="#t_CAP_1">CAP</gloss> (Compania de
                            Acero del Pacifico—Chile’s state iron and steel complex) to obtain $100
                            million in foreign financing for its expansion program. In
                            mid-September, <gloss target="#t_CAP_1">CAP</gloss>’s General Manager
                                <persName corresp="#p_LF_1">Flavian Levine</persName> stated that he
                            would soon be going to Europe to make final arrangements for $75 million
                            in credits previously negotiated and to arrange for an additional $25
                            million reportedly available in England. Belgium, Yugoslavia, Spain, and
                            possibly West Germany apparently are expected to participate in the
                            project. Although details are lacking, it is probable that this
                            financing represents suppliers’ credits covering European exports of
                            equipment for the iron and steel project. Both Western Europe and Japan
                            have shown far more interest in this type of financial assistance as a
                            means of increasing their share of the Chilean market than in supplying
                            untied loans and direct investment capital. Japanese interest in the
                            project also reflects its worldwide search for long-term supplies of raw
                            materials. Japan recently signed a seven-year contract with <gloss
                                target="#t_CAP_1">CAP</gloss> to purchase large amounts of Chilean
                            iron ore, in addition to those supplies earlier arranged for with
                            Bethlehem. Mitsubishi, <gloss target="#t_CAP_1">CAP</gloss>’s sales
                            agent in Japan, also is a major supplier of equipment for the expansion

                            to a shift to Communist area equipment and technology, Soviet and East
                            European involvement in the country clearly has been growing. Numerous
                            technical missions have arrived in Chile in recent months to do
                            feasibility studies on a wide variety of projects to be undertaken with
                            Communist assistance. Since Foreign Minister <persName

                            European capitals in May–June, long-term credit agreements involving
                            more than $100 million are known to have been signed, bringing to $164
                            million total Communist commitments to Chile. All of these credits are
                            designed to cover purchases of material and technical expertise from the
                            donor country. To date, no untied financial assistance has been offered.
                            Long-term credits extended and projects thus far agreed upon are shown

                            signed a military agreement, involving an exchange of army attachés and

                            equipment and material. Although a $50 million figure has been quoted,
                            there is still some question about the amounts involved and the types of
                            equipment that will be purchased. In any event, <persName

                            in his campaign to buy the military’s loyalty with promises of

                            dependence on Free World equipment. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> also may succeed in winning Lan-Chile’s
                            concurrence in purchasing Soviet Ilyushins as the only viable
                            alternative to the Boeing 707s and 727s that Eximbank thus far has
                            refused to finance. The Soviet aircraft industry reportedly has offered
                            to sell Chile on any terms as many civilian jets as it wants. Although
                            opposition by Lan-Chile technicians to buying Ilyushins because of their

                            of a Chilean mission to Moscow in early September, a Lan-Chile team is

                        <p rend="center">CHILE: COPPER AND DOMESTIC POLITICS</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is searching
                            for a mechanism to consolidate the political position of his Popular
                            Unity coalition. He realizes, as do the major elements of the coalition,
                            that time may not be on his side and that economic problems and
                            increasing political opposition will lead to some erosion in his present
                            level of popularity. To counter this trend, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> appears to be maneuvering to gain domestic
                            political advantage from the US Government’s response to the
                            nationalization of the copper companies, which is politically very
                            popular in Chile. Thus, he is posturing himself as a national hero
                            should he avoid an open confrontation with the United States or a
                            national martyr should the United States react harshly, as he more
                            likely expects.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Popular Unity’s Economic Vulnerability</hi>. During
                            his first eleven months in office, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> has sought to consolidate political support for
                            his government programs by accelerated agrarian reform, nationali<pb

                            industry, and expansion of the real buying power of lower classes by
                            wage increases and price controls. However, despite considerable
                            progress in these areas, popular support for his coalition appears to
                            have leveled off at about half of the electorate. A continuing reduction
                            in Chile’s foreign exchange reserves and in its ability to maintain
                            present levels of private consumption by high levels of agricultural and
                            consumer imports will make some belt-tightening inevitable.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">The Opposition Stirs</hi>. The widely held Chilean
                            political belief that a President should be allowed to carry out his
                            basic program, and the ideological hostility between the two major
                            opposition parties, the Christian Democrats and the Nationalists, have
                            prevented them from mounting effective opposition to the Popular Unity’s
                            programs. Nevertheless, in recent weeks the Christian Democrats have
                            increased their opposition. Ex-President Frei has broken his long
                            silence to condemn “a sustained campaign of lies and insults” and the
                            attempt of the Communist Party to impose its rule. Almost
                            simultaneously, the Christian Democratic National Council has attacked
                            the government’s intimidation of the press and the economic asphyxiation
                            of the opposition media, and is now attempting to erode <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s pretensions of working
                            within the system. It has generally supported <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s copper nationalization
                            program but has reserved the right to review the government’s conduct on
                            the issue at a later date.</p>
                        <p>While the Armed Forces remain on the sideline, reluctant to adopt a
                            political posture, there is some evidence of military resentment not
                            only over the quasi-legal tactics frequently employed but also over
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s attempt to create
                            the impression that the military favors his policies.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Is Popular Unity Ready for a Test of Strength</hi>?
                            Popular Unity remains a highly ideological coalition of competing
                            forces. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s personal
                            popularity and acumen are essential to its viability. Issues of timing,
                            patronage, and relative authority between the Socialist and Communist
                            Parties continue to cause strains, and increasingly there is concern
                            within the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> coalition that such
                            weaknesses be offset by some form of political reinforcement before
                            economic weakness limits the coalition’s ability to maneuver vis-à-vis
                            the opposition. There is special concern that Popular Unity will lose
                            political momentum should it wait until the 1973 congressional elections
                            rather than take the initiative now. So far, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has resisted urgings to take
                            an earlier political initiative. However, it appears that he is alert to
                            the need for an attempt earlier rather than later, and can be expected
                            to take advantage of any upswelling in his personal popularity to do
                            so.</p>

                            beginning, the Popular Unity program has included a proposal for
                            constitutional reform which <pb n="454" facs="0494" xml:id="pg_454"
                            />would create a single-chamber “Popular Assembly”. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> also is giving some
                            consideration to requesting an amendment giving him authority to
                            dissolve Congress and convoke new elections. In the event either
                            amendment were submitted to Congress, and rejected, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> could then exploit this by
                            “going to the people” with a plebiscite-type early election.
                            Undoubtedly, such a plebiscite would be a test not only of the
                            constitutional issues but of the entire <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> program. Hence the stakes would be high.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">The Domestic Implications of Copper</hi>. The US
                            response on copper compensation will be an important factor for
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> in his strategy to
                            strengthen his political hold in Chile. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> may still prefer to avoid a confrontation with
                            the US over compensation. Following his determination of “excess
                            profits” earned by the copper companies since 1955, he has attempted to
                            soften somewhat the apparent harshness of the decision by implying that
                            there may still be some room for accommodation between the US and Chile.
                            If there were such accommodation, he might be able to use to electoral
                            advantage his demonstrated ability to deal with the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> on crucial issues. However, in the
                            absence of “economic aggression” by the US he would be risking an
                            election in which strictly domestic issues would be uppermost (and on
                            which he and the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> might be
                            vulnerable). Thus, if the US takes a harsh stand, which <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> now likely expects, he can
                            then exploit the issue to rally all Chileans behind his government,
                            coalition, and program.</p>

                        <p>This memorandum proposes that continuing financial support be provided to
                            the three political parties opposed to the Popular Unity (<gloss

                            that a small contribution be made to the Independent Radical Movement of
                            the Left (<gloss target="#t_MRII_1">MRII</gloss>—a non-Marxist splinter

                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> coalition) in order to try (a) to keep
                            the Radical movement split and (b) to foster disruption within the

                        <p>New funds in the amount of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not

                        <p>The requested financial support for opposition parties is considered to

                                [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] in support
                            from European sources which the party may use for political action
                            purposes. In general, such support should assist <gloss

                            and <gloss target="#t_PDR_1">PDR</gloss> efforts to oppose <gloss

                            unicameral legislature through a national plebiscite, to prepare for the
                            1973 Congressional elections, and to maintain and increase their mass
                            media capabilities.</p>
                        <p>Support to the <gloss target="#t_MRII_1">MRII</gloss> is designed to open
                            a channel to the <gloss target="#t_MRII_1">MRII</gloss> so that, if and
                            as appropriate developments occur, we are in a position to try to
                            influence the <gloss target="#t_MRII_1">MRII</gloss> to adopt a spoiler
                            role within the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> coalition. The
                            initial contribution would also serve to encourage party cohesion and
                            organization. These goals are consistent with the objectives set forth
                            in the Central Intelligence Agency’s Covert Action Annex to “Options

                            <hi rend="roman">II.</hi> Background</p>
                        <p>The 18 July Valparaiso by-election did not materially alter the political
                            balance of power established by the April municipal elections, which
                            were essentially a stand-off between the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss> and the opposition. If the opposition had lost the
                            Valparaiso by-election the effects would have been profound, since a
                                <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> victory would have demoralized
                            the opposition, created internal problems for the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PN_1"
                            >PN</gloss>, and demonstrated that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> were
                            still gaining strength in a conservative area where the opposition had
                            won only three months earlier. A <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>
                            victory in Valparaiso would also have encouraged <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to convoke a plebiscite to
                            replace the two houses of Congress with a unicameral legislature more
                            responsive to <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> control. Opposition
                            leaders feel that the Valparaiso election may have marked the high point
                            as far as <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> popularity with the
                            electorate is concerned and that economic problems have already begun to
                            erode the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>’s political base. If this
                            assessment is correct, the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> may soon
                            decide to opt for a plebiscite, rather than to wait until economic
                            conditions deteriorate further.</p>
                        <p>In any event, the government has already gained broad control over the
                            economic life of the country and is moving quickly to eradicate the
                            financial base of the free press and the opposition parties. The
                            plebiscite remains a constant threat to Chilean democracy. Under the
                            circumstances, the opposition parties must be able to keep the public
                            informed about <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> plans and pressures
                            while maintaining party organization and discipline in preparation for
                            the plebiscite and the 1973 elections.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_MRII_1">MRII</gloss> split away from the Radical
                            Party (<gloss target="#t_PR_1">PR</gloss>) on 3 August 1971, immediately
                            following the PR’s national convention. The dissidents, who include five
                            senators and seven deputies, issued a lengthy statement criticizing the
                            “rigging” of the convention and the PR’s adoption of Marxist ideology.

                            compete with the Communists and Socialists to retain the allegiance of

                            the government for the last six years. The party has no full-time, paid
                            political activists and relies exclusively on the part-time voluntary

                            targets. As the competence and capabilities of the security forces
                            improve, it is reasonable to expect that the opposition parties and
                            their sources of financial support will receive increasing attention.
                            These political parties must be able to develop convincing attribution

                            been employed successfully by Communist Parties throughout Latin America
                            for years and should prove equally effective for our purposes; double
                            bookkeeping is also a standard Latin American practice. The

                                >PN</gloss> has so far been quite successful and has enabled the

                        <p>The Chilean Constitutional Reform Law for the nationalization of the
                            major copper mines provided for compensation to be determined on the
                            basis of book value (net worth of equity) of the US companies, minus
                            various deductions authorized by the law. Though the size of these
                            deductions might have varied over a broad range depending upon the
                            attitude adopted by the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> in its
                            application of the law, the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> has
                            opted in favor of applying the law in an extremely harsh and punitive
                            manner. This is evidenced both by the President’s determination of the
                            amount of “excess profits” allegedly earned by the companies and by the
                            manifestly unfair position adopted by the government copper corporation
                                (<gloss target="#t_CODELCO_1">CODELCO</gloss>) in objecting to the
                            condition of virtually all of the physical assets at the mine sites. It
                            is apparent that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> could have
                            chosen to act otherwise and that its action represents a conscious
                            political decision.</p>
                        <p>With the publication of the Decree of the Controller General in the <hi
                                rend="italic">Diario Oficial</hi> on Wednesday, October 13, the
                            application of the Constitutional Reform Law, designed to accomplish the
                            complete nationalization of Chile’s major copper production facilities,
                            came within one step of completion. The bill was introduced in the
                            Chilean Senate on December 22, 1970 and, after consideration and passage
                            by the legislature was promulgated as law on July 16, 1971. The only
                            remaining procedural step contemplated by the law is an appeal to an <hi
                                rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> tribunal, established by the law. An
                            appeal to this tribunal may be taken by either the companies or the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> or both. If such an appeal is
                            taken, the tribunal is empowered to finally determine all issues raised.
                            No further appeal may be taken to any other Chilean court. Because of
                            the impor<pb n="464" facs="0504" xml:id="pg_464"/>tance of the law
                            itself and the manner in which it has been applied, a summary of events
                            to date in the nationalization of copper may be useful.</p>
                        <p>It is well known that foreign ownership of the <hi rend="italic">Gran
                                Mineria</hi> copper companies (those producing more than 75,000 tons
                            of fine copper per year) has long been a major issue in Chilean politics
                            and that it has especially been the target of the parties of the Chilean
                            left. Though the Frei government had already entered into agreements for
                            the purchase of 51% of the interests of Kennecott (<hi rend="italic">El
                                Teniente</hi>) and 100% of the interests of Anaconda in Chuquicamata
                            and El Salvador (though title to only 51% had passed to the State by the
                            end of Frei’s term) immediate further action on nationalization was
                            still a major plank in <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            platform. It remained to be seen only what form this action would take,
                            and to what extent agreements freely entered into by the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> under Frei would be honored. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> chose the vehicle of a
                            Constitution Reform Bill, which under Chilean law, is the only means by
                            which the State may void, in whole or in part previous agreements duly
                            authorized and executed by the State.</p>

                            the history of the copper companies and their role in Chile’s
                            development:</p>
                        <p>“The lack of understanding among Chileans concerning the true
                            socio-economic meaning that the exploitation of our basic resources by
                            foreign companies has had for our homeland is astonishing. The North
                            American investment in copper amounted to, originally, a contribution of
                            foreign capital of only $3.5 million. All the rest has come from that
                            same operation. An identical situation resulted in iron and nitrates.
                            The four large US corporations, who have exploited these resources in
                            Chile, have obtained from them, in the last sixty years, income of $10.8
                            billion. If we consider that our total national wealth achieved during
                            400 years of effort, amounts to some $10 billion, we may conclude that
                            in little more than half a century these North American monopolies have
                            taken out of Chile an amount equal to everything created by its citizens
                            in industries, roads, ports, housing, schools, hospitals, businesses,
                            etc. during the whole length of its history. Here is the root cause of
                            our underdevelopment. Because of this we have feeble industrial growth.
                            This is why we have primitive agriculture. This is why we have
                            unemployment and low salaries. To this we owe our thousands of children
                            who have died at early ages. Because of this we have misery and
                            backwardness.”</p>
                        <p>This statement and others made in a broadcast speech on the evening of
                            December 21 (upon signing of the proposed bill for transmis<pb n="465"
                                facs="0505" xml:id="pg_465"/>sion to the legislature) are jarring
                            and typical examples of the repeated attacks on the copper companies by
                            Chile’s Marxist parties for many years. Not only is no positive
                            contribution to Chile’s development recognized, but the companies are
                            accused of direct responsibility for virtually all of Chile’s important
                            economic problems. In addition, in both speeches, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s presentation included key
                            statistics which he or his key advisors must have known to be
                            misleading. The $10.8 billion figure quoted above represents not profits
                            remitted by the copper companies, but rather the total of gross <hi
                                rend="italic">sales receipts</hi> by the copper, iron, and nitrates
                            companies during the past sixty years. Similarly, in his broadcast
                            speech <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> used the figure
                            of $3.7 billion as the amount which “between 1930 and 1969 has left the
                            country to increase the power of the great copper companies which
                            control the copper mines of five continents”. This figure corresponds to
                            the result of the application of a technical legal term “value not
                            returned” as used in the Chilean Copper Code (Law 16,624, Article II).
                            This term does not refer to profit remittances by the companies, rather
                            it refers to the total of foreign currency current account expenditures.
                            The law requires the companies to return to Chile sufficient foreign
                            exchange to meet local operating expenses (wages, purchases of materials
                            and other escudo expenditures) and all Chilean taxes, whether
                            denominated in dollars or escudos, for both current payments (income
                            taxes, wage and salary taxes, etc.) and prepayments (forced loans).
                            These and other minor items constitute “value returned”. Since only
                            current account transactions are considered, investment by the company
                            in Chile is, of course, not included. “Value not returned” is simply the
                            difference between total export proceeds, after adjustment for inventory
                            changes, and “value returned.” Included in “value not returned” are
                            costs of transportation and refining, material purchases abroad, sales
                            commissions, debt service, depreciation, and finally profit
                            remittances.</p>

                            CONGRESS</p>
                        <p>The original bill, so introduced by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>, provided for immediate nationalization of five
                            large US-owned copper mining facilities—Chuquicamata, El Salvador, El
                            Teniente, Exotica and Andina. The first four represented all of the Gran
                            Mineria copper mines in Chile. Andina, however, a mine recently
                            completed and inaugurated by Frei shortly before leaving office, had
                            never produced 75,000 tons of fine copper in any year and was not
                            scheduled to do so for several years. Its special inclusion in the bill
                            is significant in that there do exist several other large mines owned by
                            non-US foreign interests which were not included in the bill.
                            Compensation was to be based on depreciated book value (more accurately
                            net worth of equity), less certain specified categories of
                            deductions—some to be determined by the Controller General and some by
                            the President himself.</p>
                        <p>A summary of some key provisions of the original bill and changes made in
                            these provisions by the Congress points up some of the critical issues
                            involved. First, the original bill provided for the expropriation not of
                            the enterprises, but instead of only the assets of the companies. It is
                            clear that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> had intended, in so
                            drafting the original bill, to eliminate, under Chilean law, rights of
                            all creditors of the mixed companies. The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> would then have been free to choose to pay only those
                            debts which it decided were in its interest to pay, despite the fact
                            that this might have resulted in outright repudiation of duly contracted
                            debts owed not only to the US companies and the EXIMBANK but also those
                            of innocent third parties. This original aim of the bill was reaffirmed
                            by the author of the bill, Eduardo Novoa, in a recent TV appearance,
                            where he stated:</p>
                        <p>“. . . in the Bill presented by the government to the Congress, it would
                            have been possible to nationalize the assets of the companies. . . . The
                            Congress modified this concept, and, instead of expropriating the
                            assets, it introduced a variation, in order to say that what were
                            expropriated were the enterprises. . . . And therefore, not only the
                            assets are included, but also the debts. . . . Under the original
                            version of the bill, on the other hand, the system was exactly the
                            reverse. We would have <pb n="467" facs="0507" xml:id="pg_467"/>acquired
                            all of the assets, without assuming any of the debts—except those that
                            the state might determine and decide to assume.” (A Tres Bandas, October
                            3, 1971)</p>
                        <p>A second feature of the Bill as originally introduced was that it would
                            have required the Controller General, in calculating depreciated book
                            value, to deduct, among other things, an amount corresponding to
                            “depletion of the mines”—this despite the fact that historically,
                            exploitation of the mines had been performed pursuant to the
                            requirements of Chilean law. Moreover, it is of particular interest that
                            the companies had been explicitly prohibited by Chilean law from
                            claiming any deduction in their tax returns to account for depletion so
                            that depletion, in effect, had been provided for in the calculation of
                            income taxes due to the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the original bill required the President to deduct “excess
                            profits,” and to pay any resulting indemnization over 30 years with
                            interest of three percent per annum.</p>
                        <p>Finally, it provided for an appeals tribunal—from which no appeal to the
                            ordinary courts of justice was possible—consisting of five
                            “judges”—three of whom were not judges, or even lawyers, but rather
                            government officials who had been appointed by <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> (President of the Central
                            Bank, Vice President of the National Development Bank (<gloss
                                target="#t_CORFO_1">CORFO</gloss>), and Director of the National
                            Planning Office).</p>
                        <p>During the legislative process, all of the above elements of the original
                            bill underwent significant changes. Congress insisted that the
                            “enterprises” rather than merely their “assets” be nationalized. The
                            proposed deduction for “depletion of mines” was stricken. Though the
                            final bill did empower the President to determine and deduct “excess
                            profits,” the legislators made what they considered an important change
                            in this provision. Whereas the original bill had required that the
                            President deduct “excess profits,” the final bill clearly made the
                            President’s power in this regard <hi rend="italic"
                            >discretionary</hi>—specifically stating that he might deduct <hi
                                rend="italic">“all or part”</hi> of any profits he found to be
                            excessive. This change was accompanied by statements of several
                            legislators to the effect that they hoped that the President would use
                            this discretion wisely. (Private remarks of some of these same
                            legislators were to the effect that if the President were to use this
                            power in a harsh and punitive manner, resulting problems for Chile with
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and others could be laid
                            squarely at his door). The critical point however is that in the final
                            version of the bill, this power was, without doubt, a discretionary
                            one.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, the President was given discretionary power over the terms of
                            payment to the companies. The final bill provided that the terms of
                            payment could be for <hi rend="italic">no longer than</hi> thirty years
                            with interest at <hi rend="italic">not less than</hi> three percent per
                            annum, whereas terms of 30 years and 3% had been mandatory in the

                            qualified lawyers. Nevertheless, it is important to note that three of
                            the five members actually appointed to this tribunal are <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> appointees and known partisans
                            of the Unidad Popular. Only the remaining two are members of the
                            independent judiciary.</p>
                        <p>The Bill as finally approved, thus, provided that the Controller General
                            would determine the amount of indemnization to be paid to the US
                            companies by calculating book value (less depreciation and disallowing
                            any revaluations of assets taken by the companies after December 31,
                            1964) and deducting from that figure two major items: (1) the value of
                            equipment and machinery found to be in “deficient condition for use” by
                            the state and (2) the amount which the President directed him to deduct
                            as excess profits.</p>
                        <p>In summary, the law began with the concept of depreciated book value (net
                            worth of equity) and provided for the possibility of various deductions
                            from that amount—principally (1) items of equipment received in
                            “deficient condition for use” and (2) “excess profits” as determined by
                            the President. Assuming that properly functioning facilities had been a
                            necessary element in the profitability and high productivity of these
                            companies, it is apparent that the value of items to which objections
                            were made could have been relatively minor. Likewise, the amount
                            deducted for “excess profits” could have varied over a very broad range
                            depending on how the President chose to define and calculate such
                            profits, and upon whether he decided to deduct “all or part” of them so
                            determined. In short, indemnity due to the companies could have ranged
                            from a very low value to a value closely approximating net worth of
                            equity—depending upon the intentions of the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> and the degree of fairness and good faith exercised in
                            the application of the terms of the bill. To these questions we now

                            CONTROLLER GENERAL</p>
                        <p>In order to determine which items, if any, were in “deficient condition”,
                            the Controller set up five technical commissions (one for each
                            nationalized mine). The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> assigned to
                                <gloss target="#t_CODELCO_1">CODELCO</gloss> (the government copper
                            corporation) the responsibility for making objections to those items of
                            machinery and equipment which it considered (within the meaning of the
                            law) to be in “deficient condition for utilization”. The companies, in
                            turn, were requested to nominate representatives to participate in the
                            work of the technical commissions so as to be able to de<pb n="469"
                                facs="0509" xml:id="pg_469"/>fend the “objected” assets against
                            allegations made by <gloss target="#t_CODELCO_1">CODELCO</gloss>. Though
                            normal procedural fairness would have called for <gloss
                                target="#t_CODELCO_1">CODELCO</gloss> to bear the burden of proving,
                            or at least providing some evidence to support, allegations that a given
                            item was in deficient condition for use, this was not the procedure
                            followed. Instead, <gloss target="#t_CODELCO_1">CODELCO</gloss> merely
                            drew up a list of 25 general objections and then proceeded to list
                            virtually every item of equipment at each mine—placing next to the
                            listed item several numbers (in many cases as many as seven or eight)
                            referring to the list of stock objections. The companies were then put
                            to <hi rend="italic">their</hi> proof that the listed objections did not
                            exist. This obvious procedural unfairness is many times magnified when
                            this list of stock objections is examined. Several examples of listed
                            objections follow:</p>
                        <p>(I) An item was deemed “deficient” if it was “old” without regard to
                            whether or not it continued to fulfill its function. <gloss
                                target="#t_CODELCO_1">CODELCO</gloss> thereby chose to ignore that
                            such an item was carried on the books at a very low value or indeed at
                            no value at all—despite the fact that it was still in place and
                            functioning adequately.</p>
                        <p>(II) Items were considered “deficient” if they had certain worn
                            parts—despite the fact that these parts were ones normally expected to
                            wear out and be replaced—and that they constituted only a minute portion
                            of the value of the item as a whole (e.g. the entire mill at
                            Chuquicamata was objected to on the grounds that some rotating
                            machinery—racks and pinions—were worn). Such components normally wear
                            out and are replaced many times during the useful life of such
                            machinery.</p>
                        <p>(III) A fleet of virtually new specially constructed 100 ton trucks was
                            objected to on the grounds that the trucks had a “high cost of
                            maintenance”.</p>
                        <p>(IV) A 1970 wagoneer was objected to on the ground that it used too much
                            fuel.</p>
                        <p>Of the list of twenty-five stock objections, only two obviously responded
                            to a fair interpretation of the statutory language—exclusion of items
                            (1) which no longer existed or (2) which could no longer perform a
                            useful function.</p>
                        <p>In summary, <gloss target="#t_CODELCO_1">CODELCO</gloss>’s list of
                            objections completely ignored the concept of depreciation (which is
                            inherent in the determination of book value) and asserted that an asset
                            was in “deficient condition” if it was not virtually perfect.</p>
                        <p>Not satisfied to stop there, <gloss target="#t_CODELCO_1">CODELCO</gloss>
                            then went on to assert that for each item to which an objection had been
                            made, the amount required to be deducted from depreciated book value was
                            not the amount at which the objected item was carried on the books, or
                            even the original cost of the item, but rather the cost of replacing
                            such item with a new one today. In the most extreme case (and there are
                            such ex<pb n="470" facs="0510" xml:id="pg_470"/>amples among the
                            objected assets), an item which had been completely depreciated on the
                            books—and for which the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> would
                            therefore not have had to include any amount in calculating book
                            value—would, according to <gloss target="#t_CODELCO_1">CODELCO</gloss>,
                            have served as the basis for a deduction from depreciated book value of
                            the purchase price of a new item in the market today. Since the
                            “objected” item had not contributed to book value in the first place,
                            such a deduction would then have resulted in cancelling out payment for
                            other assets received by the State, whose value <hi rend="italic"
                                >had</hi> been included in the calculation of book value.</p>
                        <p>The total amount of deductions calculated on this basis by <gloss
                                target="#t_CODELCO_1">CODELCO</gloss> exceeded $1 billion.</p>
                        <p>While this grossly unfair position might have been understandable as
                            merely the work of certain overzealous bureaucrats at <gloss
                                target="#t_CODELCO_1">CODELCO</gloss>, it then became the subject of
                            an extensive legal justification by the State Defense Council. The
                            opinion attempted to give full legal justification for <gloss
                                target="#t_CODELCO_1">CODELCO</gloss>’s list of stock objections,
                            and for the use of replacement cost as the measure of the
                            deductions.</p>
                        <p>The President of the State Defense Council is Eduardo Novoa, (drafter of

                            out, or destroyed, that are of no use in the work. The idea is that the

                                <gloss target="#t_CODELCO_1">CODELCO</gloss>, was well aware that

                        <p>In accordance with Article II (17) (b), President <persName

                            the amount of “excess profits” earned by the companies since 1955 and to
                            require the Controller General to deduct <pb n="471" facs="0511"
                                xml:id="pg_471"/>“all or part” of that amount from book value (after
                            all deductions accepted by the Controller). The law set forth several
                            standards which the President might consider in making his
                            determination—these being (1) the normal rate of return obtained by the
                            companies in the totality of their international operations (2) the
                            maximum return permitted pursuant to international agreements concerning
                            foreign investments to which Chile is a party, (a reference to the
                            Andean Group Foreign Investment Code) and (3) the norms established
                            between the state and the nationalized companies with respect to
                            preferential dividends (overprice tax). Though there is some discussion
                            among Chilean lawyers on the interpretation of this provision, it is
                            generally agreed that the President was free to choose among the
                            suggested norms. In this regard it is interesting to note that figures
                            released by Anaconda show dividends received by Anaconda, as a
                            percentage of net worth of the two Chilean operating companies (Chilex
                            and Andes), to have been 13.39%, on an annual average basis during the
                            period in question. This is less than the maximum generally permitted
                            under the Andean Foreign Investment Code—and even the Andean Code makes
                            an exception to the 14% rule for mining enterprises.</p>
                        <p>What <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> chose to do, rather
                            than expressly using any of the criteria contained in the statute, was
                            to determine that any profit in excess of 10% of book value was
                            “excess.” He then directed the Controller to deduct only the amount in
                            excess of 12% of book value from the net amounts arrived at by the
                            Controller. It is important to note, however, the manner in which these
                            calculations were made. The “profits” used in the calculations were not
                            the amounts remitted from Chile to Anaconda and Kennecott as dividends.
                            Rather they were the total net profits of the companies during this
                            period, thus disregarding profits reinvested. Moreover, the President
                            did not consider any of the years in which the operating companies
                            earned less than 12% on average net worth. He simply took the years in
                            which profits, according to his method of calculation, had exceeded 12%
                            and added up the overage. As a result, Andes/El Salvador, which had
                            earned in excess of this percentage for only the years 1966–70 was
                            nevertheless charged with “excess profits” of $64 million. The final
                            amounts which the President required the Controller to deduct were:
                            Chuquicamata—$300 million; El Salvador $64 million; and El Teniente—$410
                            million. In the case of El Teniente, if the amount deducted by the
                            President is added to the amount of profits already paid to the <gloss

                        <p>The Controller General, to his considerable credit, refused to accept all
                            but a small percentage of <gloss target="#t_CODELCO_1">CODELCO</gloss>’s
                            objections to the phys<pb n="472" facs="0512" xml:id="pg_472"/>ical
                            properties of the nationalized companies. He did however increase the
                            liabilities of the companies by the total amount of termination benefits
                            (indemnity for years of service) which the mixed companies would have
                            been required to pay to their employees if they had gone out of business
                            on December 31, 1971. He accepted the argument that this indemnity was
                            in the nature of a fixed liability, despite the fact (1) that the
                            companies had never been permitted to take any deduction for future
                            indemnity for tax purposes, and that (2) it is reasonably clear that, as
                            a legal matter, the mixed companies continue to exist under Chilean law.
                            Nevertheless, when the Controller completed his calculation of book
                            value, less the amount of deductions which he had been designated to
                            consider, the result was that over $380 million remained to the credit
                            of the three major companies. The Controller, however, had no power to
                            alter in any way the amount which the President directed him to deduct
                            for “excess profits,” and the result, as is now well known, is that
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s deductions not
                            only completely wiped out the remaining balance but left a negative
                            value for the three major companies of approximately $400 million.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> has attempted to justify this
                            extremely harsh application of the law on various grounds. It has been
                            suggested that the President had no choice under the law but to make the
                            deductions that he did. It is apparent, however, that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> did have broad discretion,
                            both as to the choice of the applicable standard to be used for
                            determining excess profits, and as to whether he would direct the
                            Controller to deduct “all or part” of the amount he determined to be
                            “excess.”</p>
                        <p>The action has been defended in numerous official statements as a lawful
                            and sovereign decision of the Government of Chile—though such statements
                            choose to ignore sovereign acts of government of Chile in 1967 and 1969,
                            when agreements were reached with the companies for the purchase of 51%
                            of El Teniente and 100% of Chuquicamata and El Salvador. Finally,
                            official spokesmen have placed great reliance on United Nations
                            Resolution 1803 of December 19, 1962, which recognizes “the inalienable
                            right of all States freely to dispose of their natural wealth and
                            resources in accordance with the national interest.” They do not however
                            choose to point out the following critical provisions of that
                            resolution: “The exploration, development and disposition of such

                            desirable with regard to the authorization, restriction, or prohibition
                            of such activities.”</p>

                            expropriate the large copper companies reflects the will of the Chilean
                            people as expressed in an unobjectionable and democratic way through
                            constitutional channels . . . Roosevelt’s foresight in Mexico and
                            Eisenhower’s lack of foresight in Cuba were the determining factors
                            which caused diametrically opposed political developments in the two
                            countries . . . Once one has taken the position that one is attacked,
                            nothing is easier than to justify reprisal as indispensable means of
                            defense. With reprisals, one can say when and how they shall begin, one
                            cannot say what they might lead to and how they might end.” (From

                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> announced on 28
                                September that $774 million in excess profits would be deducted from
                                the compensation offered the two major US mining companies. In
                                effect, this virtually precluded any prospect of significant
                                compensation. This was confirmed on 11 October when Chile’s
                                Comptroller General ruled that the companies were entitled to no
                                compensation for the three major copper mines that were
                                nationalized, and in fact owed the state $378 million. He indicated
                                that no effort would be made to collect this debt, since it is not
                                authorized by the constitutional amendment. Although regime
                                spokesmen have intimated that excess profits accrued by the Chilean
                                Government itself during the period when it owned 51 percent of the
                                nationalized mine would be subtracted from <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s determination, this will
                                not alter matters sufficiently to provide the companies with
                                compensation. [Footnote is in the original.]</note> Despite the
                            desire of most Chileans to avoid a major clash with the US, there
                            appears to be a broad consensus favoring strong measures against the
                            copper companies. In fact, it may well be the only issue where <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> can count on solid opposition
                            backing. This high degree of consensus among Chileans was underscored
                            last July when the opposition-dominated Chilean Congress unanimously
                            approved the constitutional amendment authorizing copper
                            nationalization. It allowed <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> discretionary authority to deduct past “excess
                            profits” in calculating compensation.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s decision came after
                            his own Socialist Party stridently demanded that no compensation be
                            paid. In contrast to certain hardline party colleagues who hoped that
                            US-Chilean relations thereby would be irreversibly damaged and the
                            revolution radicalized, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            probably desires to maintain normal relations with Washington in spite
                            of the copper dispute. He has a strong interest in preventing a
                            severance of US-Chilean ties, if only to maintain access to traditional
                            sources of international credit and to US spare parts and technology.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> appears to calculate
                            that if Chile drags out the appeals proceedings and holds open the
                            possibility that it will honor much of the debts of the copper companies
                            to foreign (mostly US) creditors, current US-Chilean tensions can be
                            reduced.</p>

                            provoking US reprisals. He will be faced with a number of delicate
                            problems that could seriously affect his overall political position. Low
                            foreign currency reserves, lagging agricultural production, relatively
                            low world prices and <pb n="476" facs="0516" xml:id="pg_476"/>uncertain

                            1972. The Chilean Government has already instituted some restrictions on
                            imports, and <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has now
                            announced his intention of renegotiating payment provisions on Chile’s
                            foreign debts—debts that amount to some 2.3 billion and have been
                            requiring annual service costs equivalent to about one-third of Chile’s
                            export earnings.</p>
                        <p>4. Some everyday consumer goods are in short supply, and if these
                            shortages spread, as seems likely, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s political base may erode. He already has
                            grounds for some concern over diminishing support for his regime. The
                            ruling coalition’s defeat in a congressional by-election last summer and
                            its disappointing showing in recent student and trade union elections
                            may be symptomatic of declining regime popularity. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, apparently in hopes of
                            strengthening his political hand, has just presented legislation to
                            create a unicameral legislature and to effect far-reaching domestic
                            reforms. If the congress rejects the proposal, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> may choose to call a
                            plebiscite next year to decide the issue. Should <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> then—or at any other
                            time—sense that he is in danger of losing political control, pressures
                            for focusing attention on a foreign scapegoat by provoking a crisis with
                            the US would mount.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> clearly is sensitive
                            to the desire of the Chilean military to maintain ties with the US
                            military. But, once again, if he perceived that military opposition to
                            his regime were on the rise, he might view a confrontation with the US
                            over the copper issue as a method of undercutting uniformed dissidents.
                            There is now evidence that high-ranking Chilean military officers are
                            taking soundings among their comrades in order to ascertain the degree
                            of support a future move against the regime could obtain. At least for
                            some time to come, however, any prospects for military intervention will
                            be limited by a number of important factors. The Chilean military have a
                            tradition of non-intervention in political matters, and there is doubt
                            about the ability of the carabineros and the military to unite in
                            anti-regime efforts. Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> has been skillful in his efforts to curry favor
                            among the security forces. Military men, like other Chileans, take pride
                            in Chile’s constitutional system. They are aware that unless <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> flouts the constitution or
                            economic problems produce large-scale unrest, most civilian opposition
                            elements would oppose a coup. And without broad public support, military
                            leaders would probably remain reluctant to move against <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>.</p>
                        <p>6. Whether <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> intentionally
                            provokes a confrontation with the US or whether one comes about as a
                            consequence of US retaliation he hopes to avert, certain immediate
                            political benefits would accrue to the regime. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would be almost certain to use
                            charges of US “economic aggression” to justify his own economic reverses
                            and to promote revolutionary elan among the workers, just as <persName
                                corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName> has done with re<pb
                                n="477" facs="0517" xml:id="pg_477"/>spect to the US blockade for
                            more than a decade. Furthermore, he would probably utilize any reprisals
                            to bolster his own political support and to intimidate the opposition.
                            By posing as a Chilean David manfully facing an avaricious Yankee
                            Goliath, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> effectively
                            could equate his own interests with that of the nation as a whole. Since
                            Chileans set great store in legality and are proud of their long record
                            of constitutional self-government, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s hand will be strengthened considerably, in any
                            showdown with the United States, by the constitutional basis for his
                            actions on copper issues.</p>
                        <p>7. In these circumstances, Christian Democrats and other political
                            opponents of the regime might feel constrained to proffer at least
                            nominal support to government initiatives they would otherwise oppose,
                            rather than court charges of aiding and abetting the enemy during a
                            national emergency. For example, if <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> were to institute belt-tightening measures that
                            were necessitated by his own blunders, the opposition normally would
                            react by charging him with compelling the Chilean masses to pay for his
                            ineptitude. But if he could credibly argue that stringent steps were
                            necessary to cope with an international credit squeeze engineered by the
                            US, his adversaries might perceive no alternative to “rallying round the
                            flag.”</p>

                        <p>8. Considering the current high pitch of nationalistic feeling in much of
                            the region, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would have
                            at least the sympathy of a number of Latin American states. This would
                            be the case not only because of the cool US-Latin American relations
                            currently prevailing, but also because of the skill with which he has
                            neutralized apprehensions that his electoral victory had initially
                            engendered among other Latin American states. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> frequently has drawn sharp
                            contrasts between the Cuban and Chilean revolutions. From the first, he
                            stressed that he did not share <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel
                                Castro</persName>’s messianism, and that his government would
                            scrupulously adhere to non-interventionist principles. He was of course
                            mindful that Latin American support for US efforts to isolate Cuba was
                            related in part to a perceived threat of Cuban subversive intervention,
                            and he no doubt wanted to avoid a similar vulnerability. Out of
                            deference to the sensitivities of neighboring states, he chose to
                            postpone <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName>’s visit,
                            first meeting with Argentine, Peruvian, Ecuadorian, and Colombian
                            leaders. To further mollify Chile’s neighbors, regime spokesmen have
                            argued that expanded ties with Communist states would not in any way
                            compromise Chilean independence. And <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> has countered fears of a Soviet military
                            presence in Chile by saying that his regime would not permit any foreign
                            bases on its soil and by categorically denying that a Soviet credit for
                            purchasing military equipment has been extended.</p>

                        <p>9. The Chilean contention that problems with US copper companies should
                            not be converted into problems with the US Government, probably strikes
                            a sympathetic chord in many Latin American states. If the US Government
                            invokes economic reprisals, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> might argue that these measures are actually
                            prompted by his avowed Marxism, and not the requirements of US
                            legislation. Since the United States did not apply the <persName

                            the military regime expropriated the US-owned International Petroleum
                            Company without subsequent compensation, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> could charge that Chile was the victim of
                            discriminatory treatment. This would augment the broad-gauged
                            nationalist support the regime would enjoy at home and also serve to
                            promote sympathy for Chile among its Latin American neighbors.</p>
                        <p>10. In such international forums as the Organization of American States,
                            most members would be likely to condemn rather than support any US
                            sanctions against Chile on the copper issue. Increasingly, the US has
                            found itself standing accused and almost alone at meetings of
                            inter-American organizations. On a broad gamut of issues, ranging from
                            the application of the 10 percent surcharge to Latin America to the
                            violation of Ecuador’s claims of a 200 mile limit, the US has been
                            virtually isolated. Even regimes like that in Brazil which tend to take
                            a dim view of the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            regime, are likely to be hostile to any effort that could be construed
                            as a US ploy to multilateralize an essentially bilateral problem. In
                            this context, suggestions that the level of new US investment in Latin
                            America as a whole might be adversely affected by Chilean actions toward
                            the US copper companies would be likely to add to Latin American
                            resentment. To some extent the general climate of Latin American opinion
                            may have been revealed by a motion passed at a meeting of the Latin
                            American Parliament in Caracas in August. It saluted Chile’s copper
                            nationalization and reproved the United States for pressuring Chile by
                            withholding Export-Import Bank loans.</p>
                        <p>11. While the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> would be unlikely to
                            censure Chile or back US counteractions for the confiscation of copper
                            holdings, it is also improbable that it would pass a resolution
                            upholding Chile’s actions. The US could no doubt muster enough votes to
                            block such an initiative. What is more likely, however, is that
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would seek to muster
                            broad international support elsewhere. The <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> Conference on Trade and Development (<gloss
                                target="#t_UNCTAD_1">UNCTAD</gloss>) meeting slated for Santiago in
                            April could provide him with an ideal forum for marshalling such
                            backing. At the recent Lima meeting of the Special Latin American
                            Coordinating Commission, convened to formulate a Latin American position
                            for the <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD_1">UNCTAD</gloss> conclave, Chile
                            successfully pushed through a resolution condemning any political or
                            economic measures restricting a country’s right to dispose of its
                            economic resources as it sees fit. There may be <pb n="479" facs="0519"
                                xml:id="pg_479"/>considerable bombast in the assertion of some
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> partisans that his
                            declaration of retroactive excess profits constitutes a new “<persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> Doctrine” applicable to much
                            of the underdeveloped world. Nevertheless, the notion is widely accepted
                            among less-developed countries that the major industrial countries have
                            reaped huge profits while robbing them of their natural resources.
                            Consequently, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s thesis
                            could win broad sympathy from participants in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNCTAD_1">UNCTAD</gloss> meeting, enhancing Chile’s
                            status as a “Third World” luminary.</p>
                        <p>12. In sum, given the climate of opinion prevailing in Chile and in Latin
                            America as a whole, US acts of retaliation for Chile’s refusal to
                            provide “prompt, adequate, and effective compensation” to the mining
                            companies would probably fortify <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s political position at home and engender
                            considerable sympathy abroad. Regardless of the merits of the case under
                            international law, there would be a widespread tendency to view US
                            counteractions as an exercise in dollar diplomacy. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would be apt to emerge as

                                >Allende</persName> government to prevent its consolidation and

                            interests (<gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 93).</p>
                        <p>3. To strengthen elements in the Chilean political spectrum, including
                            the military, which will resist extreme policies and to give these
                            elements to understand that our differences are not with the Chilean
                            nation but with policies of the present Government of Chile.</p>
                        <p>4. To minimize the acceptance and emulation of the Chilean example in
                            Latin America and elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>5. To maintain the principle of just compensation for expropriated
                            investment under international law.</p>
                        <p>6. To obtain the eventual payment of the Chilean debt of nearly $1

                        <p>7. To protect the U.S. Government interest represented by the over $300
                            million exposure of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation in
                            investment insurance, and to protect remaining uninsured U.S. pri<pb

                        <p>The Chilean government’s decisions to provide little or no compensation
                            for the major expropriated copper investments have been appealed by all
                            three of the affected investors to the Special Tribunal provided for
                            under the copper amendment to the Constitution, but there is little
                            expectation of significant relief. Now that the companies have taken
                            this action to formalize the exhaustion of their local remedies, there
                            are constraints against open and formal U.S. action against Chile until
                            the appeals process is completed or until the Tribunal by its own
                            actions has confirmed the inadequacy of this recourse. As for remaining
                            un-expropriated American investment in Chile, there is still some
                            possibility that reasonably acceptable settlements might be reached
                            between some, but not all, of the investors and the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government.</p>
                        <p>The relative weight to be assigned to each of the U.S. objectives set
                            forth in Part I will influence the choice of option. Actions taken in
                            pursuit of some objectives could affect the accomplishment of others.
                            For example, our success in not giving the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> government a basis on which to rally domestic
                            and international support for consolidating the regime would be affected
                            by the nature and intensity of the pressures which we apply to the
                            regime to prevent its consolidation and to limit its ability to
                            implement policies contrary to U.S. and hemisphere interests.</p>
                        <p>The principal objectives of the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> regime appear to be (a) to consolidate its
                            position internally and (b) to accomplish a socialist revolution in
                            Chile. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> may also seek to
                            play a leading role among third-world countries and to provide a
                            socialist example for other countries, but these are secondary
                            considerations to survival.</p>
                        <p>We have up to now followed a policy of correct but cool relations with
                            Chile. The coming to a head of the copper compensation issue has meant
                            that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> can no longer claim
                            credit, as he did on occasion, for successfully managing relations with
                            the United States. He had no domestic opposition to his copper policies,
                            and has probably wrung from them the political benefit obtainable from
                            them as such. His next logical step would be to seek to unify his people
                            behind him in defense against a foreign threat—alleged U.S. economic
                            coercion—and he has lost no opportunity to lay the groundwork for this
                            effort. It is apparent that he needs a scapegoat for his coming economic
                            difficulties, and a strong nationalist issue with which to justify
                            imposition of more stringent economic and political controls.</p>
                        <p>Continuing economic deterioration in Chile is not in question. Even the
                            provision of major foreign credits could only affect the pace <pb
                                n="482" facs="0522" xml:id="pg_482"/>and degree of this process.
                            Thus the primary significance of the provision or non-provision of most
                            credits would be political rather than economic.</p>
                        <p>Barring an unforeseen substantial increase in the price of copper,
                            Chilean debt payments to the United States will inevitably be either
                            stretched out or repudiated. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> on November 9 formally declared his intention to
                            seek renegotiation of Chile’s foreign public debt, and we expect to
                            receive on November 29 a direct official invitation to participate.
                            Consultations between the interested Washington agencies already have
                            been initiated to gather the essential facts relating to the Chilean
                            debt and to prepare for the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            decision on a response. Our posture with respect to renegotiation, in
                            conjunction with other major elements in our policy toward Chile, will
                            bear directly on the question of whether the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime will continue to
                            recognize its debt obligation to the United States or will repudiate
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The Chilean experiment, combining independence from U.S. influence with
                            sweeping social change carried out with a show of legalistic deference
                            to pluralism, has inherent appeal in Latin America. The extent to which
                            this appeal is manifested in political developments in other countries
                            would depend on (a) the evident success or failure of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime; and (b) whether

                            attribute his difficulties to external factors.</p>

                            applying counter measures, by depriving the U.S. of the argument that
                            all specific modes of settling the dispute had been exhausted before
                            recourse was had to these measures.</p>
                        <p>—Would give the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime
                            the pretext for repudiating its debt of nearly $1 billion to the U.S.
                            Government and thereby obtain immediate debt burden relief at our
                            expense.</p>
                        <p>—Would prejudice the compensation prospects of other U.S. firms still in
                            Chile whose properties have been or would be nationalized, some insured

                        <p>A special election will be held on 16 January 1972 to fill two vacant
                            seats in the Chilean Congress. The Christian Democratic Party (<gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>) and the National Party (<gloss
                                target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss>) have agreed that a single opposition
                            candidate will run in each by-election. <persName corresp="#p_MR_1"
                                >Rafael Moreno</persName> of the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> will be the candidate for his party’s former seat in
                            the 5th Senatorial District and Sergio Diez of the <gloss
                                target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss> will run for Deputy in the Linares
                            District. Both men are strong candidates, but past voting patterns
                            indicate that the races will be extremely close. Popular Unity (<gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>), the government coalition, has just
                            officially named its candidates, and it is evident from the caliber of
                            the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> nominees that the government is
                            going all out to win in January.</p>
                        <p>These by-elections must be viewed in the context of the uncertain
                            political atmosphere developing in Chile as the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss> government enters its second year in power. The
                            political opposition is becoming increasingly bold, unified, and
                            effective while the government finds itself <pb n="490" facs="0530"
                                xml:id="pg_490"/>being confronted with mounting problems and
                            situations which must be faced and on which political capital must be
                            expended.</p>
                        <p>At the same time the political opposition is becoming increasingly
                            dependent on external (and U.S. Government) financial support. A total
                            of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] is requested
                            for the January by-elections, [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not

                                amount not declassified</hi>] for the Deputy contest.</p>
                        <p>The proposal has the concurrence of the Ambassador, the Deputy Chief of
                            Mission, and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American
                            Affairs. The funds requested are not available within the Agency budget
                            and would have to be sought from the Agency Reserve for
                            Contingencies.</p>

                            <hi rend="roman">II.</hi> Present Situation</p>
                        <p>As the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government enters
                            its second year, it is evident that the opposition has acquired new
                            strength and confidence. The organizations and media that are
                            financially supported by the Santiago Station have been in the forefront
                            of this increased resistance to the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> regime. This new opposition spirit is evident
                            not only in the political parties themselves, but also in professional,
                            labor and women’s organizations which are reorganizing with a new
                            vitality and purpose. Non-Marxist forces have recently won important
                            victories in union and student elections. The opposition newspapers, led
                            by <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> and including <hi rend="italic">La
                                Prensa</hi> of the Christian Democratic Party (<gloss

                            of the National Party (<gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss>), carry a
                            regular fare of strong editorials against the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss> and extensive criticism of government policies.
                            Opposition radio stations, the newscasts on Catholic University’s TV
                            Channel 13, and a number of weekly publications responsive to different
                            sectors of the opposition also contribute to the increasing sense of the
                            opposition unity which cuts across party lines.</p>
                        <p>In Congress, parliamentarians belonging to the opposition parties have
                            united to block the passage of two bills which the government considers
                            essential: one of these, which defines three areas of the Chilean
                            economy (social, mixed and private), would enable the government
                            virtually to eliminate free enterprise; the other would replace the two
                            houses of Parliament with a single Popular Assembly. The government may
                            call for a national plebiscite on either of these two issues. In
                            addition, opposition parliamentarians have moved to block a Presidential
                            attempt to dissolve Congress by tabling a bill that would make it
                            mandatory for the President to resign and call new elections if the
                                <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> should lose a national
                            plebiscite.</p>
                        <p>In the University of Chile, a protracted battle between Marxist and
                            non-Marxist forces has already led to bloodshed and sparked violence in
                            other universities throughout the country. <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"

                            supporting the Rector of the University against the government. This
                            power struggle is still unresolved, but the opposition is pushing for a
                            University plebiscite on 21 December.</p>
                        <p>Opposition parties are also cooperating with Chilean businessmen in a
                            campaign to try to stop the government from taking control of the
                            nation’s largest paper company. State control of newsprint could mean
                            the end of the free press in Chile, and an opposition “Freedom of
                            Expression” fund has been set up to buy paper company shares, while a
                            massive publicity campaign urges the company’s shareholders not to
                            accept the government’s offer to buy their shares at higher than market
                            prices. This was the first organized public effort to oppose the Popular
                            Unity program, and preceded the 1 December women’s march. This march,
                            which was organized by the opposition to protest food shortages and the
                            climate of violence in Chile included some 30,000 women of all ages and
                            social strata. Independent women’s groups [<hi rend="italic">1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] participated in the march along with <gloss
                                target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>
                            women’s organizations. The peaceful marchers were attacked by
                            rock-throwing <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> supporters and
                            dispersed by police tear grenades; repercussions have been so great that
                            a State of Emergency has been declared in Santiago Province. The three
                            radio stations controlled by the opposition were closed by the
                            government, but reopened on 2 December.</p>
                        <p>While the political opposition has become increasingly bold, unified and
                            effective, the government has begun to suffer the consequences of its
                            own economic policies. Shortages of basic commodities, particularly food
                            products, have become a major political issue, and these shortages are
                            expected to become more severe in the first quarters of 1972. Internal
                            dissensions between the parties comprising the Popular Unity coalition
                            and a bitter power struggle within the Socialist Party have added to the
                            problems facing the government, which is having increasing difficulty in
                            controlling its more radical supporters, especially the Movement of the
                            Revolutionary Left (<gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss>). The <gloss

                            agitating for violent confrontation with non-<gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss> forces, a confrontation they believe is essential to win

                            candidates in the two by-elections which will be held on 16 January
                            1972. There will be only one opposition candidate in each race:
                                <persName corresp="#p_MR_1">Rafael Moreno</persName> of the
                            Christian Democratic Party (<gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>) will
                            compete for the 5th Senatorial District area which represents the
                            provinces of O’Higgins and Colchagua and was left vacant by the death of
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> Senator Jose Isla. Sergio Diez
                            of the <pb n="492" facs="0532" xml:id="pg_492"/>National Party (<gloss
                                target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss>) will run for the seat in the Linares
                            District left vacant when <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss> Deputy
                            Carlos Avendano fled to Australia. Although neither the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> nor the <gloss target="#t_PN_1"
                                >PN</gloss> will openly endorse the other’s candidate, there is an
                            agreement that both parties will covertly support each other’s
                            candidates in the two by-elections. The small Democratic Radical Party
                                (<gloss target="#t_PDR_1">PDR</gloss>) will also support both of
                            these candidates.</p>
                        <p>An analysis of past voting patterns in the by-election areas covered
                            indicates that both races will be close. The 5th Senate District
                            statistics give the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> candidate,
                            Socialist labor leader Hector Olivares, an even chance for election, so
                            that the outcome may well be decided by the intensity of effort as well
                            as the effectiveness of the campaign strategy and tactics employed by
                            the opposition. In Linares, a statistical analysis slightly favors the
                                <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> candidate who is the sister of
                            Chile’s first agrarian reform “martyr”. Both districts are primarily
                            agricultural areas which have been the scene of recent violence as the
                            result of illegal land occupations. Thus, the elections will be held in
                            a political climate which is increasingly tense and polarized. A large
                                anti-<gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> vote is essential to provide
                            tangible evidence of the government’s unpopularity and to maintain the
                            momentum and cohesion of opposition forces. The loss of these elections
                            would check the forward impetus of the opposition, but may not be too
                            disheartening provided that a strong opposition showing is made.</p>

                        <p>The opposition candidate in this district, where there are approximately
                            155,000 registered voters, is <persName corresp="#p_MR_1">Rafael
                                Moreno</persName> Rojas, a 35-year-old agricultural engineer.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MR_1">Moreno</persName> was only 28 when he
                            was appointed by former President Frei to the highest office of the
                            Agrarian Reform Corporation (<gloss target="#t_CORA_1">CORA</gloss>)
                            which carried out the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>’s agrarian
                            reform program. Because of <gloss target="#t_CORA_1">CORA</gloss>’s
                            function (expropriating lands which had not been used efficiently and
                            turning them over to the campesinos), <persName corresp="#p_MR_1"
                                >Moreno</persName> has been a target of past criticism by the <gloss

                                >Moreno</persName> is, however, well-known and popular in the

                            being coordinated by Ricardo Valenzuela, the remaining <gloss

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MR_1">Moreno</persName>’s opponent will be
                            Socialist Hector Olivares, president of the Copper Workers’
                            Confederation who is currently a Deputy from O’Higgins Province.
                            Olivares, who has long been a top labor leader at the El Teniente copper
                            mine, is expected to be a potent candidate. He is familiar to the
                            electorate and has proven voter appeal in O’Higgins, where he finished
                            second among the six successful parliamentary can<pb n="493" facs="0533"
                                xml:id="pg_493"/>didates in the 1969 Congressional elections.
                            Olivares’ personal popularity, coupled with the fact that the Socialist
                            Party is the strongest of the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> parties
                            in both O’Higgins and Colchagua Provinces, means that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MR_1">Moreno</persName> will face the strongest possible
                            competition.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Linares District</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Carlos Avendano, the <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss> Deputy who fled
                            to Australia, continued to draw his salary as Deputy for a full year
                            after his departure—the time when he was required by law either to
                            appear in Congress or to resign from office. This fact will undoubtedly
                            be played to the hilt by the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>, so that
                            the <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss> candidate in this district starts
                            with a handicap. The <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss>, however, has
                            come up with a candidate who is well liked by all the opposition parties
                            and who can mobilize their support: Sergio Diez Urzua, a 46-year-old
                            lawyer and university professor who was a Deputy from 1957 until 1965.
                            Diez’ candidacy was officially announced on 1 December, and the campaign
                            began immediately with a rally and press conference. Diez has named his
                            brother, a member of the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>, to be his
                            campaign manager and enlisted Silvia Alessandri, niece of the former
                            President, to handle the women’s vote. There are approximately 56,000
                            registered voters in Linares.</p>
                        <p>Diez’ campaign organization will include “Committees for Democratic
                            Unity” in district wards. Radio time has already been contracted for,
                            and plans made for street and wall writing, slogans, and press
                            publicity. Basic themes will be land for the people who work it, defense
                            of the “little” man, independence of the commercial sector from state
                            control, and anti-Communism. Diez will attempt to emphasize points of
                            similarity between his stance and that of <persName corresp="#p_MR_1"
                                >Moreno</persName> in the 5th Senate District. In addition to Diez’
                            own campaign, the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> will be working
                            independently through its own provincial organizations to insure a
                            maximum <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> effort on Diez’ behalf.</p>
                        <p>Strong <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> support will be essential to
                            Diez, since the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> candidate will be
                            Maria Eliana Mery, whose brother Hernan, then a young <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> leader and local chief of the Agrarian
                            Reform Corporation (<gloss target="#t_CORA_1">CORA</gloss>), was killed
                            by land owners during an April 1970 expropriation scuffle. Miss Mery
                            represents the Organization of the Christian Left (<gloss
                                target="#t_OIC_1">OIC</gloss>) which split from the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> in early August 1971 and which has
                            just formally joined the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>. Miss Mery
                            will presumably run as an independent, since the <gloss
                                target="#t_OIC_1">OIC</gloss> has not been registered as a party
                            long enough to be able to run a candidate in its own right. Although
                            Miss Mery is an unknown quantity as a campaigner, the <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> is evidently counting on the aura of her
                            surname in a rural constituency where a high proportion of the voters
                            are campesinos. Her candidacy also represents a clever <gloss

                            the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_PN_1"

                        <p>Senator Ibanez called twice, once on <persName corresp="#p_HAC_1">Ashley
                                Hewitt</persName> and once on <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Arnold
                                Nachmanoff</persName>. Mr. Hewitt sat in on the meeting between Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Nachmanoff</persName> and Senator
                            Ibanez. In the course of both interviews, Senator Ibanez made virtually
                            the same presentation. He explained in some detail the campaign of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> Government against
                            the oppo<pb n="495" facs="0535" xml:id="pg_495"/>sition, especially the
                            opposition media, indicating that the government’s tactics are to
                            squeeze off sources of financing one after another until it is no longer
                            possible to conduct an effective opposition. The Senator emphasized the
                            importance of opposition media to maintaining effective opposition, and
                            said that if the government is effective in emasculating the opposition
                            media, all hope of eventually replacing the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> Government by peaceful and democratic means
                            vanishes.</p>
                        <p>Senator Ibanez underlined the importance of the media at the present time
                            due to the upcoming by-elections in January 1972. This election will be
                            the first time the opposition will be able to register its strength
                            since the municipal elections of last April. He added that unfortunately
                            the government’s tactics of squeezing off sources of financing are
                            having considerable success, and advertising in the opposition media has
                            virtually vanished.</p>
                        <p>Without actually framing an explicit request, Senator Ibanez strongly
                            suggested that financial assistance from the US to the opposition would
                            be highly desirable at this time. He asked if the proper place to
                            explore problems of this kind was with our Ambassador in Santiago, or
                            here in Washington.</p>
                        <p>Both Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Nachmanoff</persName> and Mr. Hewitt
                            listened sympathetically to Senator Ibanez’ presentation, indicated
                            concern with the problems faced by the opposition in Chile, and promised
                            that the information and views he conveyed would be brought to the
                            attention of the proper people in the government. In response to Senator
                            Ibanez’ question about the proper place to raise problems of this kind,
                            both Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Nachmanoff</persName> and Mr.
                            Hewitt indicated that the opposition should, by all means, stay in touch
                            with our Ambassador in Santiago and see that he understands the problems
                            being encountered by the opposition. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NA_1"
                                >Nachmanoff</persName> and Mr. Hewitt did not comment further on
                            this question.</p>

                        <p>In conjunction with similar requests to other creditors, the Government
                            of Chile on November 29 formally requested the United States to
                            participate in negotiations for the rescheduling of Chile’s external
                            debt. The Chileans stated their preference for bilateral negotiations
                            with the U.S. They also informed us that Chile had declared a unilateral
                            moratorium effective November 12 on debt servicing, except for
                            short-term commercial payments and those to international financial
                            institutions. They later requested ninety day deferments from the U.S.
                            and certain other creditors pending renegotiation of debts.</p>
                        <p>The State Department has held extensive discussions with other agencies
                            over the past several weeks on the nature of the response which the U.S.
                            Government should give to the Chilean request for debt rescheduling.
                            After receiving authority from the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>,
                            the Department notified the Chileans that the U.S. would participate in
                            multilateral debt discussions which are scheduled for early February in
                            Paris. The French, as chairmen of the Paris Club of creditors, were also
                            notified. The State Department provided data and analysis of the options
                            to the National Advisory Council and asked the <gloss target="#t_NAC_1"
                                >NAC</gloss> to provide technical advice to the negotiators on
                            various financial issues.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                            <hi rend="roman">2.</hi> The Chilean Request</p>
                        <p>The request for rescheduling comes at a time of serious deterioration of
                            Chile’s internal and external economic position. Chile’s foreign
                            reserves, which were approximately $365 million a year ago, are now
                            estimated to be slightly below $100 million. These are expected to
                            decline further in view of copper production difficulties in Chile, the
                            softness of copper prices, and the growing need for imports,
                            particularly of foodstuffs. The Chileans have estimated that about 40%
                            of the foreign exchange earnings expected for exports in 1972 and 1973
                            would be required to meet external debt servicing; however, this
                            analysis is still to be confirmed by the Paris Club creditors.</p>
                        <p>We believe that the major Chilean motivation in seeking the rescheduling
                            is straightforward, that is, to obtain relief from its external <pb
                                n="498" facs="0538" xml:id="pg_498"/>debt burden and thus to avoid
                            an imminent foreign exchange crisis. We also believe that the present
                            Chilean default on payments to the U.S. will continue if there is no
                            debt relief, but that the Chileans wish to formalize relief through a
                            rescheduling agreement which would allow them to maintain a certain
                            degree of respectability in international financial markets. Finally, we
                            suspect that the Chileans may also have in mind setting up a situation
                            in which President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> can
                            blame foreign countries, particularly the United States, for internal
                            austerity measures if the rescheduling negotiations fail.</p>

                        <p>The U.S. has approximately $1.5 billion outstanding to Chile, of which

                        <p>The United States has several conflicting objectives which need to be
                            reconciled: we do not want to help <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> any more than necessary with debt relief at a
                            time when he faces a real economic crisis; we do not want to allow
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to exploit our
                            actions for his own internal and external political benefit; we want to
                            use debt relief as a means of obtaining assurances regarding the payment
                            of debts owed by the nationalized companies; and we want to avoid a
                            lengthy default or possible repudiation of debts to United States
                            official and private creditors.</p>
                        <p>The Chilean request for debt relief comes at a time of great political
                            delicacy in our relations with Chile and the hemisphere. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DN_1">Davis</persName> and the Chilean
                            opposition forces are urging that we maintain our posture of quiet
                            restraint and not give <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> a
                            pretext for rallying his divided nation against a “foreign devil”. At
                            the same time, domestic opinion in the United States may be sensitive to
                            our giving debt “relief” to a country which has recently expropriated
                            the assets of U.S. companies without providing adequate compensation,
                            unless it is understood that debt relief is a way of protecting our
                            creditor interest against continued default. (We have already learned
                            that Anaconda wishes to avoid confrontation in the debt renegotiations,
                            preferring to use the discussions to encourage whatever progress is
                            possible.)</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DN_1">Davis</persName> has pointed out
                            the likely adverse effects of invoking the <persName corresp="#p_HBB_1"
                                >Hickenlooper</persName> Amendment at a time when there are
                            compelling reasons for not initiating a confrontation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. Our reason for not invoking
                            it <hi rend="italic">now</hi> is that we believe negotiation will be
                            more productive in protecting our economic and political interests. The
                            basis for not invoking it is that the appeals process has not been
                            completed. The <pb n="499" facs="0539" xml:id="pg_499"/>benefits of
                            invoking the Amendment on the economic side would be mainly symbolic
                            since there have been no new <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> loans
                            in almost two years and disbursements have been proceeding at a slow
                            rate on the $20 million remaining in the <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss> pipeline. The Eximbank has stopped disbursements
                            completely as a banking measure in response to default. However, both
                            the State Department and the Defense Department feel strongly that
                            disbursements on military credits (amounting to $8 million) should not
                            be suspended so long as legally possible in view of the potential role
                            of the Chilean armed forces as a center of opposition to <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The rescheduling of debt to protect U.S. creditor interests is not
                            considered to be assistance within the meaning of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_HBB_1">Hickenlooper</persName> Amendment. Therefore,
                            even if the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> were to invoke the
                                <persName corresp="#p_HBB_1">Hickenlooper</persName> Amendment
                            before debt renegotiations were concluded, it would not preclude us from
                            reaching a settlement on debt.</p>
                        <p>Debt relief would appear to be inconsistent with our objective of giving
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> as little help as
                            possible in overcoming his balance-of-payments problems. However, if
                            Chile does not get relief, it will almost certainly continue in default
                            on its debts to us. Therefore, the impact of debt relief on the Chilean
                            balance of payments will be considerably less than the results of a
                            continued default if we can obtain a reasonably tough formula through
                            our participation in multilateral negotiations. There is a reasonable
                            prospect that deferral of debt service can be limited to less than the
                            three years requested by the Chileans, and possibly to less than all of
                            Chile’s principal and interest obligations during the period. In this
                            case relief would be less than Chile could obtain through a continued
                            default. We also believe that the level of new credits which Chile could
                            obtain by regularizing its debts will be very much lower than in the
                            past and will not be greatly improved, certainly with respect to U.S.
                            creditors, as a result of our participation in a debt relief
                            exercise.</p>
                        <p>A more detailed analysis of the impact of debt relief on the balance of
                            payments is contained in Annex B and Table VIII. The National Advisory
                            Council has been requested to provide additional data.</p>

                        <p>Our participation in a debt rescheduling exercise is complicated further
                            by the possibility that a debt rescheduling agreement might be ready for
                            signing before or about the time the special copper appeals tribunal in
                            Chile will render its decision, which is expected to deny adequate
                            compensation to the companies. It should be noted, however, that our
                            participation in the Paris Club negotiations does not irrevocably commit
                            us to signing an agreement with the Chileans if we later decide that it
                            is not to our advantage to do so.</p>
                        <pb n="500" facs="0540" xml:id="pg_500"/>
                        <p>We anticipate that the rescheduling exercise will proceed at a moderate
                            pace during the multilateral stage of the negotiations. Subsequently,
                            assuming that the terms of debt relief are worked out in concert with
                            other creditors, we would then have more flexibility on the pace of the
                            bilateral discussions with the Chileans prior to signing an agreement.
                            The expectation is that we would sign, given the total debt at stake and
                            the external politics involved, but there might be domestic fallout in
                            the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Any obvious efforts to slow the pace of multilateral negotiations might
                            lead to confrontation with the Chileans and resistance from other
                            creditors. However, the actual signature of the agreement could be
                            delayed, if necessary, in order to observe political developments within
                            Chile at a time when increasing austerity will probably be accompanied
                            by growing internal dissatisfaction and unrest. In addition, a
                            deliberate negotiating pace allows more time to assess the Chilean
                            intent to pay its loan to Kennecott and to observe somewhat more fully
                            the copper appeals process and the Chilean Government’s final intentions
                            regarding compensation. These issues are discussed separately below.</p>

                            constitution.</p>
                        <p>The agencies are agreed that we should seek confirmation from the
                            Chileans that they will repay these debts and any others which may
                            result from future nationalization. We should inform other creditor
                            governments early in the negotiations that debt assumption will be one
                            of our objectives, and be prepared to adapt our tactics to their
                            responses and the amount of support we can expect from them. The manner
                            of our injection of this issue into the talks, and the degree to which
                            we insist on Chilean recognition of this link at the outset, are
                            important to the achievement of our objectives.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> can also seek Chilean
                            recognition during the negotiations that all expropriation-related

                            undertaken by the Chilean Government in connection with current
                            nationalizations, should be included in Chilean public debt. By
                            introducing nationalization costs into the discussion, it will be
                            possible to mobilize sentiment among other creditor nations for urging
                            restraint on Chile with regard to new takeovers, so as to avoid
                            incurring additional external obligations during a payments crisis. It
                            will also be possible to argue that uncertainties regarding the <pb

                            known.</p>
                        <p>The debts of the nationalized companies can be divided into at least four

                            This loan arises from the 1967 partial nationalization of copper when

                            these notes, therefore, is different from that of the Kennecott debt.
                            Since <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has already
                            committed himself publicly to an excess profits determination which
                            would appear to cancel out any compensation, and since the prospects of
                            this action being reversed by the Chilean special appeals tribunal are
                            very slim, the notes are close to being repudiated and assurance for
                            their payment would be extremely difficult to obtain.</p>

                            <hi rend="roman">2.</hi> The Compensation Issue</p>
                        <p>All agencies are agreed that compensation for the expropriated assets of
                            United States companies is not a realistic objective in the context of
                            debt renegotiations. The assessment is that it would be futile and
                            disruptive to raise compensation as an absolute condition for debt
                            relief since this would simply lead to a political confrontation. There
                            is agreement, however, that every reasonable effort should be made to
                            protect and improve the position of the expropriated companies.</p>
                        <p>By pressing for a compensation link in the context of debt
                            renegotiations, we introduce a highly sensitive issue with a strong
                            potential for political exploitation by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>. We also run the risk of losing the cooperation
                            of other creditors by introducing an issue which they may feel is
                            primarily of bilateral significance to the United States. Therefore, the
                            agencies are agreed that priority should be given to debt assurances,
                            which may be achievable, rather than to compensation, which is not.</p>
                        <p>In spite of these disadvantages, the sensitivity of the compensation
                            issue for domestic and Congressional opinion in the United States and
                            for our overseas investment in general requires that compensation be
                            raised in some manner during the talks. The attitude of the companies
                            will be an important element in determining the extent to which we raise
                            the issue.</p>
                        <p>For the reasons cited above, the agencies believe that compensation
                            should be raised at the discretion of the negotiators when they perceive
                            appropriate opportunities for injecting it into the talks.</p>

                        <p>The Chileans have asked for a rescheduling of principal and interest due
                            on both government loans and supplier credits in each of the three years
                            1972–74, with a grace period of three years and repayment over an
                            additional ten years. This compares with the 1965 Chilean rescheduling
                            which provided only for 70% of principal on supplier credits for two
                            years, with a grace period of two years and repayment <pb n="503"
                                facs="0543" xml:id="pg_503"/>over five additional years. Other Latin
                            American reschedulings in recent years have been on fairly hard terms
                            and confined largely to supplier credits. The consolidation interest
                            rates were more or less the commercial rates prevailing at the time.</p>
                        <p>The agencies are agreed that the terms of the present rescheduling should
                            be made as hard as possible within the limits of the Chilean ability to
                            pay, so that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is forced
                            to take responsibility for his own economic policy failings. This
                            objective could best be served by seeking to limit debt relief to less
                            than the period requested by the Chileans, and hopefully to less than
                            all of the principal and interest due.</p>
                        <p>The State Department has already calculated several hundred rescheduling
                            options on the computer, using various assumptions regarding the amount
                            of principal and/or interest, the period of consolidation, the grace
                            period, the repayment period, and rates of interest. A sample listing is
                            provided in Table XIII attached.</p>

                                >IDB</gloss> Participation in a Rescheduling Exercise</p>
                        <p>The World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank have not, with two
                            minor exceptions, participated in debt exercises by rescheduling their
                            own debt, although they have at times provided additional financial
                            assistance to countries in debt difficulty. The motivations of these
                            institutions are to protect their credit ratings in the bond markets,
                            and to avoid having to make up their reduced income by asking the very
                            same creditor countries either to replenish their funds or to permit
                            further borrowing on their capital markets.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> has announced that it will not
                            seek rescheduling of its debts to the international financial
                            institutions, although it has indicated that it might be obliged to do
                            so if new credits were not forthcoming from the Banks. At the moment,
                            however, the Banks have no incentive to participate in a rescheduling,
                            since payments are continuing on their loans.</p>
                        <p>The chief advantage of Bank participation in a rescheduling exercise is
                            to assure equal burden sharing for all creditors. Since the Banks took
                            the same risks in lending to Chile, the renegotiation of their loans
                            along with other creditors would be consistent and equitable. The Banks
                            might also adopt a tougher attitude in support of stabilization programs
                            for Chile if their own resources were at stake, and it would establish a
                            precedent for Bank participation in future rescheduling exercises.</p>
                        <p>All agencies are agreed with the general principle of equal burden
                            sharing for the international financial institutions. There may be
                            disadvantages, however, in applying this principle to the Chilean case.
                                <pb n="504" facs="0544" xml:id="pg_504"/>Among these is the risk
                            that it would complicate our pending legislation at a time when the
                            appropriations outlook is unclear, and would therefore be an
                            inappropriate time to urge the Banks to initiate a new policy which
                            might affect their bond markets. The Banks themselves would oppose such
                            an initiative and might be supported by a majority of other
                                creditors.<note n="3" xml:id="d95fn3">Thus far, five other creditors
                                have indicated their desire to have the World Bank participate, but

                                partner in rescheduling. [Footnote is in the original.]</note>
                            Finally, it may not be desirable to go beyond what the Chileans have
                            asked for, since a rescheduling of the Banks’ loans would relieve Chile
                            of about $25 million annually in payments which it is now committed to
                            make. This argument may not be sustainable if the terms of the
                            rescheduling agreement can be varied so that overall payments remain
                            about the same.</p>

                            the debtor country. Of the seventeen reschedulings thus far, fourteen
                            involved a standby for the debtor country.</p>
                        <p>The Chileans have already stated that for political reasons they are
                            unwilling to request a standby if it means submitting to the discipline

                            situation. An anticipated decline in export earnings due to falling
                            copper prices and reduced output levels will cause the debt service
                            ratio to rise much higher than the 22% originally forecast for
                                1971.<note n="5" xml:id="d95fn5">The Chileans anticipate that the

                                figures have yet to be substantiated by an independent source.
                                [Footnote is in the original.]</note> In addition, the rapid
                            increase in imports and the decline in capital inflows during the last
                            12 months are expected to reduce net international reserves from $367
                            million in December 1970 to less than $100 million at the end of 1971
                            (not counting <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> and SDR positions). A

                            remaining reserves during 1972, and for this reason the Chilean
                            Government is taking severe measures to protect its balance-of-payments
                            position.</p>

                            position was headed for serious difficulties. Since then, the <persName

                            reactions have served to worsen considerably this balance-of-payments
                            outlook. Chile’s investment atmosphere has become clouded by
                            expropriations and interventions, and private sector confidence has been
                                af<pb n="506" facs="0546" xml:id="pg_506"/>fected by continuing
                            uncertainties regarding the future policies of the Government. This
                            uncertainty has affected both domestic and foreign investors alike, and
                            they have reacted by cutting back drastically on planned increases in
                            investments. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s wage and
                            income redistribution policies, involving a freeze on prices and a 30%
                            across-the-board increase in wages, have affected the profitability of
                            investment in Chile, and the demand for goods and services is far
                            outstripping the economy’s ability to produce. In 1971 excess demand was
                            satisfied in part through increased import levels, but the drain on
                            reserves combined with declining export levels has led to the current
                            balance-of-payments crisis.</p>
                        <p>Chile’s balance of payments difficulties in 1972 will be worsened by
                            several domestic problems. The continuing shortfall in agricultural
                            production will add to import demand. The domestic incomes policy and
                            government deficits will continue to stimulate demand, domestic
                            inflation, and again import demand. Despite rigid price controls, an
                            inflation rate of about 20% for 1971 is predicted. Private
                            investment—both domestic and foreign—has fallen off noticeably during
                            the last two years and will have to be stimulated or replaced with
                            public investment. In either case, a rise in the level of investment
                            will require additional imports if production levels are not to be
                            seriously affected in 1972. Finally, the oft-cited need for worker
                            discipline and greater productivity is critical in the copper sector
                            which provides 80% of the necessary export earnings, as well as in
                            industries with a high potential for import substitution. In contrast to
                            1971, the shortage of foreign exchange in 1972 will determine to a far
                            greater extent the range of economic policy options open to <persName

                            credits, but the outlook is far from optimistic. In 1971, disbursements
                            were expected to be $442 million, of which $240 million were from
                            private creditors. However, new credits <pb n="507" facs="0547"

                            sources have declined in 1971 and disbursements from the pipeline in
                            1972 will be substantially reduced. The outlook for increased flows from
                            government or private sources under present circumstances is not good,
                            unless the Socialist countries step in to fill the gap.</p>

                            be high because of unfamilarity with bloc trading arrangements, the

                        <p>On November 9 President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            announced his government’s intention to seek a renegotiation of Chile’s
                            outstanding foreign debt, and on November 29 the Chilean Ambassador
                            submitted a formal request for debt rescheduling to the United States.
                            The Chileans informed us that they had suspended debt service on
                            November 12 on all obligations to major creditors with the exception of
                            short-term commercial debts and obligations to the World Bank group and
                            the Inter-American Development Bank. Debts to minor creditors “which by
                            virtue of their insignificant amounts have little importance in terms of
                            the service of the country’s foreign debt” will also be excluded. The
                            countries concerned are mainly in Latin America.</p>
                        <p>The creditor countries with which Chile wishes to renegotiate its debts
                            are listed in Annex C–2. A notable omission from the list is the Soviet
                            Union, which has larger scheduled repayments in 1972–74 than at least
                            seven of the “major” European creditors. It is not clear whether the
                            Soviet Union will be approached for debt rescheduling, but according to
                            an informal report from an <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>
                            official, the Chileans would <pb n="508" facs="0548" xml:id="pg_508"

                            perhaps in the form of program loans (Annex D).</p>
                        <p>The Chileans are also approaching private creditors for rescheduling, and
                            a meeting was held on December 14 with 43 United States banks in New
                            York under the joint Chairmanship of First National City Bank and the
                            Bank of America. The Chileans proposed a three year grace period on
                            maturities falling due in 1972–74, followed by seven years repayment.
                            The banks replied that this would be unsatisfactory and made a
                            counter-proposal which is summarized in Annex F. We are keeping in
                            contact with the banks.</p>
                        <p>With regard to current payments, the Chileans failed to make two interest
                            payments to <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> amounting to $223,000
                            which fell due before the November 12 cut-off date. They subsequently
                            promised to make these payments and to make exceptions of two more small
                            interest payments amounting to $207,000 which fell due after November
                            12. They then asked for a ninety day deferment which <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> declined, and the payments have not
                            yet been made.</p>
                        <p>On November 30, the Chileans defaulted on a payment to the Eximbank, and
                            on December 7 the Eximbank suspended disbursements, insurance, and
                            guarantees to Chile. The Department of Agriculture was asked to defer
                            repayments due on December 31 for ninety days, but declined in view of
                            the pending debt renegotiations.</p>

                        <p>The Chileans have suggested a rescheduling of principal and interest due
                            in each of the three years 1972–74 (plus apparently the last six weeks
                            of 1971 after the November 12 cut-off date) with a grace period of three
                            years and repayment over an additional ten years. This compares with the
                            1965 terms which provided for rescheduling of 70% of principal <hi

                            involving the United States, and in this connection we have learned that

                            multilateral negotiations, at least in the early stages. (Annex E) Japan
                            stated that it probably would prefer multilateral talks, but its
                            decision would be influenced by the position taken by the United

                            The most extreme position on this subject was taken by France. It stated
                            that multilateral negotiations could not take place without US
                            participation. This categorical statement was based on France’s

                            participate. Germany, however, although publicly stating to Chile that
                            negotiations would not be possible without US participation, said in
                            private to US officials that it would not rule out multilateral
                            negotiations which excluded the US, if the US and Chile preferred

                        <p>Only Germany appears to have been advised by the Chileans that debt
                            service payments were suspended on November 12. Belgium, Canada, and
                            Japan, however, have informed us of overdue payments to private or
                            public creditors. The Belgian creditor was told that the <pb n="510"
                                facs="0550" xml:id="pg_510"/>payment, due on October 24, was being
                            included in the debt negotiation. The Japanese firm was requested to
                            extend the November 30 due date by 90 days.</p>
                        <p>None of the countries has stated that Chile should resume servicing its
                            debt as a precondition to the renegotiation meetings (although as
                            mentioned above only Germany was informed that Chile had suspended its
                            payments). France was specifically asked to agree to a moratorium on
                            payments until January 31, 1972, but refused on the grounds that this
                            kind of step could only be taken in the framework of multilateral
                            negotiations. Italy stated that by law it would be required to suspend
                            disbursements if repayments were suspended. No other country expressed
                            an opinion on this subject.</p>

                            is proposing to reactivate the Paris Club as a multilateral forum for
                            the discussion of Chile’s debt problem. The French suggested a meeting
                            of creditors for late November, which we and other creditors indicated
                            would be premature. They are now thinking of a meeting in early
                            February. Thus far Italy, Canada, the Netherlands, and Switzerland have
                            indicated that they would respond favorably to such an invitation. The
                            Chileans have also indicated willingness to participate now that the

                        <p>At the end of 1970, Chilean external public debt amounted to over $2.6
                            billion (including undisbursed and amounts due from prior
                            nationalizations). The U.S. is by far the largest creditor with almost
                            $1.4 billion outstanding or 57% of the total. This amount includes loans
                            from <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> of approximately $900 million.
                            The remainder is due to private banks, suppliers, other financial

                            during the period will amount to 32% of total loans outstanding, which

                            have to postpone a larger proportion of their credits in a

                        <p>Debt relief is designed to salvage the maximum level of repayment
                            possible for US creditors when the alternative would be total default.
                            Since Chile is already in default and is likely to remain so until a
                            rescheduling agreement is signed, debt relief in some form will be
                            needed to bring about a resumption of payments.</p>
                        <p>The effect of the Chilean balance of payments will depend on the duration
                            of the present default, the terms of the rescheduling, and the level of
                            new credits that Chile can expect to receive. It is clear that the
                            Chileans will obtain balance-of-payments relief whether there is
                            agreement on rescheduling or not, since a default would have much the
                            same effect as debt relief if obtained on the terms they have requested.
                            The main questions are how much debt relief <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> can obtain, and what effect a continued default

                        <p>If Chile can obtain debt relief on the terms it has suggested it could
                            defer almost $900 million in principal and interest over the next three
                                years,<note n="8" xml:id="d95fn8">This amount would be reduced by
                                payments of consolidated interest, which, at an assumed 6% rate,

                            which half would be due to the United States. This assumes that the

                            generous than those agreed upon in the 1965 rescheduling. It is more
                            likely that the creditors will insist on a more limited term with only
                            partial debt coverage which would limit the scope of relief and require
                            corrective policies before further relief could be considered.</p>
                        <p>If a rescheduling agreement is reached, the Chileans could expect to
                            maintain some degree of respectability in international financial <pb

                            whether Chile reschedules or not, and for this reason Chile might
                            benefit more from a selective default on United States obligations than
                            it would from a rescheduling. The same reasoning does not apply to
                            European creditors where the flow of private credits might continue or
                            even expand to fill the gap left by the United States if Chile
                            successfully reschedules.</p>

                        <p>If the Chileans fail to obtain debt relief, they will probably continue
                            to default on payments and thereby obtain relief in any event, but at
                            the cost of losing a large part of the foreign credits (and
                            disbursements from the pipeline) which would otherwise have been
                            available from traditional sources. Any attempt to estimate the flow of
                            new credits into Chile in the next three years would be highly
                            speculative. However, it can be assumed that a total default, which
                            would save Chile $300 million a year in debt service, would be somewhat
                            counterbalanced by a decline in new credits from all sources, unless the
                            Chileans can obtain additional credits from the Socialist countries.</p>

                        <p>TDCS DB–315/00374–72. Summary. On 11 January Army General <persName
                                corresp="#p_CMA_1">Canales</persName> declared that his military
                            coup movement is ready to move against the Chilean Government at any
                            time. He stressed, however, that a valid reason must exist for any such
                            move, in order to ensure that the subsequent military government would
                            be accepted by a majority of the civilian population. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CMA_1">Canales</persName> claimed that his capabilities
                            to carry out a successful coup have increased during the past two
                            months, despite the attempts by the government to remove those officers
                            who are considered to be opposed to the present regime from important
                            commands in the Santiago area. <persName corresp="#p_CMA_1"
                                >Canales</persName> made some references to the support he enjoys
                            among the Chilean military and revealed that his tactical plans simply
                            call for the implementation of existing contingency plans, with which
                            the army unit commanders are already familiar. End summary.</p>

                        <p>1. In a conversation [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] on 11 January 1972 General <persName
                                corresp="#p_CMA_1">Canales</persName>, former Director of the War
                            Academy, declared that the Chilean armed forces are ready to take over
                            the Chilean Government at any time. However, he stressed that the
                            military must wait until a very valid reason exists in order that the
                            subsequent military government would be accepted by a majority of the
                            civilian population.</p>
                        <p>2. In discussing possible pretexts, <persName corresp="#p_CMA_1"
                                >Canales</persName> mentioned that he would consider it sufficient
                            justification should a number of deaths occur as a result of conflicts
                            between opposition and government forces in the 16 January special
                            by-elections, should the government lose the by-elections and then
                            refuse to abide by the results, or should the government use subterfuge
                            to avoid or refuse to abide by a possible adverse decision by the
                            constitutional tribunal which is considering the constitutionality of
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s appointment of
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGJ_1">Jose Toha</persName> as acting Minister
                            of Defense.</p>
                        <p>3. (Field comment: The special by-elections entail the election of a
                            Deputy from Linares Province and a Senator from Colchagua and O’Higgins
                            Provinces. There is no indication that the government would refuse to
                            accept the electoral results. Former Interior Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_TGJ_1">Toha</persName> was automatically suspended from
                            his position upon the approval by the House of Deputies of the
                            impeachment charges against him. The charges are now to be considered by
                            the Chilean Senate. On 7 January, the day following the House action,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> appointed
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGJ_1">Toha</persName> acting Minister of
                            Defense. The political opposition considers this action unconstitutional
                            and has announced that it will ask that the special constitutional
                            tribunal be constituted to consider the case. A field grade officer who
                            is well informed on internal army politics [<hi rend="italic">less than
                                1 line not declassified</hi>] commented on 13 January that the
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGJ_1">Toha</persName> episode has not created
                            much of an impact within the army.)</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_CMA_1">Canales</persName> said that should his
                            coup plans come to fruition, his tactics will simply be to put into
                            operation one of the existing military contingency plans, with which all
                            unit commanders are familiar. (Source comment: <persName
                                corresp="#p_CMA_1">Canales</persName> did not reveal what plans he
                            has to seize the Ministry of Defense and its communication facilities in
                            order to be able to issue the necessary orders to implement the
                            contingency plans.)</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_CMA_1">Canales</persName> also remarked that his
                            capabilities within the army to mount a successful coup are greater at
                            the present time than they were two months ago, despite the fact that
                            the recent, end-of-year changes in military assignments were studied
                            carefully by the U.P. government and, within its capability, were made
                            with the political expedient in mind of removing from key positions
                            those officers who are known to be opposed to the regime. He mentioned
                            that his own removal from the War Academy and that of Colonel Carlos
                            Forrestier from the Infantry School are examples of the governmental
                            maneuvering.</p>
                        <pb n="516" facs="0556" xml:id="pg_516"/>
                        <p>6. Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_CMA_1">Canales</persName> claimed
                            to have the unconditional loyalty of about 80 middle grade officers, as
                            a result of his two years at the War Academy, plus most of the officers
                            who served with him on the faculty of the Academy, many of whom now
                            command regiments. Specifically, <persName corresp="#p_CMA_1"
                                >Canales</persName> said that Colonel Luis Joaquin Ramirez Pinedo,
                            the new Tacna artillery regiment commander, who was his deputy at the
                            war college; and Colonel Felipe Geiger, new Buin infantry regiment
                            commander, will support him in any coup effort. He added that Colonel
                            Leonil Konig Altermatt, who replaced Colonel Forrestier at the Infantry
                            School, is an excellent officer and is opposed to the regime; however,
                            since Konig has just recently come to Santiago, <persName
                                corresp="#p_CMA_1">Canales</persName> said he has not had time to
                            bring him into his coup movement. <persName corresp="#p_CMA_1"
                                >Canales</persName> remarked that his biggest problem at the present
                            time is not the enlistment of additional support among key regimental
                            commanders, but rather the ability to restrain his supporters until the
                            proper time and to prevent any premature action.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_CMA_1">Canales</persName> did lament the
                            upcoming transfer of Admiral Luis Eberhard, former Commander of the
                            First Naval Zone, to Washington, D.C., since he had been counting
                            heavily on Eberhard, who had 10,000 sailors and marines under his
                            command, to take over and hold the port city of Valparaiso. However,
                                <persName corresp="#p_CMA_1">Canales</persName> said that he intends
                            to confer with Eberhard before his departure to see who can be brought
                            in as a replacement. (Field comment: Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_MCJT_1">Jose Merino</persName> is Eberhard’s replacement
                            as head of the First Naval District.) (Source comment: Admiral Daniel
                            Arellano, who is scheduled to replace <persName corresp="#p_MCJT_1"
                                >Merino</persName> as fleet commander, is a weak officer with a
                            drinking problem. Arellano refused to cooperate in the abortive coup
                            attempt in October 1970 which was designed to prevent <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> from being named President of
                            Chile.)</p>
                        <p>8. (Field comment: The foregoing information is still largely
                            insufficient to make an accurate judgment on the extent of his movement
                            or the probability of success, should he launch a coup. However, the
                            foregoing does indicate that <persName corresp="#p_CMA_1"
                                >Canales</persName> himself feels confident of his capabilities and
                            is marking time until he is presented with the required pre-text with
                            which to justify his actions. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                            source whose reliability has not been fully tested, reported that
                            Lieutenant Colonel Carol Urzua, Commander of the Puente Alto Engineering
                            Regiment, was involved in military coup plotting. The latter reference
                            indicated that the plotters were also looking for the necessary pretext
                            for their coup attempt. Since Urzua has been reported in the past to be
                            a follower of Colonel Carlos Forrestier, who is considered to be General
                                <persName corresp="#p_CMA_1">Canales</persName>’ right-hand man,

                            talking. Now, here again—normally, you’d think this clearly fell within
                            the Treasury’s provenance, but State’s asserting jurisdiction over it.
                            As a matter of fact, <persName corresp="#p_WS_1">Weintraub</persName> at
                            State has already told the Chilean Ambassador that we’re not only going
                            to Paris, but we’re going to, we’ll renegotiate, before we ever get
                            there.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Well, they ought to—the
                            son-of-a-bitch is not supposed to do that, because I’ve issued an order
                            through <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> a day ago. You
                            know about the order that you and I had—and when I say “ordered”—</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: I told Henry, at the time
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> came in, we were not
                            to do a damned thing to help him. Absolutely nothing! Now, is this—I
                            don’t want to get Henry involved, because he’s in enough fights with
                            State at the moment.</p>

                            have to even fight it—</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Look, I’ll just say—let
                            me say, John, I am totally opposed to it.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: And we’re not going to do
                            it.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>: I’ve got a—I’ve got a

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Well, what—what is the

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>: Well, I’m not going to
                            send you the actual memorandum if you agree with it. I just said that, I
                            think, Treasury ought to head the delegation to the Paris Club meeting.

                            circumstances. No, sir, we’re not about to—</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: And then for us then, for
                            the Paris Group to do this—the Paris Club—is ridiculous.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>: Yeah. Well, they—their
                            answer is, “Well, they’ve defaulted. If we don’t renegotiate, we’ve got
                            to set a new maturity date.” I said, “Well, what the hell good is a new
                            maturity date? You’re kidding yourself.” I said, “If they’ve defaulted,
                            they’ve defaulted. Let’s try to impose some kind of sanction. Let’s try
                            to make them pay us.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Can I ask you to do this,
                            Bob? As I said, we’ve got Henry in too many fights with State at the
                            moment. Anyway, this is an awfully good one for <persName
                                corresp="#p_FPM_1">Flanigan</persName> to follow up on in every
                            instance. Now, when <persName corresp="#p_FPM_1">Flanigan</persName>
                            ever—in the future, if you would have such matters—I don’t want him to
                            hide them with Henry, you understand. I just don’t want Henry to get his
                            bowels in an uproar and raise hell with <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                                >Rogers</persName>. But <persName corresp="#p_FPM_1"
                                >Flanigan</persName> will just toe the line. Don’t you agree?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>: I agree. That’s the
                            way to handle it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Yeah, and let’s do it
                            right. Let’s do it—to hell with them. You see, <persName
                                corresp="#p_PPG_1">Pete’s [Peterson]</persName> quite aware. When
                            you talk to Pete, he’ll love <pb n="520" facs="0560" xml:id="pg_520"
                            />this, too. He’ll love getting into this kind of thing. Good heavens,
                            this is so—such a direct violation of what I, what I’ve said. You know,
                            you—I mean, basically, John, I may be wrong about Chile. I mean, many
                            people think I am—and about Cuba—but, after all, it’s what I—somebody’s
                            got to make the policy and, Goddamnit, I’ve made it!</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>: That’s right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: In my view, Cuba, you’re
                            not—you can’t—you can’t, for example—State is always trying to make end
                            runs on the Cuban thing, and I say, “No, we’re not going to do it. I’m
                            not going to do it there. They’re different from China. We’re just not
                            going to do anything with Cuba at the present time.” And we’ve just got
                            to get—it’s either got to be one way or the other.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>: Yeah.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: I mean, they got to—they
                            weren’t elected. That’s the point—another thing those guys forget.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>: That’s right.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: And I take the heat. They
                            don’t.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>: That’s right. It’s
                            your policy and you’re entitled to make it. And if it’s wrong, you’re
                            entitled to the blame—</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: And I’ll get it.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1">Connally</persName>: And if it’s right, you

                            an uproar about it, but my attitude—I [unclear] <persName

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: And when <persName

                            about it, because I—you know, because usually we’re up on such things.
                            And he said, “Well, gee whiz, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: But what in the hell

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: They’re for economic

                        <p>On 5 November 1971 the Committee approved new funds in the amount of [<hi
                                rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] for the following
                            twelve-month period to support Chilean political parties opposed to the
                            Popular Unity (<gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>) coalition of
                            President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Salvador Allende</persName> and
                            to influence the Radical Party of the Left (<gloss target="#t_PIR_1"
                                >PIR</gloss>—formerly called <gloss target="#t_MRII_1"
                            >MRII</gloss>). In approving these funds, the Committee requested a
                            status report every sixty days which would specify the purposes for
                            which these funds were being expended and assess their
                            effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>Since 5 November, a total of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>] has been passed to the three opposition parties
                            and the <gloss target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss>; of this amount, [<hi
                                rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] has been made
                            available to the Christian Democratic Party (<gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss>); [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>] to the National Party (<gloss target="#t_PN_1"
                                >PN</gloss>); [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                            declassified</hi>] to the Democratic Radical Party (<gloss
                                target="#t_PDR_1">PDR</gloss>) and [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount
                                not declassified</hi>] to the <gloss target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss>.
                            Available evidence indicates that the funds passed during November and
                            December 1971 have been employed effectively by the recipients and that
                            they have contributed to the increasing strength and confidence being
                            exhibited by the Chilean opposition.</p>
                        <p>On 15 December the Committee approved an additional [<hi rend="italic"
                                >dollar amount not declassified</hi>] to support opposition
                            candidates in two by-elections which were held on 16 January. This
                            financial assistance was instrumental in enabling both candidates to
                            defeat their <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> rivals; indeed, both the
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PN_1"
                                >PN</gloss> have characterized this support as having been
                            “absolutely indispensable” under the circumstances. Before the voting,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> had said that
                            the elections would indicate the electorate’s acceptance of government
                            policies, and there was a massive commitment of government forces and
                            largesse to the election. <pb n="524" facs="0564" xml:id="pg_524"/>Both
                                <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> and opposition leaders campaigned
                            as if the government’s future were at stake. Since the elections
                            constitute a popular rejection of the government’s political and
                            economic program, the results are likely to provoke sharp debate within
                            the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> on future strategy.</p>

                        <p>Opposition forces, despite a long history of bitter rivalry with each
                            other, have begun to cooperate on endeavors where it is in their common
                            interest and to their mutual advantage in confronting the government on
                            specific political issues. [<hi rend="italic">4 lines not
                                declassified</hi>] For example, in early December, the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss>
                            joined forces in the famous “pots and pans” women’s march episode which
                            came to symbolize in a rather dramatic fashion the increased resistance
                            to the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government. [<hi
                                rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>] Since that time, the
                            two parties joined in organizing a semi-secret women’s organization
                            called “SUN” which conducts telephone and doorbell-ringing campaigns to
                            get women to participate in political activities; the <gloss
                                target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss> sent its supporters to help fill the
                            national stadium in Santiago for a <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                            >PDC</gloss>-sponsored rally on 16 December and also supported the
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> move to impeach Minister of
                            Interior <persName corresp="#p_TGJ_1">Toha</persName>. The <gloss
                                target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>
                            cooperated in organizing an ad-hoc committee to deal with the government
                            when opposition radio stations were closed for a brief period in
                            December as a result of <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>-instigated
                            employees’ demands on management. The <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_PDR_1">PDR</gloss> worked together in Congress on a bill
                            which defines the sectors of the economy, and cooperated very
                            effectively in the by-election campaigns. During this period the
                            government was troubled by serious politico-economic difficulties in the
                            copper mines and also encountered increasing campesino opposition to its
                            agrarian reform program. Tension also remained high at the University of
                            Chile, although violence there has declined as a result of a 4 January
                            1972 agreement providing for the resignation of all university officials
                            on 31 January to be followed by new elections and a university
                            plebiscite on 27 April which had been demanded by opposition forces. The
                            military, disturbed by evidences of political disorder and economic
                            mismanagement, have become increasingly politicized, tending to
                            interpret promotions or shifts within their own ranks in terms of
                            political losses and gains for the government or opposition.</p>
                        <p>Although all these trends appear to favor the opposition—and the
                            by-elections prove that public confidence in the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss> government has declined—the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss> still has the political leverage with which to regain
                            the initiative. On 29–30 December, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> met with leaders and delegates
                            from all the government coalition parties in a special assembly to
                            decide what actions should be taken to regain the momentum the <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> enjoyed until late 1971. A special
                            approach was made to the <gloss target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss>, and on 31
                            December <gloss target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss> Deputy Naudon announced
                            that <pb n="525" facs="0565" xml:id="pg_525"/>the <gloss
                                target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss>, as an independent political entity,
                            would soon join the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>. At the same
                            time, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> was almost

                                >PDC</gloss>. The opposition’s newfound unity is fragile, and the
                            hardening of the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>’s position as an
                            opposition party working closely with the <gloss target="#t_PN_1"
                                >PN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PDR_1">PDR</gloss> created new

                        <p>As a result of the January by-elections, the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss> government is on the defensive for the first time. Voter
                            turnout for a by-election is usually low in comparison with a national
                            election, but in this case the turnout was virtually the same as in the
                            April 1971 municipal elections. In each province approximately 3% of the
                            voters shifted from the government to the opposition, as contrasted with
                            the April results, so that the government can no longer maintain that it
                            represents an electoral majority. The democratic parties, delighted by
                            this victory, have gained new confidence in their ability to obstruct
                            successfully the government’s program to “construct Socialism” in
                            Chile.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">3½ lines not declassified</hi>] All the opposition
                            parties conducted fund-raising campaigns and in fact received quite
                            substantial contributions, but the massive character of government
                            intervention in the campaign necessitated an opposition effort which
                            would have been impossible without U.S. support. In Linares, for
                            example, the government organized and financed the entire Mery campaign,
                            giving away thousands of dollars worth of sewing machines, boxes of food
                            and all kinds of supplies which were brought in by government transport
                            (a <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss> leader estimates that the campaign
                            cost the government $500,000 to $750,000 in Linares alone). <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> paramilitary organizations functioned
                            openly, not only physically harassing the opposition but using violence
                            to intimidate the voters. The systematic campaign of violence and
                            intimidation conducted by the government was so widespread that the
                            large voter turnout and calm atmosphere of election day was almost <pb

                            of the physical presence of army units in the voting centers.</p>
                        <p>The aggressiveness and vigor of the opposition electoral campaigns was
                            possible because new confidence had been engendered by the success of
                            the first organized public efforts to oppose the <persName

                                lines not declassified</hi>] There can be no doubt, however, that
                            the opposition’s success was made possible largely because of the
                            financial aid provided by the U.S. Government, which significantly built
                            up the confidence and capabilities of the parties. No security problems
                            have arisen in connection with any funds passed to date.</p>
                        <p>Funds approved by the Committee for the ongoing support of the opposition
                            parties will continue to be used for the purposes specified in the
                            memorandum approved by the Committee on 5 November. It is impossible to
                            predict what action the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> may decide to
                            take to cope with the political problems which have been intensified by
                            the opposition’s electoral victory, or with the economic crisis which
                            seems certain to be exacerbated by the proposed U.S. approach to Chilean
                            debt renegotiation. Status reports will continue to be submitted every
                            60 days on the progress being made by opposition parties in
                            restructuring themselves for increasing political activity. These
                            reports will also attempt to analyze the various options open to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government and to
                            the opposition parties during this critical period.</p>

                        <p>The overseas training program permits <gloss target="#t_AIFLD_1"
                                >AIFLD</gloss> to maintain a limited U.S.-oriented presence in the

                                target="#t_AIFLD_1">AIFLD</gloss> carefully selects leaders both
                            from opposition and pro-government unions who are willing to participate
                            in the training programs. In addition, US<gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss> and Embassy staff maintain close contacts with the
                                <gloss target="#t_AIFLD_1">AIFLD</gloss> Country Program Director to
                            insure that potential stumbling blocks are avoided. In the last half of
                            CY 1971 eighteen union leaders received training or attended seminars
                            under this program. About 32 leaders are expected to participate in
                            1972. The programs are generally of a short-term nature, averaging about
                            one month in duration.</p>
                        <p>I propose, subject to appropriation levels, that the Embassy/USAID
                            proposal be approved. On December 23, 1970 the Senior Review Group <hi
                                rend="italic">approved inter alia</hi> a recommendation that the
                            A.I.D. Mission in Santiago “... continue those existing activities which
                            have little benefit for the Chilean Government but keep individual
                            Chileans well disposed toward the United States.” An extension of the
                                <gloss target="#t_AIFLD_1">AIFLD</gloss> contract would be
                            consistent with this decision. If at some point this policy were
                            changed, we could terminate the contract by giving <gloss
                                target="#t_AIFLD_1">AIFLD</gloss> thirty days notice. (As an

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJH_1">Crimmins</persName> asked for a run-down
                            of how we stood on our current disbursements in Chile. [<hi
                                rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] briefly reviewed these,
                            noting that some [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>]
                            of the [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>]
                            authorized by the Committee in November for general opposition activity
                            had been disbursed, and that all of the [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount
                                not declassified</hi>] authorized for the two January by-elections
                            had all been used.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJH_1">Crimmins</persName> then asked if we
                            were in danger of overploughing the ground, if we were not running the
                            risk, in other words, of putting in money in sufficient quantities to
                            arouse the suspicions of the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> Government. [<hi rend="italic">name not
                                declassified</hi>] said the Agency was sensitive to this problem,
                            but that in fact the situation was better now than it had been. The
                            growing confidence of the opposition, coupled with the successes it had
                            won in the January by-elections, could be assumed to bring out money for
                            the opposition that hitherto had been “kept in mattresses”; such an
                            assumption, whether justified or not, could cover the introduction of
                            considerable amounts.</p>
                        <p>Introducing a new subject, [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]
                            surmised that if debt renegotiations with Chile did not go well from
                            that country’s point of view we might expect a vigorous Chilean
                            propaganda campaign against the United States. Should we perhaps now
                            start preparing, or even pushing, a propaganda campaign of our own to
                                fore<pb n="532" facs="0572" xml:id="pg_532"/>stall such a
                            development? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJH_1">Crimmins</persName> said
                            this deserved thought, but we should be careful lest moving onto the
                            offensive here would create the very problem we were hoping to correct.
                            The consensus was that we leave this one for the future.</p>

                            million dollars a day. Now, the same with Chile: If the Soviet, the
                            Russians, have to support them, then they will have to be supported by
                            the Russians. The way that Chile—if they want more support from us, they
                            must come a long way. That—we won’t tell them that but they will know

                            handsome there, and they destroyed Argentina for a quarter of a

                        <p>1. The Agency involvement in large-scale political action programs in
                            Chile began with the 1964 presidential elections in response to the
                            threat posed by the Communist-dominated Popular Action Front (<gloss
                                target="#t_FRAP_1">FRAP</gloss>) supporting <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Salvador Allende</persName>. Preparations for the
                            1964 campaign had begun more than two years earlier during the
                            administration of President <persName corresp="#p_KRT_1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> when the Special Group on 19 April 1962 approved
                            an expenditure of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                            declassified</hi>] to support the left-of-center Christian Democratic
                            Party (<gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>) in order to build it up as
                            a democratic alternative to the <gloss target="#t_FRAP_1">FRAP</gloss>
                            coalition.</p>
                        <p>2. Initially, it appeared that the presidential candidate would be
                            Senator Julio Duran who was backed by a coalition of centrist and
                            rightist parties known as the Democratic Front. By March 1964,
                            by-election results and polls indicated that the Democratic Front was in
                            a state of disarray and that Duran had no chance of winning the
                            presidency. As a result, a new program for [<hi rend="italic">dollar
                                amount not declassified</hi>] was approved by the Special Group on
                            14 May 1964 to support Christian Democratic presidential candidate
                                <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Eduardo Frei</persName>. An additional
                                [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] for the
                            Chilean elections was approved by the Special Group on 21 July 1964.</p>
                        <p>3. Election day, 4 September 1964, produced an overwhelming victory for
                            Frei who won 56.1 percent of the valid votes cast, as against 38.9
                            percent for <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. Duran, [<hi
                                rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>], received the remaining
                            five percent of the votes.</p>
                        <p>4. The September 1970 presidential elections were preceded by many months
                            of intensive politicking to determine who the candidates would be. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ARJ_1">Jorge Alessandri</persName> quickly
                            emerged as the candidate of the Right, as did Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRR_1">Radomiro Tomic</persName> for the Christian
                            Democrats. By early 1970, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> again emerged as the candidate of the Popular
                            Unity forces. In March to June 1970, the 40 Committee approved [<hi
                                rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] for the Agency to
                            initiate a propaganda program <pb n="535" facs="0575" xml:id="pg_535"
                            />alerting the Chilean people to the dangers of a Marxist Government
                            under <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. The 40 Committee
                            excluded support to either of the candidates opposing Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>.</p>
                        <p>5. It was in this period and context that, at the suggestion of Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MJ_1">John McCone</persName>, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> held his two discussions with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GHS_1">Harold S. Geneen</persName>, Chairman
                            and President of <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss>, on 16 and 27 July
                            1970. At the same time the Chief of Station, Santiago had just been
                            contacted by [<hi rend="italic">3 lines not declassified</hi>]. At the
                            first meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> turned
                            down a request by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GHS_1">Geneen</persName> to
                            have <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> channel “substantial” private
                            business funds to Alessandri and made it clear that the U.S. Government
                            was not supporting any candidates. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1"
                                >Broe</persName> did agree that, after consulting with Station
                            Santiago he would advise Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GHS_1"
                                >Geneen</persName> on how <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> might
                            best go about this on its own. His check with the <gloss
                                target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>, Santiago indicated that [<hi
                                rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] with the advice of the
                                <gloss target="#t_COS_1">COS</gloss>, Santiago was already in
                            contact [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] and
                            had set up a secure funding channel. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1"
                                >Broe</persName> so notified Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GHS_1"
                                >Geneen</persName> in their 27 July discussion.</p>
                        <p>6. The Chilean people went to the polls on 4 September 1970; and
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> came out with a
                            slight plurality (36.3%) over Alessandri (34.9%). On 24 October, the
                            Congress was to choose the President from among these two front-runners;
                            and, traditionally, the Congressional choice had been the individual
                            with the highest popular vote. The prospect of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> as President had caused some
                            economic disruption and coup rumors were abounding. Thus, in late
                            September (29 September), the 40 Committee agreed that strong efforts
                            should be made to add to the economic pressures in Chile [<hi
                                rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>]. It was hoped that
                            economic deterioration might have some effect on the Congressional
                            presidential vote by persuading a sufficient number of Christian
                            Democrats to vote against <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>.</p>
                        <p>7. [<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (15½ lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>8. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> was elected by
                            Congress on 24 October and was inaugurated within two weeks as President
                            of Chile. In late October and November 1970, this new situation was
                            recognized by 40 Committee authorizations amounting to [<hi
                                rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] for support of
                            opposition newspapers and radio stations. On 28 January 1971, the 40
                            Committee authorized [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>] for support of the three opposition parties in
                            the impending April 1971 municipal elections as well as further aid to
                            the radio stations, newspapers and propaganda activities of the three
                            opposition parties. Subsequent 40 Committee authorizations in the period
                            March through December 1971 and totaling [<hi rend="italic">dollar
                                amount not declassified</hi>] provided opposition funding for [<hi
                                rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] Congressional
                            by-elections, [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>] and the
                            continuance of a wide spectrum of organizational type support for the
                            opposition parties. The op<pb n="536" facs="0576" xml:id="pg_536"
                            />position almost split the vote evenly with the Government in the April
                            municipal elections and won all seats disputed in the two Congressional
                            by-elections. Today, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            finds himself in serious economic trouble while facing an increasingly
                            confident and aggressive opposition.</p>
                        <p>9. Over the past year, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName>
                            has had five luncheon meetings with [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                                not declassified</hi>] in charge of the [<hi rend="italic">less than
                                1 line not declassified</hi>] office. All of these contacts have
                            been at the initiative of [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]
                            who had been instructed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GHS_1"
                                >Geneen</persName> to stay in contact. Discussions at these
                            luncheons did not involve any Chilean proposals but were devoted mainly
                            to the general situation in Latin America at that time. Contact with
                                <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> has also been maintained
                            through a Headquarters officer, [<hi rend="italic">5 lines not

                        <p>10. Some of the questions it is anticipated might be raised with the
                                <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss> along with suggested answers
                            are the following:</p>
                        <p>a. What is the relationship of the <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss>
                            with the Agency regarding Chile?</p>
                        <p>—ITT contacted the Agency in July 1970 and indicated that it wished to
                            put a fairly substantial amount of funds into the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> opposition camp during the
                            presidential election campaign.</p>
                        <p>—ITT wanted us to handle the funds for them but we refused. The Agency
                            was precluded from supporting any candidate in the election.</p>
                        <p>—We did, however, advise <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> concerning

                        <p>—I don’t know.</p>
                        <p>c. Was <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">William V. Broe</persName>, an Agency
                            employee, in contact with <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> as
                            reported?</p>
                        <p>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> was formerly the Chief
                            of the Latin American Division of the Clandestine Service and is now the
                            Inspector General of the Agency.</p>
                        <p>—[<hi rend="italic">5½ lines not declassified</hi>] The purpose of this
                            policy in that particular situation was to try to persuade the Chilean
                            Congress not to select <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            as president. Because none of the candidates had a majority of the
                            popular vote, the Chilean Congress was to choose between the two leading
                            candidates, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Salvador Allende</persName>
                            (36.3%) and <persName corresp="#p_ARJ_1">

                            </persName> (34.9%). The U.S. business community with interests in Chile
                            was viewed as an important part of this program, [<hi rend="italic">1½

                        <p>d. When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> saw [<hi

                            he acting under instructions from you?</p>
                        <p>—Yes. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> indeed was
                            instructed to see [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] with a

                            extent of its capability and willingness to intensify the economic
                            problems already becoming apparent there.</p>
                        <p>e. Did Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> continue these
                            contacts after <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> was
                            inaugurated?</p>
                        <p>—Yes, on a sporadic basis, but they consisted of general discussions
                            about the Latin American situation and did not cover any specific
                            proposals or activities regarding Chile or any other country for that
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>f. Has the Agency had any other contacts other than Mr. <persName

                        <p>—An Agency representative in Latin America did discuss the security of
                            the <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> funding program during the 1970
                            presidential elections with <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss>
                            representatives. This, as I noted before, was in order to avoid taking
                            chances on giving <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> an
                            exploitable issue during the campaign. [<hi rend="italic">10½ lines not

                        <p>g. Did in fact <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> consider triggering a coup by economic
                            pressures or other means?</p>
                        <p>—Coup talk abounded amongst the Chileans in the period between <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s plurality at the polls (4
                            September) and his election by Congress (24 October) and his
                            inauguration (3 November). Our intelligence indicated this was a quite
                            remote possibility despite all the discussion about it. It was also
                            clear from our reporting that Frei and all the major military leaders
                            were very much opposed to any abrogation of the constitutional
                            process.</p>
                        <p>—The major U.S. objective in generating economic pressures at the time
                            was to have <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> enter office
                            by as narrow a vote in the formal Congressional elections as possible;
                            then neither he nor his constituency would think he had a strong enough
                            mandate to move quickly on a number of key Marxist measures which would,
                            as he had promised, make Socialism irreversible in Chile. Instead, in
                            political terms, he would have to feel his way along cautiously.</p>
                        <p>—In the end, we were counting on the fact that the economic results of
                            his actions (raising wages, nationalizations, inflation, flight of
                            capital, etc.) would eventually take their economic toll and catch up
                            with him, and this is pretty much what has happened in the last year and
                            a half. Ultimately, we expected this would cause him to lose some of his
                            fringe political support and render him incapable of pursuing his
                            Marxist goals.</p>
                        <p>—In short, we thought his economic policy would be his ultimate undoing
                            and that a coup was not feasible at all.</p>
                        <p>h. Did the Agency make approaches to members of the Armed Forces in an
                            attempt to provoke an armed uprising?</p>
                        <p>—No, we were <pb n="538" facs="0578" xml:id="pg_538"/>in contact for
                            intelligence gathering purposes only—as we are expected to be. It was
                            clear, despite the loose coup talk around, that the Chilean military
                            were constitutionally oriented. [<hi rend="italic">name not
                                declassified</hi>] did talk coup to three key Chilean military

                        <p>i. Did the Agency have contact with General <persName corresp="#p_VMR_1"
                                >Viaux</persName> or offer him material assistance and support?</p>
                        <p>—No, but we were watching him closely through intelligence sources. He
                            had tried, unsuccessfully, to instigate a coup in October 1969 from
                            Tacna, a garrison town in the interior of Chile. He was retired shortly
                            after that and, at the time of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s election a year later, he was on the outside
                            and did not have appeal to the active duty military. (In fact, we were
                            in contact with some of his supporters trying to foment a coup, but this
                            was done through case officers under third national cover.)</p>
                        <p>j. Was <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> involved in any way in
                            General <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName>’s
                            assassination?</p>

                        <p>k. What, if anything, did the Agency do during the 1970 election
                            campaign?</p>
                        <p>—The Agency spent [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>]
                            over a period of six months during the pre-election period on propaganda
                            activities to emphasize the dangers of Marxism to Chile. This campaign
                            included media placements in both radio and publications and
                            underwriting numerous leaflets and posters. I want to emphasize that no
                            money was given by the Agency or the U.S. Government to any candidate.
                            This program was approved by the 40 Committee.</p>

                            both Chile and the rest of the Hemisphere, and we have been supporting
                            the opposition in a variety of ways. (This includes support to parties,

                        </list>
                        <p>During the year and a half under the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> government, the Chilean tradition of
                            accommodative politics has survived, despite rising pressures to by-pass
                            the constitutional system through coercion and confrontation. The
                            strength and resiliency of the Chilean political system is seen in the
                            willingness of most of the chief political actors to turn to
                            conciliation and compromise to defuse potentially explosive situations,
                            rather than let the advocates of political violence carry the day. This
                            memorandum assesses recent Chilean developments which, taken together,
                            seem to tilt the odds away from conciliation and towards confrontation.
                            We still believe that the system of accommodation will persevere over
                            the next year or so. But the strains are becoming much greater and the
                            political polarization more obvious, and we are less confident than
                            before that the professional politicians will be able to put together
                            compromises and make them stick. Thus the odds on a rupture or major
                            alteration of the Chilean constitutional tradition are rising.</p>

                            up. Government and opposition leaders alike glibly refer to a threat of
                            civil war and there is much talk about a “fascist” conspiracy on one
                            side and a “Stalinist” spectre on the other. Illegal armed groups
                            representing the extreme left and far right are becoming more active in
                            the countryside. In addition to the illegal land seizures by groups
                            identified with the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (<gloss
                                target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss>), there are now reports of armed
                            landowners (some dubbed “White Guards”) reclaiming seized properties.
                            There are signs that the military is becoming increasingly concerned and
                            restive, with rightist politicians stepping up efforts to interest them
                            in a coup. In the face of the rising political heat, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has alluded darkly to the fate
                            of reformist President Balmaceda whose conflict with Congress led to a
                            civil war, his overthrow, and his suicide in 1891. Government spokesmen
                            have even recalled the liquidation of the left in Indonesia in
                            attempting to dramatize the danger of counterrevolution. At the same
                            time economic problems are mounting and add still one more set of
                            pressures to the political arena. Shortages persist and the rate of
                            inflation is rising.</p>
                        <p>2. If one were to take literally the inflammatory rhetoric of Chilean
                            politicians, it might easily be concluded that Chile today resembles
                            Spain on the eve of its Civil War. While there may be some parallels,
                            there are important differences. In Chile, the traditional rules of the
                            political game are still in force. At the same time that the main actors
                            engage in verbal brinksmanship publicly on supposedly non-negotiable
                            positions, some of them meet privately to try for compromise solutions.
                            Recently, when the opposition-dominated Congress passed a constitutional
                            amendment restricting the President’s power to nationalize private
                            businesses, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> threatened
                            to veto key portions, and claimed that a two-thirds vote of the Congress
                            would be necessary to override the veto. The opposition denied this,
                            stating that an absolute majority would be sufficient to override, after
                            which <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s only recourse
                            would be to call a plebiscite to decide the issue. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, unwilling to test his
                            popularity in a referendum at this time, maintained that the entire
                            question would be decided by the Constitutional Tribunal. The opposition
                            countered that the problem was outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Amid
                            suggestions from both sides that the conflict could trigger a civil war,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> entered into talks
                            with the Christian Democrats to reach a compromise. The immediate
                            impasse and the violent rhetoric continue, but so do efforts for a
                            compromise agreement.</p>
                        <p>3. This Chilean peculiarity of striving for political accommodation is
                            one of the striking differences between Chile now and Spain in the early
                            1930s. In the highly charged atmosphere prevailing, the willingness of
                            seemingly implacable political foes to engage in behind-the-scenes
                            bargaining is a crucial element in preserving the essentially <pb
                                n="541" facs="0581" xml:id="pg_541"/>democratic character of the
                            existing Chilean political system. The relative ease with which Chilean
                            politicians are able to retreat and compromise when violent
                            confrontation appears imminent is in part indicative of a shared stake
                            in the perpetuation of the existing system by leaders of various and
                            antagonistic political persuasions. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> himself and the men who now lead the major
                            Chilean political parties are successful products of this system who at
                            one time or another have savored the fruits of power. They are skilled
                            practitioners of the occult political arts. Practically all have served
                            or are serving in the Chilean Senate, a body which places a premium on
                            cloakroom conciliation and compromise, notwithstanding the vitriolic
                            debate on the floor.</p>
                        <p>4. Yet this “political transactionalism”, as it has been called, faces an
                            uncertain future in Chile. Extremists of the left and right perceive
                            little advantage in perpetuating the existing system, and increasingly
                            appear to be spoiling for what they hope will be a decisive armed
                            confrontation that settles the issue of Chile’s political future their
                            way. Moreover, while it is difficult to gauge the extent to which the
                            Chilean public is influenced by repeated allegations of sedition,
                            impending civil war, etc., these charges may speed the process of
                            polarization to the point where it would be difficult to check or
                            reverse. Indeed, there is the danger that the politicians are becoming
                            captives of their own rhetoric, fearful that their opponents in fact are
                            out to annihilate them politically and have few compunctions about
                            destroying Chile’s democratic institutions in the process. The usual
                            Chilean political horsetrading would in time become all but impossible
                            under such circumstances.</p>
                        <p>5. One of the great uncertainties is how much and how fast the attitude
                            of the military may be changing. Reports are accumulating of military
                            officers professing a willingness to intervene when “the time is ripe”.
                            Although they are vague on the question of how and when this condition
                            will be fulfilled, the most likely circumstance would be an actual or
                            threatened breakdown of public order. The conservative National Party
                            and possibly some Christian Democrats may already favor a coup, but the
                            military would probably be reluctant to assume responsibility for an
                            unconstitutional change of government unless it perceived that a broad
                            range of Chilean public opinion favored such an outcome. Clearly, this
                            is not yet the case. The revelations of Jack Anderson are bound to exert
                            some inhibitory effect on the plans of military and civilian plotters,
                            if only because any move against the regime now would be associated in
                            the public mind with US machinations. On the other hand, if the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government and
                            especially the leftist extremists move too quickly and crudely to take
                            advantage of this issue—i.e., by a broad crackdown on opposition
                            groups—disgruntled military and civilian elements may be forced to move
                            in self defense.</p>
                        <p>6. For a number of reasons, a direct military seizure of power does not
                            seem to be the most likely outcome even if a major crisis were to force
                            the military’s hand. Like most <pb n="542" facs="0582" xml:id="pg_542"
                            />Chileans, military men generally take great pride in the national
                            heritage of respect for legality and constitutional order. And unlike
                            many other Latin American military establishments, the Chilean armed
                            forces take their role to be servants rather than arbiters of the
                            national constitution. Consequently the military would not relish
                            forcing <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> out of office
                            except in circumstances which appeared to allow no other acceptable
                            solution. A more likely military response in a crisis would be an effort
                            to exert heavy pressure on <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> to force changes in personnel and policies, to
                            defuse the crisis and foster a return to order. While the constitution
                            technically would remain inviolate, even this level of military
                            intervention would represent a sharp break with Chilean political
                            practice.</p>
                        <p>7. If there were widespread violence and the government appeared unable
                            or unwilling to restore order, one could thus envisage a military
                            ultimatum to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> which at a
                            minimum would demand <hi rend="italic">carte blanche</hi> to
                            re-establish peace. In such circumstances, the odds are that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> (backed in particular by the
                            Communist Party which has long had a phobia about the threat of a
                            military coup) would yield to military demands. This would probably
                            involve allowing the military and the Carabineros to crack down on those
                            leftist extremists who would not accept the curbing of their revolution
                            (including some in <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s own
                            Socialist Party). But <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            would perceive that he had little choice if he wished to remain in
                            office and consolidate the considerable gains already made. Once some
                            semblance of order was reinstituted the military would be in a good
                            position to demand a major continuing voice in policy on the grounds
                            that a renewal of large-scale violence had to be averted.</p>
                        <p>8. A development that could foreclose the possibility of effective
                            military intervention would be the emergence of a deep division within
                            the Chilean military itself. If concurrent with escalating violent
                            encounters between pro- and anti-<persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> forces, the military is riven by the same kind
                            of conflict that divides the populace as a whole, the consequence could
                            be military inaction. If this occurred, the prospect of civil war would
                            loom larger. We would estimate that the likelihood in the immediate
                            future of either a fullscale civil war, or of a military seizure of
                            power, is quite low. The odds that the military will assume an important
                            political role sometime over the next year or so is of a distinctly
                            higher order of magnitude. In fact, growing numbers of professional
                            politicians, in as well as out of the government, may come to welcome
                            some form of military intervention to save the system from what they
                            would perceive as a worse disaster—such as civil war.</p>
                        <p>9. If obliged at this point in time to make a prediction, we would still
                            say that the Chilean proclivity for avoiding the brink is likely to
                            prevent an early breakdown or major alteration of the political system.
                                <pb n="543" facs="0583" xml:id="pg_543"/>But we nonetheless
                            recognize that the resort to political violence and inflammatory
                            rhetoric is rising and the strength of the constitutional system is
                            eroding—processes which cannot continue indefinitely without dramatic
                            consequences. Thus we would conclude that the chances of the present
                            constitutional arrangement surviving intact over the next several years
                            are poor.</p>

                            regime and to limit the ability of the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> regime to carry out policies contrary to United
                            States and hemisphere interests. To achieve these objectives, we seek to
                            maximize pressure on the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            Government while maintaining a correct but cool posture. Thus, pressure
                            is to be balanced by a restrained posture so that measures intended to
                            prevent consolidation of the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> regime do not in fact contribute to its
                            consolidation of power or its ability to rally support. Our policy on
                            Chile has proven reasonably successful to date and has been so
                            acknowledged by our friends in Chile and elsewhere in the world. The
                            unvarying advice we continue to receive from <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s opponents and those who wish
                            us well is to continue on the course we have taken. The publication of
                            the Anderson–ITT documents has been, however, a setback to the policy
                            and a corresponding gain for <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>.</p>

                        <p>Though hard-pressed, the basic elements of democratic choice are still
                            intact in Chile. The outcome of the political struggle is still
                            uncertain and <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            revolution has not reached the point of irreversibility.</p>
                        <p>The following sections discuss current and projected developments,
                            internal and external, and conclude with a discussion of questions
                            relating to debt rescheduling which require most immediate decision.
                            With respect to other aspects of our relations with Chile, the options
                            as stated in the paper submitted to the Senior Review Group on Next
                            Steps in Chile on November 23, 1971 continue to stand.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Political</hi>—In the first few months following his
                            accession to power, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            enjoyed the “honeymoon” traditionally accorded a new administration in
                            Chile. The opposition managed to block or divert certain governmental
                            legislative initiatives, but for the most part the administration built
                            up considerable momentum as it went about implementing its program at a
                            rapid rate. The April 1971 municipal elections, which showed a sharp
                            rise in the vote polled by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s Socialist Party (12% to 22%), was the
                            culmination of that period.</p>
                        <p>The opposition, nevertheless, held the Popular Unity government just
                            short of a majority in those elections, and since then the government’s
                            popularity has steadily slipped. Anti-government manifestations
                            accompanied worsening economic problems, particularly shortages of food
                            and other consumer items, and by last September political polarization
                            began to acquire a momentum of its own. As measured by the results in
                            congressional by-elections, the opposition margin over the government
                            coalition increased from a slight majority in Valparaiso Province in
                            July 1971 to a substantial one in three other provinces in January
                            1972.</p>
                        <p>It is far from certain that the pattern will hold through the future.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> as Chief Executive
                            enjoys a broad range of constitutional powers which he is clearly
                            prepared to utilize to the utmost. His political support has receded
                            measurably from its inflated display of last April, but he has not lost
                            his political skill. The coalition which supports him has been strained
                            by the internal recriminations which have followed the January electoral
                            setback, but it shows no sign of coming apart prior to the March 1973
                            congressional elections. Were it to gain a majority in the Congress in
                            those elections, there would be virtually no impediment to the
                            definitive restructuring of Chile sought by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> and his supporters, for they would be able to
                            accomplish it legally. By the time of the presidential election in 1976,
                            the opposition parties would most likely have found organization,
                            financing, and mass communications so difficult as to make their chances
                            of winning that election, no matter how honestly held, virtually
                            nil.</p>
                        <pb n="545" facs="0585" xml:id="pg_545"/>
                        <p>Up to now, however, it has been more probable that the opposition would
                            retain its control of the Congress in the March 1973 elections. The
                            political polarization already occurring, the poor economic prospects,
                            the continued independence of the military, and the disposition to
                            cooperate of the two major opposition parties, the Christian Democrats
                            and the Nationals, formed the basis for this judgment. The publication
                            of the Anderson–ITT papers has been, however, a windfall for <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> at a critical moment for him.
                            This development is certain to assist him politically to a degree not
                            yet possible to assess. It will serve to heighten credence among
                            moderates in habitual leftist charges of foreign plotting against Chile.
                            It will leave a taint on some oppositionists, thus undercutting their
                            effectiveness. It can drive the Chilean military further into its
                            constitutionalist shell. (See Annex A for Santiago telegram 1536, April
                            1, 1972, giving Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DN_1">Davis</persName>’
                            current assessment on debt renegotiation and the Anderson–ITT

                            <hi rend="italic">Economic</hi>—During 1971 the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> increased the purchasing power of lower-income sectors
                            by about 40%, stimulating consumer-goods industries and reducing
                            unemployment. While it claimed to hold price inflation at around 22%,
                            moderate for Chile, and to have increased GNP for the year by 8% with
                            unemployment at only about 3.5%, these momentary accomplishments will
                            exact a severe economic and political price in 1972. The doubling of the
                            money supply and stimulation of demand for consumption items has
                            produced pent-up inflationary forces of major proportions. The
                            anti-private enterprise policies of the regime resulted in net
                            disinvestment in 1971 in this sector. Bad management and worker
                            performance in much of the public sector, especially copper, left
                            foreign exchange earnings well below goals. Accelerated expropriation of
                            farms, much of it carried out by extreme leftist factions out of the
                            government’s control, dislocated agricultural production and left
                            requirements for heavy food imports this year. All together, the outlook
                            for the Chilean economy in 1972 is so bleak that no likely combination
                            of debt relief, new credits or default will avert serious economic
                            problems. (See Annex B for Embassy Santiago telegram 1466, March 28,
                            1972, Review of Chilean Economy.)</p>
                        <p>The implications in the economic sphere for U.S. strategy with regard to
                            Chile are virtually the same as, and intimately connected with, those in
                            the political sphere. As Embassy Santiago pointed out in a recent
                            telegram—transmitted, it should be noted, before the publication of the
                            Anderson–ITT memoranda—“Economics will largely determine politics during
                            months to come,” and “The odds in favor of an opposition victory in 1973
                            are steadily improving, and will probably continue to do so as long as
                            the process unfolds normally and <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"

                            Government and have begun to make available some economic assistance.
                            The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has raised to $97 million a
                            vague and unused offer of $57 million in credits left over from the Frei

                            industrial development projects. It has, in addition, opened a $37

                            said to be freely convertible and without strings. There are unconfirmed

                            dangling a $300 million offer of credits to the Chilean military for

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> has furnished a five-year $65

                                >GOC</gloss> officials have claimed a total of nearly $400 million
                            in new credits from the socialist countries (our own count is closer to
                            $250 million), but it is clear that a large part of this is in supplier
                            credits of doubtful economic value or in project financing for which
                            plans are still in drawing-board stages at best.</p>
                        <p>We believe, however, that if the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"

                            In any event, it would complicate his relations with neighboring

                                >GOC</gloss> would all prefer to avoid. We estimate that the <gloss

                                >PRC</gloss> would also prefer to limit Chilean demands on their

                            cautious about increasing their involvement and presence unless

                            The <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>’s relatively limited resources

                            carefully kept a fairly low silhouette on the Chilean scene, both in the

                            international conferences, including <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD_1"
                                >UNCTAD</gloss> III in Santiago in April, will provide him with a
                            platform and setting suited to his aims. He can be expected to make a
                            major effort to win international sympathy and support in the Third
                            World and beyond for Chile as a leader of underdeveloped countries in
                            their struggle to obtain better treatment by the developed countries,
                            led by the United States. As a part of this effort, he will undoubtedly
                            exploit the <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> memoranda and our
                            current position in the Paris talks.</p>
                        <p>While so far there has been no known direct <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> support for subversives against other neighboring
                            countries, some extra-legal support, principally from the Socialist
                            Party, has already been given, and aid to subversives from <persName

                            almost certainly transit through Chile.</p>
                        <p>The Chilean experiment, combining independence from U.S. influence with
                            sweeping social change carried out with a show of legalistic deference
                            to pluralism, has inherent appeal in Latin America. The extent to which
                            this appeal is manifested in political developments in other countries
                            will depend on the evident success or failure of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime, and whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> can persuasively attribute his
                            difficulties to external factors. The implications for U.S. strategy are
                            clear.</p>
                        <p>In sum, the course of political and economic developments in Chile has
                            been in the direction we desire in dealing with the Chilean problem.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has problems, but so
                            far he has remained unable to escape the political and economic damage
                            of these problems by credibly transferring the blame for them from
                            himself to us. The <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> memoranda
                            represent the first significant opportunity for him to rally support by
                            using the United States as an alibi.</p>
                        <p>These trends confirm the general correctness of our established policy,
                            namely maximizing pressure on the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> government within a cool but correct framework
                            which ensures that measures intended to prevent the consolidation of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime do not in
                            fact contribute to that consolidation or the regime’s ability to rally

                        <p>The basic issue in our relations with Chile on which <gloss
                                target="#t_SRG_1">SRG</gloss> guidance is required now is the
                            question of whether it is in our interest to sign a multilateral debt
                            rescheduling agreement for Chile this year. The principal determinants
                            of this decision are:</p>
                        <p>(1) its effects on <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            political and economic prospects; and</p>
                        <p>(2) certain basic tenets of U.S. foreign economic policy.</p>
                        <pb n="548" facs="0588" xml:id="pg_548"/>
                        <p>With regard to (1), our principal political objectives are:</p>
                        <p>a) to assure that the effects of a debt renegotiation will be of minimum
                            assistance to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> in solving
                            his economic problems, both with respect to the amount of debt relief
                            and the flow of new credits;</p>
                        <p>b) to avoid being made a scapegoat for <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s current economic difficulties in a manner
                            which would help consolidate his regime.</p>
                        <p>We need to determine whether these objectives can best be achieved by a)
                            signing a multilateral debt rescheduling agreement or b) not signing and
                            having other creditors reach agreement without us. We do not believe
                            other creditors can be prevented from eventually proceeding to a
                            separate agreement if we decide not to sign.</p>
                        <p>With regard to (2), the economic issues of fundamental importance to the
                            US are: 1) that debts not be repudiated, selectively or otherwise; 2)
                            that provision be made for prompt, adequate and effective compensation
                            for expropriated investment; and 3) that immediate <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> interests represented by Chilean
                            obligations affecting ExImBank, <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>,
                                <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss>, and other <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> agencies, (totaling over $1.1 billion)
                            be protected.</p>
                        <p>The political and economic determinants are, of course, interrelated. The
                            outcome of the debt rescheduling negotiations which would probably be of
                            most political and economic benefit to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> would be one in which the U.S. refuses to
                            reschedule while all other creditors agree to reschedule. This outcome
                            would be credible evidence of U.S. “persecution” of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government which he could use
                            (1) to rally domestic and international support, and (2) to explain away
                            the economic problems he has created for himself. This outcome could
                            also leave <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> better off
                            economically if the damage to Chile’s credit-worthiness resulting from
                            continuing default on obligations to the United States were mitigated.
                            This could result from a readiness by some of the other creditors (and
                            possibly United States banks) to provide enough new credits in addition
                            to the relief obtained by continued default on the U.S. Government debt
                            (an average of $80 million per year in the next three years), so that
                            net capital inflows would be maintained at 1970 levels.<note n="2"

                        </p>
                        <p>This outcome would be most damaging to U.S. interests. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s hold on Chile would be
                            strengthened. There would be great sympathy for him both in Chile and in
                            the rest of the world. Economic pressures on him would be somewhat
                            lessened. Closer relationships between Chile and the socialist countries
                            would be encouraged. And U.S. public institutions could lose $1.1
                            billion.</p>
                        <pb n="549" facs="0589" xml:id="pg_549"/>
                        <p>If a multilateral agreement is reached on a basis acceptable to the U.S.,
                            we would still not be bound to implement the agreement by signing a
                            bilateral accord with the Chileans. This decision could be taken later
                            in bilateral negotiations with the Chileans.</p>
                        <p>The extent to which we achieve our objectives depends in part upon the
                            willingness of other creditors to support us. After three meetings of
                            the Paris Club, it has been increasingly clear that other creditors are
                            anxious to terminate the debt default and encourage resumption of
                            payments by Chile. Some of them are concerned that inflexibility on key
                            issues may lead to a break in the talks, continuing default, and Chilean
                            dependence upon Socialist countries.</p>
                        <p>The other creditors are therefore more prone to accommodate Chile being
                            less concerned with the establishment of undesirable precedents. We
                            believe there is a serious danger that the other creditors may be
                            prepared to settle with Chile at the next meeting (April 17–18) provided
                            that Chile accepts harder terms than it has offered to date, but without
                            giving the U.S. meaningful support on debt and compensation
                                clauses.<note n="3" xml:id="d106fn3">Footnote. Treasury dissents;
                                see page 14 for its views. [Footnote is in the original.]</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>We expect the other creditors will be willing to insert clauses in the
                            multilateral agreement relating to debt repudiation and compensation for
                            expropriated copper interests of U.S. companies, but these clauses are
                            not likely to provide firm assurance that <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss>-guaranteed debt or adequate compensation will be
                                paid.<note n="4" xml:id="d106fn4">Same. [Footnote is in the
                                original.]</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>If properly drafted, however, such clauses could support the principles
                            we are concerned about, calling upon Chile to engage in a meaningful
                            process, e.g., negotiation or arbitration, looking towards discharge of
                            its obligations and opening the way for further consideration of Chile’s
                            performance in future debt rescheduling negotiations. A properly drafted
                            clause could also provide a basis for U.S. refusal to sign a bilateral
                            debt rescheduling agreement, and for a U.S. position in the I.F.I.’s, if
                            Chile does not perform.</p>
                        <p>With regard to terms, we expect the creditors may move further toward the
                            Chileans in the interest of reaching agreement. The creditors at present
                            want a one year consolidation period with relief limited to 70–75% of
                            principal, a grace period of two years and repayment over 5–6 additional
                            years with interest at commercial rates. The Chileans want a three year
                            consolidation period with relief covering 85% of principal <hi
                                rend="italic">and interest</hi>, a grace period of three years and
                            repayment over seven additional years with interest at four per
                            cent.</p>
                        <pb n="550" facs="0590" xml:id="pg_550"/>
                        <p>The United States has strong tactical interest in holding the
                            consolidation period to a single year, so that any subsequent
                            consideration of additional debt relief can be made contingent upon
                            adequate performance under the debt and compensation clauses.</p>
                        <p>There is no further hope that an <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>
                            standby can be obtained. The creditors have pressed for alternative
                            commitments which are more demanding than the Chileans have offered.
                            While the Chileans, with <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> technical
                            assistance, are considering ways to strengthen the measures they offered
                            as an alternative, it is unlikely that the next version will be
                            significantly closer to a standby, particularly with respect to internal
                            policies. However, after three meetings, the creditors are becoming
                            impatient to reach a conclusion, and will probably concede this issue
                            but may use that concession to bargain on terms.</p>
                        <p>The basic decision before us is whether we will sign a multilateral
                            agreement which falls short of our aspirations with respect to the
                            copper debt and equity issues. Based on trends in the Paris meetings to
                            date, there is a high probability that the other creditors would proceed
                            to sign such an agreement without us. Our negotiators would in any event
                            make every effort to secure agreement on the options most beneficial to
                            our interests. Decisions on two specific issues are needed at this
                            time:</p>
                        <p>1. Repayment of the debts of nationalized American companies.</p>
                        <p>2. Provision for just compensation for the value of expropriated United
                            States companies.</p>
                        <p>During the negotiations in Paris we are almost certain to encounter
                            suggestions that we accept relative success on one of these issues in
                            exchange for our ceding on the other or on the terms of
                            rescheduling.</p>

                            <hi rend="roman">1.</hi> The Debt Issue</p>
                        <p>The issue here relates to the unilateral repudiation of contractual
                            obligations undertaken by a sovereign government to its creditors. The
                            Chileans have passed a constitutional amendment which—</p>
                        <p>a) allows the President of Chile to determine that the copper loans will
                            not be repaid if a finding is made that they were not “usefully
                            invested.” (<persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has ruled

                            that a positive compensation award is made to the company. (<persName

                        <p>The Chilean repudiation of debt is one issue on which most other
                            creditors share much of our concern. This issue is complicated, however,
                            by the different manner in which the Chileans are treating the <pb
                                n="551" facs="0591" xml:id="pg_551"/>debts owed to the two American
                            companies: the constitutional process is completed in the case of the
                            Braden debt but not for the Anaconda debt. Both of these debts should
                            receive equal treatment.</p>
                        <p>There are basically three options:</p>
                        <p>1. Require the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> to acknowledge its
                            obligation to pay in full all its debts, specifically including the $8.1
                            million debt to Braden and the outstanding promissory notes to
                            Anaconda.</p>
                        <p>2. Require the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> to acknowledge its
                            obligation to pay in full all its debts; however, in the event that
                            differences exist after the internal process in Chile has been finished,
                            both parties agree to submit immediately to binding arbitration under
                            international law, to be completed within a reasonable time period.</p>
                        <p>3. Require that the agreement include a clause clearly recognizing the
                            obligation under international law to honor debts, and a clause calling
                            upon Chile to meet these obligations through bilateral negotiation or
                            arbitration.</p>
                        <p>4. There is very little likelihood of obtaining Option 1. There could be
                            some possibility of obtaining Options 2 or 3.</p>
                        <p>Issue: Do we refuse to sign the agreement if we do not achieve
                            satisfaction under</p>
                        <p>Option 1? Yes______ No______</p>
                        <p>Option 2? Yes______ No______</p>
                        <p>Option 3? Yes______ No______</p>
                        <p>The remaining alternative would be to sign a multilateral agreement
                            containing the best language we can obtain to preserve our position on
                            this issue.</p>
                        <p>2. The Compensation Issue</p>
                        <p>It will be virtually impossible to achieve prompt solution of the
                            compensation issue. Moreover, there is solid evidence that the other
                            creditors will not support a tough compensation position. While any
                            language on compensation agreed upon with the other creditors would be
                            useful to us in bilateral negotiations and in any future multilateral
                            negotiations with the Chileans, we still must insist on a wording which
                            closely reflects the international legal principle of prompt, adequate
                            and effective compensation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Options:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Require that the Chileans agree to pay prompt, adequate and effective
                            compensation for expropriated property, and if differences exist that
                            they agree to submit the case to binding arbitration under interna<pb
                                n="552" facs="0592" xml:id="pg_552"/>tional law after a reasonable
                            period of time for the completion of the Chilean judicial process.</p>
                        <p>2. Require that the agreement include a clause clearly recognizing the
                            obligation under international law to pay just compensation for
                            expropriated property, and a clause calling upon Chile to meet these
                            obligations through bilateral negotiations or arbitration.</p>
                        <p>Option 1 has some chance of success, although it is possible that the
                            Chileans will refuse to accept it. Option 2 has better chance of
                            success.</p>
                        <p>Issue: Do we refuse to sign the agreement if we do not achieve
                            satisfaction under</p>
                        <p>Option 1? Yes_____ No ______</p>
                        <p>Option 2? Yes_____ No ______</p>
                        <p>The remaining alternative would be to sign a multilateral agreement
                            containing the best language we can obtain to preserve our position on
                            this issue.</p>
                        <p>Footnotes on Treasury views.</p>
                        <p>1) Treasury believes that “This result is unlikely as shown by Chile’s
                            tenacity in seeking a debt settlement.”</p>
                        <p>2) It is Treasury’s judgement that the other creditors as a group “are
                            probably almost as serious and as inflexible as the U.S. on keeping the
                            Chileans on hard terms.”</p>
                        <p>3) Treasury believes that the other creditors are only unlikely to accept
                            a clause which makes it a precondition for the Chilean Government to
                            agree to repay its public debt or guaranteed debt to U.S. companies.</p>

                        <p>On 5 November 1971 the 40 Committee approved new funds in the amount of
                                [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] for the
                            following twelve-month period to support Chilean political parties
                            opposed to the Popular Unity (<gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>)
                            coalition of President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Salvador
                                Allende</persName> and to influence the Radical Party of the Left
                                (<gloss target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss>). In approving these funds,
                            the Committee requested a status report every sixty days which would
                            specify the purpose for which these funds were being expended and assess
                            their effectiveness. This is the second status report, the first having
                            been delayed for two weeks in order to include the results of the 16
                            January 1972 by-elections. The opposition’s success in these
                            by-elections was made possible largely because of the financial aid [<hi
                                rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] which had been
                            approved by the Committee for this purpose on 15 December 1971.</p>
                        <p>The basic period covered by this second status report, January and
                            February 1972 (but with some carry-over into March for continuity
                            purposes), was the summer vacation period in Chile. Party political
                            activity diminished considerably after the extensive effort demanded by
                            the 16 January by-elections, although the inevitability of a new
                            confrontation between the government and the opposition over the “three
                            areas” bill became evident toward the end of February. Funds provided to
                            the opposition parties during this relatively tranquil summer period
                            were used primarily to create new, and improve existing, party
                            mechanisms and to build party media in anticipation of the impending
                            conflict. A total of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>] was passed to the three opposition parties and

                            government was evident in the outcome of the January 1972 by-elections;
                            this decline, coupled with the government’s increasing economic
                            problems, has encouraged opposition parties to believe that they have a
                            chance to retain their control of Congress in the March 1973 general
                            elections. These elections are crucial since the government could carry
                            out its revolutionary program without any legal impediment if it gained
                            a Congressional majority. President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s 7 February announcement of his hope that
                                <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> parties would form a single
                            “Democratic Federation” for the March 1973 elections has generated much
                            politicking, including a variety of proposals for changing the electoral
                            laws to permit formal electoral alliances or to bar single slates. So
                            far, no official move toward unification has been made by either side.
                            In recent days the subject of hypothetical party combinations and voting
                            strengths for the 1973 elections has been submerged by more immediate
                            and mounting political considerations.</p>
                        <p>Political tension began rising in the wake of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s 21 February statement
                            regarding the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>’s “three areas” bill.
                            This bill, which has been passed by Congress with the backing of all
                            opposition parties, divides the economy into three areas—state, mixed,
                            and private. The bill would authorize the government to nationalize only
                            those firms defined in the bill as being essential to the state, and the
                            government also would theoretically have to restore to private or mixed
                            ownership any previously-nationalized firms which did not meet this
                            criterion. The opposition recognizes that this bill is essential to save
                            private enterprise in general, and, especially the 91 major firms
                            designated by the government in January as firms soon to be
                            nationalized.</p>
                        <p>On 21 February, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> not only
                            announced his intention of vetoing the key provisions of the “three
                            areas” bill, but said he would appeal to the Constitutional Tribunal if
                            Congress did not accept his interpretation of the Constitution as
                            requiring a two-thirds majority in each house to override his vetos.
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> President <persName
                                corresp="#p_FMR_1">Fuentealba</persName> responded with a statement,
                            subsequently endorsed by the other opposition parties, contending that a
                            simple majority is all that is required to override Presidential vetos,
                            that the President’s only proper recourse if overridden would be a
                            plebiscite, and that the Constitutional Tribunal is incompetent to hear
                            the case. Negotiations were initiated between the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> and the government aimed at
                            reconciling differences over the “three areas” amendment, but in early
                            March the government began to move against some of the 91 companies on
                            the government list. On 9 March Minister of Economy <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBP_1">Vuskovic</persName> personally led raids on
                            several <pb n="555" facs="0595" xml:id="pg_555"/>companies accused of
                            hoarding, evading price ceilings, etc., and last word was that of the 91
                            firms on the list, three had already been intervened or requisitioned,
                            20 had had merchandise seized, and seven had been fined. This government
                            action caused the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> to break off
                            negotiations. The National Manufacturers Association (<gloss
                                target="#t_SOFOFA_1">SOFOFA</gloss>) issued a strongly worded
                            statement denouncing the government’s actions as flagrant legal and
                            constitutional violations. The <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss>
                            asserted that the opposition was studying the possible impeachment of
                                <persName corresp="#p_VBP_1">Vuskovic</persName>. On 10 March
                            Minister of Interior <persName corresp="#p_DCH_1">del Canto</persName>
                            announced that the government would bring sedition charges against the
                                <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss>’s leadership as well as against
                            the <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss> newspaper and radio station for
                            statements they carried on this question.</p>
                        <p>Future developments in this escalating situation cannot be predicted, but
                            the issue is fundamental and, for the first time, includes a
                            constitutional issue. In by-passing the pending constitutional amendment
                            defining the “three areas” of the economy, the government is achieving
                                <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> nationalization which, if unchecked,
                            will eventually erode the financial base of the entire opposition. By
                            flouting the obvious intent of Congress, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> is also risking the displeasure of the military,
                            which is committed to maintaining constitutional norms. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DN_1">Davis</persName> recently wrote that we
                            are witnessing a race between the deteriorating Chilean economic
                            situation and the deteriorating economic situation of the opposition
                            parties. Neither the duration nor the outcome of this race can be
                            predicted, but the funds now being provided to the opposition are
                            essential to enable these parties to survive and to be prepared for
                            contingencies. No security problems have arisen in connection with any
                            funds passed to date.</p>

                        <p>In September the 40 Committee was presented with options of providing
                            support to <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi>, the largest and most
                            prestigious independent daily newspaper in Chile, to help bail it out of
                            its financial problems or permitting it to go out of business. The
                            ultimate decision was to support <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi>. As
                            a result $700,000 was authorized and expended in support of <hi
                                rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi>. An additional [<hi rend="italic"
                                >dollar amount not declassified</hi>] was given to <hi rend="italic"
                                >El Mercurio</hi> between October and December 1971.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the current political and economic situation in Chile, it
                            is proposed that an additional [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>] be made available to <hi rend="italic">El
                                Mercurio</hi>. Of this amount [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>] would be used to pay off a bank loan which may be
                            called for payment at any time and [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>] would be made available to cover <hi
                                rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi>’s monthly operating deficit through
                            the March 1973 Congressional elections.</p>
                        <p>The balance of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>]
                            would represent a contingency fund for meeting at least some of the bank
                            debts, new taxes and other emergencies which seem to be constantly
                            confronting the newspaper. One such emergency may arise from <hi
                                rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi>’s need for a better line of credit
                            with the U.S. company from which it obtains essential printing and
                            photographic material. Commitments from the contingency fund would be
                            made to <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> based on a documented need
                            for such funds and the endorsement of the Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador and the Chief of Station indicate that <hi rend="italic"
                                >El Mercurio</hi> is a significant element in promoting the
                            opposition cause. In our view <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi>’s
                            continued existence as an independent voice, highly respected both
                            inside and outside Chile, is deemed essential in the forthcoming period
                            leading up to the Congressional elections which, if <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> wins, will permit him to
                            govern on his terms. This means any <pb n="557" facs="0597"

                                Mercurio</hi> must be made on the basis of political rather than
                            fiscal considerations.</p>
                        <p>This proposal has been approved by the Assistant Secretary of State for
                            Inter-American Affairs. The Ambassador has also endorsed this proposal
                            but he believes that it could be implemented with [<hi rend="italic"
                                >dollar amount not declassified</hi>].</p>

                        <p>1. In early September 1971 a memorandum presented two options to the 40
                            Committee in reference to the pressures being exerted by the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government on <hi
                                rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi>. One option would have withheld any
                            financial support and allowed <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> to go
                            out of business, while the other involved financing the paper in the
                            amount of $1,000,000 with an initial commitment of at least $700,000. On
                            13 September $700,000 was authorized to keep <hi rend="italic">El
                                Mercurio</hi> in business. These funds subsequently reached the <hi
                                rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> principals. An additional $300,000
                            was authorized and expended in the period prior to the 16 January 1972
                            by-elections.</p>

                        <p>1. Despite the input of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not

                            serious financial problems which could be aggravated by government
                            credit policies, nationalization of the paper industry, additional back
                            or new taxes, restriction of essential equipment imports, or, by the
                            adverse effects on advertising caused by a further general decline in
                            the Chilean economy. The paper’s operating deficit, partly due to loss
                            of advertising, is now [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>]
                            and this monthly deficit may well increase as Chilean economic problems
                            become more acute.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">External Bank Debts</hi>. The newspaper also has
                            three pending external bank debts which were not covered by the previous

                        <p>Our information indicates <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> will have to
                            liquidate the First Wisconsin National Bank debt in the near future. A
                            factor affecting repayment of this debt is that Chilean law requires
                            such debts be paid through the Chilean Central Bank at a special
                            official rate of 43.4E:$1.00. (It should be noted that <hi rend="italic"
                                >El Mercurio</hi> would need only [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount
                                not declassified</hi>] to handle its external bank debts totalling
                                [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] if it could
                            use escudos purchased at the current black market rate of 80E:$1.00.) It
                            is our intent to enable the <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi>
                            principals to obtain black market escudos so that the First Wisconsin
                            National Bank debt could be liquidated in the near future at the least
                            possible cost. This is necessary because the First Wisconsin National
                            Bank has already requested full payment of indebtedness to it [<hi
                                rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] and has been led
                            to believe by <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> that the requisite
                            escudos have been deposited in the Central Bank, when in fact <hi
                                rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> has not done so and does not have the
                            funds available to do so.</p>
                        <p>A complicating factor in this transaction is that payment by the Chilean
                            Central Bank to the First Wisconsin National Bank of Milwaukee is tied
                            to the outcome of the Chilean government’s current negotiations with
                            U.S. banks on private Chilean debts as well as any rescheduling
                            agreement reached with major foreign creditors in the Paris debt
                            renegotiations.</p>
                        <p>Recently, the Ambassador requested the Department of State to intercede
                            with the First Wisconsin National Bank in an attempt to have the bank
                            relax its pressure on <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi>. This was done,
                            but to no avail. In short, <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> will have
                            to pay the First Wisconsin National Bank debt in the very near future or
                            stop publishing under the present management.</p>

                            operating deficit and its foreign bank debts, <hi rend="italic">El
                                Mercurio</hi> has tax problems. The government has been trying for
                            some time to force <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> to pay 20,700,000
                            escudos in additional back income taxes. The newspaper’s lawyers will
                            contest the payment in the courts, but this claim nonetheless remains a
                            serious threat since, under Chilean law, a substantial portion of such a
                            claim may well have to be placed in escrow pending the outcome of the
                            case.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> also is quite vulnerable to other
                            government pressures including actions restricting the importation of
                            essential printing supplies and equipment, labor problems, credit
                            restrictions, and various types of legal harassments. For example, <hi
                                rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> must import some $500,000 worth of
                            printing and photographic materials each year from the Sun Chemical
                            Company in the United States. These supplies have been purchased on a
                            line of credit which now runs at the $100,000 level, but may have to be
                            raised to $300,000 to cover delays encountered with the Chilean Central
                            Bank in exchange authorizations. <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi>

                            its normal operating costs, so it does not require any special
                            allocation of funds for this purpose. It only needs an extension of its
                            line of credit with the Sun Chemical Company. This is no longer possible
                            through regular commercial channels because U.S. banks have ceased
                            guaranteeing credits for exportations to Chile.</p>
                        <p>If circumstances require us to extend <hi rend="italic">El

                        <p>It is apparent that <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> is in serious
                            financial difficulty while at the same time being quite vulnerable to
                            various forms of government harassment. Thus, any intermediate steps to
                            provide <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> with financial relief,
                            including those proposed herein, do not guarantee the U.S. Government
                            immunity from future requests to help bail it out financially. If, as it
                            now appears, the First Wisconsin National Bank of Milwaukee cannot be
                            persuaded to relax its pressure on debt payment, the paper’s most
                            pressing need will be to meet this debt of [<hi rend="italic">1 line not
                                declassified</hi>]. The next problem is its operating deficit, which
                            so far has been covered by short-term promissory notes with local banks.
                            These banks may well be reaching the limits of their ability to
                            accommodate <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi>, thus each additional
                            loan will become more difficult.</p>
                        <p>Because of many uncertainties, such as the outcome of the Paris debt
                            renegotiations and the attitude of the Chilean courts toward the current
                                <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> tax case, it is not proposed that
                            funds be approved at this time to cover all of the major deficits which
                            might have to be met by <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> between now
                            and the 1973 elections. It will, however, be essential to have
                            sufficient funds authorized and readily available to meet legitimate and
                            urgent needs which cannot be predicted with any precision. It is,
                            therefore, proposed that an additional [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount

                            taxes, foreign bank loans and purchases of supplies abroad. Commitments
                            from contingency funds would be made based on documented need and with
                            the concurrence of the Ambassador.</p>

                        <p>It is considered that the funds requested in this proposal can be made

                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government, since the advances
                            would be made in comparatively small increments. Each new infusion of
                            funds, however, does increase the security hazards, because insertion of
                            funds requires some legal transactions for cover purposes which do leave
                            a trail that is subject to possible future examination. The trail will,
                            however, not lead back to the U.S. Government. Without doubt <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> wants badly to put <hi
                                rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> out of business prior to the 1973
                            elections, and it must be assumed that past pressure on the paper will
                            only increase in the future. The paper is vulnerable to legal actions
                            under the Chilean system as well as to physical attack. (One of <hi
                                rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi>’s publishing plants was vandalized
                            recently, and the paper has been forced to stop its presses three times
                            as a result of technical difficulties which are suspected to have been
                            caused by sabotage.) If <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            is determined to silence <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi>, he will
                            probably find the means with some semblance of legality regardless of
                            the amount of financial support the U.S. Government may provide. Under
                            these circumstances any decision with regard to further financial
                            support of <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> must be based, not on
                            fiscal considerations, but on value judgments regarding the importance
                            of attempting to ensure the paper’s continued existence for political
                            purposes.</p>

                                reporting is unequaled in Chile. The government makes a clear
                                distinction between what <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> says
                                about an issue and what is being said by other opposition media
                                outlets. Articles in <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> produce a
                                quick response from government officials and the government-oriented
                                press, while hard-hitting articles in the other papers cause a
                                lesser reaction. For example, last month <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, in a series of private
                                conversations with <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> leaders,
                                repeatedly stressed that the two major problems facing his
                                government at the present time are the Chilean Armed Forces and “the
                                information media of the political opposition” (of which <hi

                                challenging or criticizing specific editorials on at least several

                                as a “defender of bastard interests” at a public rally. In addition,

                            <p>3. <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> has provided the spiritual
                                leadership and acted as a rallying point for the opposition forces
                                on such key issues as the University of Chile crisis, the “single
                                chamber” issue, and the “three areas of the economy” bill—all
                                extremely significant in the Chilean political context. <hi
                                    rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> has highlighted in a continuing
                                campaign the economic chaos brought on by <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s policies, stressing such
                                aspects as the scarcity of food and consumer items, lack of
                                production, worker dissatisfaction, and credit difficulties.</p>
                            <p>4. It has also taken advantage of political “windfall” incidents,
                                such as the recent physical harassment by the police of cripples
                                demonstrating in front of the presidential palace, and the
                                government’s dual standard in permitting a 23 March demonstration by
                                the Communist-controlled labor confederation while cancelling an
                                opposition rally scheduled for the following night.</p>

                                    >PCCh</gloss>) documents in a four-part series by <hi

                                    <gloss target="#t_PCCh_1">PCCh</gloss>’s efforts to infiltrate
                                the Chilean Armed Forces. This is, of course, a most sensitive issue
                                with the military. The pro-government press reacted quite strongly
                                to the publication of these stories.</p>

                        <p>The General Treaty of Inter-American Arbitration, signed January 5, 1929
                            appears to be the only existing agreement within the Inter-American
                            System which would provide a framework for binding arbitration of the
                            present disputes between the U.S. and Chile and to which both countries
                            are signatories. The bilateral 1914 Treaty for the Settlement of
                            Disputes between the U.S. and Chile has previously been suggested as a
                            possible alternative. This memo considers the applicability of these
                            treaties to the issues presented by the present controversy, the
                            procedural advantages and disadvantages of each, and the character of
                            the arbitral panel each procedure might produce.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Frame of Reference</p>
                        <p>The 1914 Treaty provides that “the . . . Parties agree that <hi
                                rend="italic">all disputes</hi> that may arise in the future between
                            them, shall . . . be submitted [to the procedures specified in the
                            treaty which include arbitration].” However, Article IV provides:</p>
                        <p>“Notwithstanding, any question that may affect the independence, the
                            honor or the vital interests of either or both of the countries, or the
                            provisions of their respective Constitutions, or the interests of a
                            third nation, will not be submitted to such <hi rend="italic">or any
                                other</hi> arbitration.” (emphasis added).</p>
                        <p>Under Article 1 of the 1929 Treaty, the Parties “bind themselves to
                            submit to arbitration all differences of an international character . .
                            . which it has not been possible to adjust by diplomacy and which are
                            juridical in their nature, including “the interpretation of a treaty;
                            any question of international law; the existence of any fact which, if
                            established, would constitute a breach of an international obligation;
                            and the nature and extent of the reparation [for such breach].” Excepted
                            under Article 2 are disputes “within the domestic jurisdiction of any of
                            the <pb n="564" facs="0604" xml:id="pg_564"/>Parties to the dispute and
                            . . . not controlled by international law, and those which affect the
                            interest of [a non-Party State].”</p>
                        <p>Chile signed the 1929 Treaty with the reservation that it did not accept
                            obligatory arbitration with respect to disputes arising out of acts
                            occurring before the treaty entered into force nor</p>
                        <p>“for those questions which, being under the exclusive competency of the
                            national jurisdiction, the interested parties claim the right to
                            withdraw from the cognizance of the established judicial authorities,
                            unless said authorities decline to pass judgment on any action or
                            exception which any natural or juridical foreign person may present to
                            them in the form established by the laws of the country.”</p>
                        <p>This reservation interprets the exception contained in the treaty for
                            “disputes within the domestic jurisdiction of any of the Parties to the
                            dispute” as precluding resort to international arbitration where
                            domestic remedies have been made available.</p>
                        <p>The range of disputes arbitrable under the 1914 Treaty is not restricted
                            to strictly “legal” questions. But, given the fact that the copper
                            expropriations were carried out pursuant to a Constitutional amendment,
                            the disclaimer contained in the 1914 Treaty could be seized upon by
                            political elements in Chile opposed to arbitration of the expropriation
                            question. Furthermore, it would seem desirable to de-emphasize the
                            importance of that Treaty in order to avoid focusing the attention of
                            such groups on the troublesome language contained therein which purports
                            to extend that disclaimer to “any other arbitration.”</p>
                        <p>An agreement to submit the issue of compensation to arbitration under the
                            1929 Treaty, would necessarily imply agreement that the question was not
                            “under the exclusive competency of the national jurisdiction” and was
                            “controlled by international law.” Thus, it seems that the Chilean
                            Government could not agree to arbitration under this treaty of all
                            aspects of the current controversy without prejudicing its position that
                            the measure of compensation to be paid in cases of expropriation is a
                            matter within the exclusive competence of domestic jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Procedures</p>
                        <p>The 1914 Treaty establishes a permanent International Commission to which
                            disputes may be submitted, on the motion of either Government, for
                            investigation and report. The Commission must complete its report within
                            one year from the date it begins the investigation, although this period
                            may be extended by mutual agreement. The Commission’s report is not
                            binding on the parties, but is to serve as the basis for renewed
                            attempts for a negotiated settlement. The scope of this investigatory
                            process is not restricted by the disclaimer previously cited which
                            becomes applicable once the matter is submitted to arbitration. If <pb
                                n="565" facs="0605" xml:id="pg_565"/>after six months from the date
                            the Commission’s report is received a settlement has not been reached,
                            “the dispute will then be submitted to the Permanent Court of
                            Arbitration established at The Hague.” A special convention agreed to by
                            both parties is required to specify “the matter in controversy, the
                            extent of the Arbiters’ powers, [and procedural regulations].” Under
                            Article V, the special convention “remains . . . subject to the
                            constitutional requisites of both countries.”</p>
                        <p>The 1929 Treaty provides for the establishment of an ad hoc arbitral
                            panel in each case. No time limit is set for the selection process.
                            Article 4 provides:</p>
                        <p>The Parties to the dispute shall formulate by common accord, in each
                            case, a special agreement which shall clearly define the particular
                            subject-matter of the controversy, the seat of the court, the rules
                            which will be observed in the proceedings, and the other conditions to
                            which the Parties may agree.</p>
                        <p>If an accord has not been reached with regard to the agreement within
                            three months reckoned from the date of the installation of the court,
                            the agreement shall be formulated by the court.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. ratified the treaty with the understanding “that the special
                            agreement in each case shall be made only by the President, and then
                            only by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, provided two
                            thirds of the Senators present concur.” Under article 8, the
                            reservations made by a party may be invoked against it by the
                            others.</p>
                        <p>The 1914 Treaty would not appear to provide a suitable framework for
                            “prompt” submission of the current disputes to binding arbitration. The
                            apparently mandatory prerequisites of investigation and report by the
                            International Commission and renewed negotiations by the parties would
                            undoubtedly require the full 18 month period provided for in the treaty
                            before the matter could even be submitted to binding arbitration.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the scope of the Commission’s investigation and report would
                            not be restricted by a prior compromis, and the possibility should not
                            be overlooked that should the matter eventually go to arbitration, the
                            decision of the arbitrators might be influenced by the outcome of the
                            prior proceedings before the Commission. It should be noted that either
                            party may invoke the investigatory process, and that both are bound to
                            “furnish the Permanent International Commission with all the means and
                            facilities required for its investigation and report.” Thus, if Chile
                            were so disposed it could force submission of the question to this
                            procedure.</p>
                        <p>The 1929 Treaty also contains potential for delay. Article I of that
                            Treaty provides that “the provisions of this Treaty shall not preclude
                            any of the parties, before resorting to arbitration, from having
                            recourse to procedures of investigation and conciliation established on
                                conven<pb n="566" facs="0606" xml:id="pg_566"/>tions then in force
                            between them.” In testifying before the Senate Committee on Foreign
                            Relations the Secretary of State, Mr. Kellogg, stated with respect to
                            this provision that “if any of the parties desires conciliation first,
                            it is entitled to have recourse to that procedure by an unilateral
                            request.” Thus, the 1929 Treaty, like the 1914 Treaty, could be seized
                            upon by a party to delay the initiation of the arbitration process.
                            Unlike the 1914 Treaty, however, this Treaty does not of its own force
                            require prior investigatory proceedings.</p>
                        <p>The major procedural obstacle to prompt arbitration of the current
                            dispute under the 1929 Treaty would be the U.S. reservation. It would
                            clearly make necessary the approval of the U.S. Senate to any compromis
                            that might be formulated between the executive branches of the U.S. and
                            Chilean Governments. In addition, although the Treaty does not
                            explicitly require the approval of the compromis by the Chilean Senate,
                            the fact that the reciprocity provision would permit the Chilean
                            Government to insist upon such a procedure vis à vis the U.S. could tend
                            to engender political pressure within the Chilean system to do so. The
                            reservation also precludes the alternative of formulation of the accord
                            by the court itself.</p>
                        <p>A question has been raised as to whether the reservation could be
                            construed as applying only in cases where the United States is the real
                            party in interest. The 1929 Treaty was first submitted to the U.S.
                            Senate for its advice and consent in 1929. In 1932, the Senate consented
                            with reservations which were determined by the Department to be
                            unacceptable. Accordingly, the President declined to ratify the Treaty
                            and in 1934 resubmitted it to the Senate with a view to eliminating the
                            most unacceptable of the reservations. In a letter to Senator Pittman,
                            Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, dated February
                            19, 1934 the Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, proposed a substitute
                            resolution which included the following provision:</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Resolved (two-thirds of the Senators present
                                concurring therein)</hi>, That the Senate advise and consent to the
                            ratification of Executive ,Congress,Session, a General Treaty of
                            Inter-American arbitration, signed at Washington, January 5, 1929, with
                            the understanding to be made a part of such ratification, that the
                            special agreement provided for in Article 4 of the treaty, <hi
                                rend="italic">in each case where the question to be arbitrated
                                concerns a claim against the United States</hi>, shall be made on
                            the part of the Government of the United States of America only by the
                            President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,
                            notwithstanding any provisions of the treaty to the contrary.”</p>
                        <p>The language limiting the requirement of Senate approval to cases
                            involving claims against the U.S. was deleted from the reservation
                            finally adopted by the Senate and approved by the President. It would be
                            difficult to overcome the argument that the Senate was well aware that
                            the effect of the reservation could have been restricted to particular
                                <pb n="567" facs="0607" xml:id="pg_567"/>types of matters and that
                            it rejected this approach in favor of a generally applicable
                            provision.</p>
                        <p>As previously noted, the special convention required in each case under
                            the 1914 Treaty procedure “remains . . . subject to the constitutional
                            requisites of both countries.” I have been unable to locate any
                            definitive background information regarding the purpose of this
                            provision. <gloss target="#t_LT_1">L/T</gloss> has expressed the view,
                            however, that this provision should be read in the context of the
                            position traditionally taken by the U.S. Senate that its consent to the
                            agreement of the U.S. to arbitrate should be sought with respect to each
                            individual arbitration. The reservation advanced by the Senate with
                            respect to U.S. ratification of the 1929 Treaty was one manifestation of
                            that view. Similar understandings are included in U.S. ratifications of
                            a number of bilateral and multi-lateral arbitration treaties. The
                            legislative history of the ratification of the 1929 Treaty demonstrates
                            a Senatorial concern that the compromis in each case constituted a
                            separate treaty, and therefore, that the Senate could not waive or
                            delegate to the Executive its Constitutional authority with respect to
                            such agreements.</p>
                        <p>Apparently, no distinction was made under this view between arbitrations
                            in which the U.S. was the real party in interest and those involving the
                            claims of U.S. nationals against foreign governments. An example of
                            contemporary practice is found in “a protocol relative to a claim on the
                            government of Chile in the case of the ship “Good Return” signed
                            December 6, 1873 between the U.S. and Chile. The claim related to an
                            American whaling vessel which had been seized by Chilean authorities in
                            1832. Although the protocol concluded for the ad hoc arbitration of the
                            issue presented no possibility that the U.S. could be held liable, it
                            was explicitly subject to approval by both Governments, and was
                            submitted to the U.S. Senate for ratification. It is interesting to note
                            that the protocol also explicitly provided that it would come into force
                            “previous to its approval by the national congress of [Chile].”</p>
                        <p>In more recent years, a distinction has been made in practice between
                            cases involving potential liability of the U.S.G. and those in which no
                            such issue existed. L/C has informed me that the U.S. has been party to
                            only one arbitration since World War II. That case involved the claims
                            of U.S. landowners whose property had been flooded by the construction
                            of Gutt Dam in Canada. Authorizing legislation was sought in that case
                            (a) because appropriations were required to pay both the U.S. agent and
                            our share of the costs of the arbitration and (b) because there was the
                            possibility of a Canadian counter-claim against the U.S.G. A number of
                            arbitrations conducted prior to the war which did not involve potential
                            U.S. liability were undertaken by Executive Agreement, without
                            Congressional authority. Funds necessary to defer the necessary costs
                            were provided for in the Department’s appro<pb n="568" facs="0608"
                                xml:id="pg_568"/>priation without special authorization. Thus, it
                            would appear that whatever the Senatorial view may have been in 1914
                            with regard to the “constitutional requisites” of concluding a
                            compromis, under the modern view no Senate approval of such agreements
                            is required unless potential liability of the U.S. is involved. A strong
                            argument could therefore be made that the advice and consent of the
                            Senate is not required to conclude a compromis under the 1914 Treaty. It
                            would be difficult to make the same argument with respect to the 1929
                            Treaty, however, since the U.S. reservation thereto is explicit with
                            respect to the procedure to be followed.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Composition of the Arbitral Panels</p>
                        <p>The 1914 Treaty provides for submission of disputes to the Permanent
                            Court of Arbitration at The Hague, the membership of which would be
                            determined in accordance with the agreements establishing that body. The
                            composition of the Permanent International Commission charged with
                            conducting the preliminary investigation of the dispute is provided for
                            by the Treaty itself. Each Government is to appoint two members, only
                            one of whom may be of its own nationality. The fifth member, the
                            President, is chosen by agreement between the two Governments and he may
                            not be of the same nationality as any of the other members. Prior to the
                            beginning of the investigation, each government may replace the members
                            appointed by it and may withdraw its approval of the fifth member. If a
                            successor cannot be agreed upon within 30 days, the President of the
                            Swiss Confederation is to appoint one.</p>
                        <p>As you know, Chile has designated as members of the Commission Messrs.
                            Edmundo Vargas of Chile and Manfred Lachs of Poland and has agreed with
                            the U.S. upon the appointment of Mme. Suzanne Bastid of France as
                            President. The U.S. in 1965 notified Chile that it would appoint the
                            remaining two members “in due time” but has failed to do so.</p>
                        <p>The 1929 Treaty provides for the designation of an arbitrator or tribunal
                            by mutual agreement or, in the absence of such agreement, provides for
                            selection of a five member panel. Each party may select one member from
                            the persons it has designated as members of the <gloss target="#t_PCA_1"
                                >PCA</gloss>. Each may designate another member who may be a
                            national of any other “American” state. The fifth member is to be
                            selected by the other four, with preference being given to persons of
                            “American” nationality. Failing agreement, each designates a
                            “non-American” member of the <gloss target="#t_PCA_1">PCA</gloss> and
                            these two persons select the fifth member, the only restriction being
                            that he not be a national of either party to the dispute. Although this
                            procedure clearly favors an “all-American” panel, it would appear to
                            provide adequate protection against a Latin American majority (e.g. <pb

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>Neither the 1914 bilateral nor the 1929 Inter-American treaty would
                            appear to provide a satisfactory framework for the comprehensive
                            arbitration of the issues outstanding between the U.S. and Chile. The
                            primary obstacle to such arbitration under both procedures is the fact
                            that Chile has previously taken positions respecting the nature of the
                            primary issues which clearly imply that they are not arbitrable within
                            the frames of reference of the existing treaties. Although Chile might
                            find it possible to submit selected issues under these procedures (e.g.
                            the suggestion that the partial repudiation of the Braden debt be
                            resolved through the 1914 procedure), it is doubtful that the U.S. could
                            accept such a limited treatment of the overall problem unless adequate
                            assurances were made that the other issues would be dealt with
                            effectively through other means. In addition, both procedures are
                            fraught with potentialities for delay and provide further opportunities
                            for interference by opposition elements.</p>
                        <p>Neither treaty would appear to offer a comprehensive model for an ad hoc
                            agreement. It might be acceptable to the U.S. to agree to utilize the
                            investigatory panel already partially designated under the 1914 Treaty
                            or the procedure for selecting a panel provided for in the 1929 Treaty
                            in order to create the impression that both countries were adhering to
                            previous international commitments if this would be politically
                            advantageous to the Chilean Government. In addition, this procedure
                            might prove less disparaging to the efficacy of the Inter-American
                            system than would a total rejection of existing dispute settlement
                            procedures in favor of a completely ad hoc arrangement.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that both the 1914 and 1929 Treaties provide Chile
                            with opportunities to seriously delay or prejudice the possibility of
                            submitting the issues to arbitration while appearing to honor its
                            international obligations in this respect. Under either Treaty, Chile
                            could force submission of the issue to a lengthy conciliation process in
                            which the panel would be without benefit of a joint compromis
                            specifically defining the issues. The investigatory processes could be
                            directed towards irrelevant but potentially embarrassing questions such
                            as the <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> affair. Ultimately, Chile
                            could agree to submit the issue to arbitration, subject to legislative
                            consent, and then orchestrate a non-partisan rejection of the process on
                            the grounds that the issues involved are excluded from the frames of
                            reference of these agreements.</p>
                        <p>Thus, it seems that emphasis should be placed upon formulating an ad hoc
                            arrangement which would permit the prompt submission <pb n="570"
                                facs="0610" xml:id="pg_570"/>and resolution of the issues without
                            prejudicing either party’s legal position.</p>

                        <p>The second Status Report on Financial Support to Opposition Parties in
                            Chile, dated 6 April 1972, informed the 40 Committee that a coordinated
                            effort was being made to induce the Radical Party of the Left (<gloss
                                target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss>) to leave the government Popular Unity
                                (<gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>) coalition. [<hi rend="italic"

                            clientele had told <gloss target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss> leaders in March
                            1972 that he could raise [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not

                            available to the <gloss target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss> the day they broke
                            with the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>. On 6 April the <gloss

                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> is a serious political setback to
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> since it undermines
                            the broad-based image of popular support which he has been attempting to
                            create, and weakens his chances of putting together a winning coalition
                            in the 1973 Congressional elections.</p>
                        <p>On 5 November 1971 the 40 Committee authorized [<hi rend="italic">dollar

                            in the 1970 presidential election. The 40 Committee also approved [<hi

                            on 3 August 1971, for the purpose of fostering dissension within the

                            authorized to use [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not

                                target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss> in the period through July 1972. In
                            addition, authority is requested to use an additional [<hi rend="italic"
                                >dollar amount not declassified</hi>] which is available within
                            existing Agency funds, to support the <gloss target="#t_PIR_1"
                                >PIR</gloss> through October 1972. In October a new proposal will be

                            during the period preceding the March 1973 Congressional elections. In
                            our view, the total [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss> (formerly called the <gloss

                                target="#t_PR_1">PR</gloss> on 3 August 1971, immediately following
                            the PR’s national convention. <gloss target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss>
                            leaders, who include five senators and seven deputies, issued a lengthy
                            statement criticizing the “rigging” of the convention and the PR’s
                            adoption of Marxist ideology, while describing their new party as
                            democratic and non-Marxist—a stance which appeals to a large number of
                            former <gloss target="#t_PR_1">PR</gloss> members. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> made a strong effort to retain
                            the support of the <gloss target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss>, and in January
                            1972 the party accepted two cabinet posts (Minister of Justice and
                            Minister of Mines). Despite this close association of the <gloss

                                >UP</gloss>, it was apparent that a majority of <gloss

                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] established channels of

                                <gloss target="#t_PR_1">PR</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_PIR_1"
                                >PIR</gloss> split, and by October 1971 had become convinced that
                            the availability of financial support would be a decisive factor in
                            determining the party’s future course. After the 40 Committee’s approval

                            problems, including their reasons for distrusting promises of support
                            from the business community, which had defaulted on similar commitments
                            in the past. By making a series of increasingly substantial but still

                            regarding this support. On 6 April the two <gloss target="#t_PIR_1"

                            the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> coalition includes non-Marxist
                            parties whose major appeal is to the middle class, of which the <gloss

                        <p>In outlining their financial needs, <gloss target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss>
                            leaders have reported that their only income [<hi rend="italic">less

                            a month, most of which comes from Chilean businessmen of Lebanese
                            background who have been traditional supporters of various Radical Party
                            factions. At a minimum, the party will need an additional [<hi
                                rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] escudos a month for
                            operating expenses, and hopes to obtain about [<hi rend="italic">number
                                not declassified</hi>] escudos for the electoral campaigns of the
                            two <gloss target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss> senators and seven deputies
                            whose terms expire in March 1973 as well as for other <gloss
                                target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss> congressional candidates. The <gloss
                                target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss> also intends to buy Radio Yungay, in
                            order to have its own media outlet, and plans to use the [<hi
                                rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] escudos which they
                            received on 6 April [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] for this purpose. Acquisition of this particular
                            station has been a Radical Party objective for a long time. In January
                            1971 the 40 Committee authorized [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>] to enable the <gloss target="#t_PDR_1"
                                >PDR</gloss> to purchase Radio Yungay, but this authorization was
                            never implemented because <gloss target="#t_PDR_1">PDR</gloss> leaders
                            decided they could not manage or maintain the station effectively. The
                            Embassy and the Station are both concerned about continuing <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> efforts to increase the number of radios
                            under their control, and believe that the <gloss target="#t_PIR_1"
                                >PIR</gloss>’s acquisition of this small Santiago station is
                            desirable as one of the principal means by which <gloss
                                target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss> political momentum can be maintained.
                            Details regarding the radio’s purchase price and current terms of sale

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss> will need an estimated [<hi

                            support to cover monthly operating expenses through October 1972, by
                            which time a new proposal will be submitted to the 40 Committee
                            outlining the financial needs of all opposition parties for the March
                            1973 Congressional election campaign. One half [<hi rend="italic">less

                            previously authorized by the Committee for the <gloss target="#t_PDR_1"
                                >PDR</gloss> and could be used to cover operating expenses for the
                            months of May, June and July 1972. The remaining [<hi rend="italic"
                                >dollar amount not declassified</hi>] for operating expenses for
                            August, September and October 1972 is available within the Agency. The

                            costs was provided by <gloss target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss> leaders

                            opening of the March 1973 election campaign. These funds would serve the

                            would thus consist of the [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not

                                    Marxist and non-Marxist forces indicated a political shift away

                            elections at the University of Chile is being submitted because the
                            contest between Marxist and non-Marxist forces in the university was an
                            event of national importance with the non-Marxist candidate for rector
                            gaining an absolute majority over the personal candidate of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. Political trends in
                            Chile have often been forecast by university elections; and, in this
                            year’s highly charged political atmosphere, more significance than usual
                            was attached to the outcome of these university elections by political
                            forces in Chile.</p>
                        <p>2. The University of Chile is the country’s largest and most important
                            institution of higher learning with over 60,000 students. The main
                            campus is located in Santiago but the university also has campuses in
                            eight provincial centers throughout Chile. Student politics have always
                            been an integral part of the University of Chile where campus
                            organizations represent national political parties and serve as a
                            training ground for future political leaders. In recent years,
                            administrative control of the university also has become a sought-after
                            prize of the contending political forces. The university is jointly
                            directed by three “estates:” students, faculty, and staff. Voting is
                            weighted, with the faculty having 65% of the voice in the final results;
                            students, 25%; and non-teaching staff, 10%. This voting spread, plus the
                            distribution of campuses throughout the country, lends somewhat of a
                            national character to these university elections.</p>
                        <p>3. In the last university elections (June 1971), Marxist and non-Marxist
                            forces were almost evenly matched. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Edgardo Boeninger</persName>, supported by non-Marxist students and
                            professors, was reelected rector of the university, but the Marxists
                            gained a majority on the 100 <pb n="576" facs="0616" xml:id="pg_576"
                            />member university advisory council. Efforts by the Marxist-controlled
                            council to obtain political control of the university erupted into
                            violence in October and November 1971. The resulting crisis was not
                            finally resolved until January 1972, when both the rector and the
                            council resigned after agreeing to new elections in April 1972. These
                            elections were to choose the two key administrative officers (Rector and
                            Secretary-General) and a new council as well as to hold a university
                            plebiscite on a number of questions relating to university
                            reorganization and internal administration.</p>
                        <p>4. There were four candidates for the rectorship. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE_1">Boeninger</persName>, running for reelection, was
                            supported by the University Front, a coalition of forces in opposition
                            to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. His chief rival was
                                <persName corresp="#p_HLF_1">Felipe Herrera</persName>, former
                            president of the Inter-American Development Bank (<gloss
                                target="#t_IADB_1">IADB</gloss>), who had been in charge of
                            preparations for the United Nations Council on Trade and Development
                                (<gloss target="#t_UNCTAD_1">UNCTAD</gloss>) which is now meeting in
                            Santiago. <persName corresp="#p_HLF_1">Herrera</persName> was persuaded
                            by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to resign from <gloss
                                target="#t_UNCTAD_1">UNCTAD</gloss> in order to run for the
                            rectorship. He received strong support from the government and the
                            government’s Popular Unity (<gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>)
                            coalition. Two ultra-leftist candidates were also in the running: Andres
                            Pascal <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, a nephew of the
                            President, and Luis Vitale. Although these two minor candidates were
                            expected to attract some leftist votes away from <persName
                                corresp="#p_HLF_1">Herrera</persName>, they also bolstered <persName
                                corresp="#p_HLF_1">Herrera</persName>’s efforts to appear as a
                            candidate of the center and to attract independent and conservative
                            support.</p>
                        <p>5. [<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (16½ lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>6. The results of the elections were as follows: <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE_1">Boeninger</persName>, 51.86%; <persName
                                corresp="#p_HLF_1">Herrera</persName>, 43.63%; Pascal, 3.66%; and
                            Vitale, 0.85%. Unofficial returns also indicate that the <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE_1">Boeninger</persName> forces have definitely won 53
                            of the 100 positions on the university council, with the possibility of
                            gaining one or two more. No information on the outcome of the plebiscite
                            has been released, although it has been reported in one newspaper that
                            the viewpoints advocated by the <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Boeninger</persName> forces carried the day.</p>
                        <p>7. The Attachment hereto shows the voting patterns for the rectorship in
                            both the June 1971 and April 1972 elections. In general, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE_1">Boeninger</persName> obtained a higher percentage
                            of the student vote this time (51.7% as contrasted with 47.7% in June
                            1971) which more than offset a slight drop in faculty support (to 52.6%
                            from 53.8% in June 1971). There seems to be little doubt that <persName
                                corresp="#p_HLF_1">Herrera</persName> appealed to some independent
                            and conservative professors. The victory of the democratic University
                            Front in these elections should provide some impetus for the opposition
                            in the upcoming Chilean Student Federation (FECH) elections, which are
                            now scheduled to be held in late May or early June 1972. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE_1">Boeninger</persName>’s victory also should assist
                            opposition efforts to oust <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> forces
                            from control of the university’s TV Channel 9 which is one of the most
                            widely viewed TV stations in Chile.</p>
                        <pb n="577" facs="0617" xml:id="pg_577"/>
                        <p>8. The university elections were widely regarded in Chile as an important
                            weathervane of national political opinion. Had <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE_1">Boeninger</persName> been defeated, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> could have claimed it was the
                            beginning of a new and favorable trend for the government. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> also would have had a
                            ready-made theme for his May Day speech and for the numerous delegates
                            now attending the <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD_1">UNCTAD</gloss> conference
                            in Santiago. As things turned out, the university elections represent
                            still another politically embarrassing reverse for <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> while maintaining and
                            increasing the momentum of the political opposition.</p>

                        <p>You should be aware of the following:</p>
                        <p>We have a report that outbreaks of violence may occur in Chile beginning
                            tomorrow (May 19) culminating in an attempt to assassinate President
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> on Sunday (May 21).
                            The information—which comes from two sources, [<hi rend="italic">2 lines
                                not declassified</hi>]—is too detailed to be ignored. It may, of
                            course, be exaggerated. However, rumors of impending violence—and even
                            civil war—have begun to spread through Santiago.</p>
                        <p>The plot is attributed to leaders of the Movement of the Revolutionary
                            Left (<gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss>), a group dedicated to
                            revolutionary violence. They are reportedly disillusioned with <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> because of his failure to move
                            Chile faster and farther toward leftist totalitarian rule. They are
                            opposed by the Communist Party of Chile which supports <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> in his policy of gradualism in
                            building a socialist state. It is the Communists who reportedly have
                            disclosed the <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> plot to <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> plan appears to be: to foment
                            serious civil disturbances in southern Chile. This would draw
                            significant elements of the Army to the south and away from Santiago.
                            Then, on Sunday May 21, when <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> is scheduled to open the new session of the
                            Congress, the <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> would strike in
                            Santiago—with terror and murder and massive violence.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has taken the threat
                            with enough seriousness to triple his own bodyguard. He is also reported
                            to have put Chilean Army units in the south on special alert. We also
                            have a report that he has called a special emergency session of leaders
                            of Popular Unity (<gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>), the government
                            coalition, to consider how to deal with the problem.</p>
                        <p>The Communists are said to have threatened to withdraw from the ruling
                            coalition unless <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> takes
                            forceful action to oppose the <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss>
                            promptly. The Communists are reportedly demanding an immediate
                            confrontation with MIR. They are also insisting that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> remove <pb n="579" facs="0619"
                                xml:id="pg_579"/>some 700 <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss>
                            members or sympathizers from government jobs. Our intelligence sources
                            indicate that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is not the
                            only intended victim of attack. Apparently there may also be attempts
                            made on the lives of some Communist Party leaders and even some foreign
                            diplomats (especially Communists). The purpose of these actions is said
                            to be to “prove” that rightists are responsible for the violence. Once
                            violence erupts, the <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> would use the
                            resulting confusion as a pretext for revolution and violent take-over of
                            authority.</p>
                        <p>There is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> indication in any of the intelligence
                            reports of anything more than coincidence between the alleged plotting
                            of violence in Chile and President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                >Nixon</persName>’s departure for Moscow.</p>

                        <p>During the Senior Review Group Meeting of April 11, 1972, on Chile debt
                            renegotiation, the question of <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>
                            levels for Chile came up. The <gloss target="#t_SRG_1">SRG</gloss>
                            members present agreed that a level up to $10 million for <gloss
                                target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1972 was appropriate. This would be
                            approximately double the <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1971 level,
                            but would not be out of line with levels in other Latin American
                            countries of comparable size and would be consistent with our desire to
                            maintain some influence with the Chilean military in the face of massive
                            credit offers from the Soviet Union. The Treasury Department concurred,
                            but recommended that the decision be deferred until after <pb n="580"
                                facs="0620" xml:id="pg_580"/>the Paris Club meeting on Chile’s debt

                            members agreed.</p>
                        <p>The Paris Club meeting was brought to a satisfactory conclusion and
                            Treasury has already informed the Department of Defense that it
                            withdraws any objections it may have had to proceeding with the program
                            at the $10 million level. With the growing opposition to <persName

                        <p>1. Summary: On July 10 I met with President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> as instructed <gloss target="#t_reftel_1"
                                >reftel</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            responded to my presentation by sharply criticizing <gloss
                                target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> ’s action in Chile. He said that only
                            with difficulty had he been able to overcome strong pressures within
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> to confiscate <gloss
                                target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> assets. He offered “private” support
                            with President Chilean Senate to convert appraisal mechanism in proposed
                            amendment to appraisal by international commission. He displayed some
                            irritation over<gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss>to Bolivia and
                            omission of Chile from itineraries of high-level US travellers. He spoke
                            in general terms about solutions to US-Chilean problems that would lead
                            to more positive economic relations, mentioning possibility <pb n="581"
                                facs="0621" xml:id="pg_581"/>of both a Cerro-like arrangement by
                            which Anaconda could receive payment and a global package deal which
                            might resolve debt/compensation issues between us. His remarks reflected
                            his obvious concern over deterioration of Chilean economy. End
                            summary.</p>
                        <p>2. President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> received me
                            last Saturday morning in his Tomas Moro residence. Telling President I
                            was speaking under instructions, I made points contained paragraph 3,
                                <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>. When I suggested
                            possibility of equitable appraisal procedures as per paragraph 4, I
                            invited President’s reaction. He answered that he would like to hear out
                            everything I had to say before making any comment. Therefore, I
                            completed my own presentation, making statements contained paragraph
                            5.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> began his answer by
                            citing <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> ’s “improper and
                            inadmissible” activities. He said any other country whose dignity had
                            been so assaulted would have confiscated Chiltelco outright. He said
                            that Chilean public opinion has been a continuous limiting factor on his
                            freedom of action during recent weeks and that he found himself under
                            most severe attack in his own Socialist Party. He was accused of being
                            “soft.” There was no question, the President said, that <gloss
                                target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> had been guilty of direct intervention
                            in Chilean affairs. He, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>,
                            had stretched the limits of his political room for maneuver in
                            presenting the bill and amendment, which he did. In present situation,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> must take position
                            that he will not rpt not receive representatives of <gloss
                                target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss>. President added as an aside that he
                            would not receive Anaconda either, because of their embargo. Returning
                            to <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> asserted (as he had on May 12), that Chile
                            proposed deducting essentially only those monies which <gloss
                                target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> had illegally obtained over the years.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> said he had stood up
                            to great pressure in holding the line against confiscation.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> went on to assert that
                            he was doing his best to prevent <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss>
                            case from exacerbating our relations. He said he had requested Chilean
                            press to play down <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> matter—within
                            limits of his ability to influence a press which remains free. He had
                            asked press not to attack U.S. Government, nor to pursue personal attack
                            against Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>. While
                            he was obviously in no position to silence press altogether, he said he
                            believed his efforts to induce restraint had had significant
                            results.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> then turned to the
                            question of appraisal. He said he did not think it would now be useful
                            for U.S. experts to talk with Executive Branch of <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>, as <gloss target="#t_ITT_1"
                                >ITT</gloss> matter now is in the hands of Chilean Congress. (He
                            made no reference to <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss>, although I
                            had made clear that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> experts would
                            include an <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss> representative.)
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> said that perhaps
                            Chilean Senate—or President of Senate might receive US experts. After
                            momentary pause, he somewhat reversed himself, saying <pb n="582"
                                facs="0622" xml:id="pg_582"/>better idea might be for him to talk
                            with Senate President privately and explore possibility of changing
                            appraisal mechanism to one that would put responsibility in hands of an
                            international commission. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> suggested that I also talk to Senate President
                            along these lines. He reiterated that he would not oppose such an
                            idea—and would privately, repeat privately, give it his support.</p>
                        <p>5. Changing the subject, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            alluded to Bolivia and the magnitude of U.S. military assistance to that
                            country. I remarked that we seem to be criticized no matter what we do
                            in the military assistance field. There had even been press criticism in
                            Peru of our extremely modest grant program to Chile. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> remarked that it was nonsense
                            to criticize the few training grants that our program consisted of “and
                            the $5 (sic) million dollars or so we were providing in credit. . . .
                            The Soviet Union would give us 500 scholarships for military training
                            any time.” Regarding Bolivia, I told <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> I could assure him that there was no U.S.
                            Government desire to encourage any sort of Bolivian adventurism with
                            regard to Chile. U.S. military support, which was not very great in any
                            case, was directly related to Bolivia’s own needs. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> answered “Yes,” he understood
                            and accepted the fact that this was true.</p>
                        <p>6. In an indirect reference to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJB_1"
                                >Connally</persName>’s trip, President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> mentioned high-level visits to Latin America. He
                            complained that such visits seem to include up to half a dozen countries
                            in South America and yet skip Chile. He supposed that when Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> takes a turn around the
                            Hemisphere, he will probably skip Chile, too. I remarked that I did not
                            think visit itineraries were the important problem between us. What we
                            needed on both sides was a serious effort to work out our substantive
                            problems, such as debt and compensation. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> then turned to the theme of U.S. economic policy
                            toward Chile. He said he knew the U.S. Government would not send the
                            Marines to land on Chilean shores, but the economic effects of our
                            policy toward Chile were in some respects even more damaging. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> said Chile was having to turn
                            to Japan for heavy equipment needed in the copper mines. Chile was being
                            starved for spare parts. I remarked that U.S. suppliers were perfectly
                            willing to sell Chile any spare parts desired. The question is not one
                            of denial, but of credit. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> agreed that was true. I added that the U.S.
                            Government remains fully ready to look for a mutual acceptable solution
                            for our differences.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> suggested that I talk
                            to Anaconda, and see if they might propose something similar to the
                            recent deal worked out with the Cerro Corporation. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> reflected-out-loud about the
                            possibility of some arrangement whereby Chile would agree to sell
                            Anaconda copper over a period of years at a discount price. In any case,
                            he said, there must be some formula which could be worked out. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> asked <pb n="583" facs="0623"
                                xml:id="pg_583"/>me to explore the possibility of some sort of
                            package—perhaps one which would cover the whole range of our bilateral
                            debt and compensation problems. Then I might come back to him again for
                            further private discussion. I might also talk with “Arrate or
                            Matus—better Arrate.” <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            said he would very much like to find a way to pay Anaconda some millions
                            of dollars over a period of years. He said he also wants the copper
                            tribunal to find the way open to review the excess profits question. He
                            added, that I must remember that Chilean courts are free, and the
                            President cannot tell them what to decide. Returning to the idea of some
                            global formula, he said he would like me to look into that possibility,
                            and added that he hoped it might include renewed credits. He once again
                            reaffirmed that he was fully prepared to consider a package solution.
                            But I should understand he is operating within real limitations. He
                            cannot do anything and everything, but said he was prepared to try to
                            work something out. I told the President I would consult and see what
                            concrete proposals might be possible.</p>
                        <p>8. Comment: We have been getting a few indications that the economic
                            squeeze is pushing Chilean leaders toward thinking more seriously about
                            U.S.-Chilean economic accommodation. It is interesting that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AOC_1">Altamirano</persName> reportedly mentioned this
                            possibility in a private meeting with <persName corresp="#p_CLL_1"
                                >Corvalan</persName> in mid May. (HCS–8846) Soviet Ambassador Barsov
                            also returned my call the other day and questioned me rather pointedly
                            about US conditions for some sort of settlement. As a realistic matter,
                            I doubt if <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> or the others
                            are yet thinking of concessions we would regard as satisfactory.
                            Nevertheless, I do believe there is a flicker of more serious Chilean
                            interest in finding a way out of the box they are in. The economic
                            pressures on Chile are increasing, and these pressures may have some
                            added influence in the weeks ahead, perhaps moving Chilean thinking
                            toward a more genuine flexibility than now exists.</p>
                        <p>9. Regarding President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            offer to talk with Senate President <persName corresp="#p_PJ_2"
                                >Palma</persName> about international appraisal for <gloss
                                target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss>, I think he was most candid when he
                            said he would “not oppose” such an action by the Senate. I plan to talk
                            to <persName corresp="#p_PJ_2">Palma</persName> and also encourage

                            willing to see the Christian Democrats take the onus of international

                        <p>10. Regarding Anaconda and/or some sort of larger global package, I doubt
                            that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has thought the
                            matter through. What he said should be regarded more as a reflection of
                            attitude than as something specific. It does give us an opportunity to
                            put ideas forward in as narrow or broad a context as we may consider
                            useful. Cerro demonstrated both flexibility and ingenuity in its recent
                            negotiation to take Chuquicamata’s smelter intermediates (Santiago
                            2801). It might be <pb n="584" facs="0624" xml:id="pg_584"/>worthwhile
                            to explore a range of possibilities with Anaconda. I believe the
                            Department also still plans to give me some reactions to the ideas I put
                            forward in Santiago 2522.</p>

                                    follows: “Highlights are the successful inducement of the

                                    note that “opposition parties are reducing inter-party strife
                                    and improving their individual internal organization.” At the

                            purposes for which funds authorized by the Committee for support of
                            opposition parties in Chile are being expended. This report also
                            assesses the effectiveness of this support during the period March and
                            April 1972.</p>
                        <p>On 5 November 1971 the 40 Committee approved [<hi rend="italic">dollar

                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Salvador Allende</persName>. These parties are
                            the Christian Democratic Party (<gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>),
                            the National Party (<gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss>), and the
                            Democratic Radical Party (<gloss target="#t_PDR_1">PDR</gloss>). The
                            Committee also approved [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>] to influence the Radical Party of the Left
                                (<gloss target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss>), which was then a member of
                            the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> coalition. On 24 April 1972 the
                            Committee approved the expenditure of an additional [<hi rend="italic"
                                >dollar amount not declassified</hi>] through October 1972 to
                            support the <gloss target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss>, which had left the
                                <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> and joined the opposition.</p>

                        <p>Two particularly significant developments during the period March and

                            Committee. These reports described [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                                not declassified</hi>] successful efforts to induce the <gloss
                                target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss> to leave the government and the <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>, and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                                not declassified</hi>] at the University of Chile, where the
                            opposition won both the rectorship and a majority of seats on the
                            university council in the 27 April 1972 elections. Funds passed to all
                            opposition parties during March and April totaled [<hi rend="italic"
                                >dollar amount not declassified</hi>], of which [<hi rend="italic"
                                >dollar amount not declassified</hi>] was passed to the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>, [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not

                            This means that since November 1971 a total of [<hi rend="italic">dollar
                                amount not declassified</hi>] has been spent on the <gloss

                            and <gloss target="#t_PDR_1">PDR</gloss> and [<hi rend="italic">dollar

                                >PIR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>All funds have been used effectively by the opposition parties, both to
                            build party organizational and media strength and to achieve an almost
                            uninterrupted series of electoral victories. The opposition is now
                            convinced that it has the support of the majority of Chileans, and
                            intends to adopt increasingly aggressive “confrontation politics” in
                            anticipation of the 1973 congressional elections.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                            <hi rend="roman">II.</hi> Background</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss>’s withdrawal from the government
                            and the opposition victory in the April 1972 elections at the University
                            of Chile were the most recent in a series of political achievements by
                            forces opposed to the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            regime. These achievements have had three major effects: first, the
                            opposition is now even more convinced of its ability to oppose the
                            government successfully in the political arena and has therefore adopted
                            a posture of open confrontation which will have the effect of elevating
                            political tensions in the country, at least through the 1973
                            congressional elections. A second result has been the reduction of
                            inter-party strife, particularly within the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss>, and an increase of coordination and cooperation
                            between the major opposition parties, particularly the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PN_1"
                            >PN</gloss>. Paradoxically, however, the third result has been a
                            developing sense of opposition frustration. Political tests during the
                            past year have convinced the opposition that it has the support of the
                            majority of Chileans, but despite this support the opposition has been
                            unable to force the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> government to
                            alter its basic policies. The <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>
                            continues on its announced path of instituting wide ranging changes such
                            as taking over major Chilean industries, while land seizures carried out
                            by the Agrarian Reform Agency (<gloss target="#t_CORA_1">CORA</gloss>)
                            and by revolutionary groups have increased dramatically. The opposition
                            is frustrated by its inability to prevent the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss> from gaining increasing control of the economy, and it
                            is this frustration which has caused many opposition <pb n="586"
                                facs="0626" xml:id="pg_586"/>political leaders to view a military
                            coup as the only means of preventing the imposition of totalitarian
                            state controls on the body politic.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> on the other hand is suffering
                            from economic difficulties. One of the government’s major problems is
                            inflation which has risen 20% in the first four months of 1972. This
                            inflation is causing labor pressures for salary adjustments, and is
                            resulting in union strikes and wildcat work stoppages. The opposition is
                            taking advantage of the discontent which is building up, particularly in
                            southern Chile, to promote a series of rural strikes and to stimulate
                            farm workers and farm owners to resist land seizures. In the organized
                            labor field, the opposition is running a slate in the 30–31 May election
                            in the Chilean Labor Confederation (<gloss target="#t_CUT_1"
                            >CUT</gloss>) which has traditionally been controlled by an alliance of
                            the Communist and Socialist parties. Although the opposition has little
                            or no chance of winning this election, a strong showing by opposition
                            candidates could be widely exploited as a propaganda victory.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d115fn2">Early returns from the <gloss target="#t_CUT_1"

                                    <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> candidates. [Footnote is in
                                the original.]</note> The opposition is also hoping to exacerbate
                            the tensions which have been created within the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss> by Socialist Party efforts to wrest control of the
                                <gloss target="#t_CUT_1">CUT</gloss> from the Communist Party in
                            order to further its own advances in the labor field.</p>
                        <p>A new by-election will probably be held in mid-August 1972 to fill the
                            seat of a Communist Deputy from Coquimbo Province who died on 5 May.
                            Historically Coquimbo has been a strong <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss> district, but voting patterns indicate that the results
                            of a by-election there may be determined by voters who belonged to the
                            Radical Party <gloss target="#t_PR_1">PR</gloss> before the <gloss
                                target="#t_PR_1">PR</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss>
                            split. An opposition victory in Coquimbo is possible if a large
                            percentage of these Radicals vote for the opposition rather than for the
                                <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> candidate, who will probably be a
                            Communist. If a by-election is held, the opposition parties will
                            undoubtedly need to seek funds from us for this difficult campaign.</p>

                        <p>During March and April much of the political activity of the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> focused on the 27 April University of
                            Chile elections. A special report was distributed to the Committee on 12
                            May which described the favorable outcome of these elections. In brief
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Edgardo Boeninger</persName>, the
                            opposition candidate seeking reelection as rector of the university,
                            gained an absolute majority over Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HLF_1">Felipe
                                Herrera</persName>, former president of the Inter-American
                            Development Bank (<gloss target="#t_IADB_1">IADB</gloss>), who was
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s personal candidate
                            and was strongly backed by the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>. In
                            addition, opposition forces won 53 seats on the 100 member university
                            council, and may gain still another seat when all votes have been
                            counted. As a consequence, Rector <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Boeninger</persName> will have a working majority on this body,
                            which prior to the election was controlled by the <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> and was responsible for the university
                            crisis which erupted into violence in October–November 1971.</p>
                        <p>Now that the university election has been won, <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> leaders are concentrating on the upcoming Chilean
                            Student Federation (FECH) elections at the University of Chile which
                            should be held in late May or early June 1972. The fact that Rector
                                <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Boeninger</persName> obtained a majority
                            of the student vote in the April 1972 election (51.7% as contrasted with
                            47.7% in June 1971) has provided impetus to the opposition, which is
                            anxious to push ahead with the FECH election. The current FECH
                            President, a Communist, is attempting to stall the elections until
                            August 1972. <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> student leaders are
                            trying to block these <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> tactics and are
                            also attempting to reach an electoral agreement with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss> in order to increase their prospects for
                            unseating the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> forces which now
                            control the FECH.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>, supported by the <gloss
                                target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss>, has also nominated a slate of
                            candidates in the <gloss target="#t_CUT_1">CUT</gloss> elections, and
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> leaders are hopeful that worker
                            discontent with government policies will result in significant voter
                            support for the opposition slate.</p>
                        <p>On 12 April the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> and other opposition
                            parties staged the much publicized “freedom march” in which a crowd
                            variously estimated up to 250,000 marched to protest government
                            policies. The main speaker at this rally was <persName
                                corresp="#p_AAP_1">Patricio Aylwin</persName>, <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> president of the Senate. Prior to the
                            march the leaders of the opposition parties, including former president
                                <persName corresp="#p_FME_1">Eduardo Frei</persName>, met together
                            with representatives of the business community to discuss plans for the
                            march as well as to exchange ideas for coordinating the opposition
                            effort. This was the first meeting between Frei and other opposition
                            leaders such as <persName corresp="#p_JRSO_1">Sergio Onofre
                                Jarpa</persName>, president of the <gloss target="#t_PN_1"
                                >PN</gloss>, and thus represented an important step toward
                            strengthening the unity of the opposition.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> continued to work toward
                            strengthening its internal party organization, particularly at the
                            community level. Since the last progress report the number of members

                            60,000. The <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> had adopted a number of

                                >PDC</gloss> in the FECH election also. The <gloss target="#t_PN_1"
                                >PN</gloss>’s willingness to subordinate its partisan political

                            of the need for coordinated political action.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss> has taken a special interest in
                            the deteriorating situation in the south of Chile, where a number of
                            issues are pushing farm owners and peasants toward anti-government
                            action. Some 560 farms in the southern provinces have been taken over
                            “legally” by government agencies, but no financial settlements have been
                            made. Hence not only farm owners but also peasants of rural
                            cooperatives, who were promised land which they have never received, are
                            pressing for redress. Cases involving illegal land seizures carried out
                            by revolutionary groups such as the Cuban-supported Movement of the
                            Revolutionary Left (<gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss>) have been
                            taken to court, but legal judgments in favor of the farm owners are not
                            enforced by the government. Threats and intimidations by the <gloss
                                target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> and revolutionary groups, and other
                            grievances have led anti-Marxist forces in the south to seek <gloss
                                target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss> support for strikes and the
                            re-occupation of some farms. These actions are designed to focus public
                            attention on the problems of farmers and peasants. In cooperation with
                            the Small Retailers Association the <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss>
                            has launched a propaganda campaign against the Communist-controlled
                            “Neighborhood Supply and Price Councils” which are permitted to
                            determine the price and control of the distribution of short-supply
                            consumer items. This campaign is now receiving wide publicity in all
                            Chilean media. The retailers are planning a nationwide protest strike,
                            which will be coordinated with similar actions planned by farmers and
                            peasants organizations.</p>

                                >less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]. The <gloss

                            facilities which the party needs for organizational and media purposes.
                            Party leaders are making these purchases partly because the <gloss

                            demonstrate to <gloss target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss> financial supporters
                            that contributions will be put to good use and will not line the pockets
                            of party officials, as was frequently the case with funds donated to the
                            old Radical Party (<gloss target="#t_PR_1">PR</gloss>) leadership.
                            Specific party expenditures include the purchase of Radio Yungay in

                            two small provincial radio stations have been rented for a one-year
                            period. A print shop in Santiago has been purchased and mimeograph
                            machines have been ordered for each of the provincial capitals. The
                            party has also contracted for the services of newspapers in four large
                            provincial cities and is seeking to make similar arrangements with
                            newspapers and radio stations in other key areas. The party also intends
                            to open party offices in key provincial centers and to recruit competent

                        <p>A. During its initial year in office the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> regime made substantial progress towards its
                            revolutionary goals, especially in the social and economic areas. But
                            over the past six months or so the Popular Unity (<gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>) government has been beset by growing
                            problems and pressures, which underscore the basic weaknesses of
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s current position.
                            While <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> still has at his
                            disposal the considerable powers <pb n="592" facs="0632" xml:id="pg_592"
                            />and prestige of his office, he is a minority President ruling through
                            an unwieldy coalition, whose main partners—the Socialists and the
                            Communists—are divided on basic issues. Unrelenting economic problems
                            and sporadic outbursts of political violence have cut into the <gloss

                            among the traditionally apolitical security forces, and strengthened the
                            hand of the political opposition generally.</p>
                        <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> recognizes that his

                            receiving divided counsel: the Socialists advocate measures intended to
                            force the pace of the revolution and cripple the opposition; the
                            Communists support a program intended to “consolidate” the revolution
                            and conciliate moderate forces outside the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"

                            contentious issues with the Christian Democrats, the mainstay of the

                            political stage might try to continue to live with the exist-ing
                            unstable political arrangements—a course which could be sustained for
                            some time by ad hoc adjustments whenever necessary to ease a crisis. We
                            see three main alternative courses of development: (1) forcing the pace
                            of revolution through radicalization and repression; (2) <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s departure from office; (3)
                            slowing the pace of revolution through conciliation and compromise in
                            order to consolidate the gains made so far.</p>
                        <p>D. Forcing the pace of the revolution would mean destroying the political
                            as well as the economic underpinnings of the political opposition. A
                            likely byproduct would be a further worsening of Chile’s relations with
                            the US and an accelerated growth of ties with Communist countries. We
                            believe this to be the least likely alternative development at this
                            juncture. To succeed, it would require either a strong popular mandate
                            for the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government, a
                            policy of repression directed against the political opposition (which
                            controls Congress), or both. There is little chance that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> will be able to score an impressive
                            victory either in the congressional elections scheduled for March 1973
                            or in any special plebiscite. And neither the security forces nor the
                            population at large would be likely to support a policy of systematic
                            repression. In particular, we believe there is almost no chance that
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> could convert the
                            military and the <hi rend="italic">Carabineros</hi> (national police)
                            into pliable instruments for repression.</p>
                        <p>E. Barring an effort by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            at radicalization and repression, the chances of the second
                            alternative—his removal from office over the next year or so—are
                            relatively small. Despite uneasiness about the re<pb n="593" facs="0633"
                                xml:id="pg_593"/>cent course of events in Chile, the security forces
                            do not now appear willing to mount a coup. Their strong tradition is not
                            to become engaged directly in the political process; if forced to
                            intervene they would prefer to apply pressure on the President to
                            moderate his policies, rather than to overthrow him. A vital factor in
                            any decision by the military to intervene would be their perception of
                            the popular consensus at the time. Among the contingencies that would
                            increase the likelihood of action by the military would be a blatantly
                            unconstitutional act by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>,
                            real or threatened breakdown in public order, or threats to the
                            military’s institutional integrity.</p>
                        <p>F. We believe the third alternative is the most likely course over the
                            next year or so—a concerted effort by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> to conciliate the political center and to slow
                            the pace of the revolution. At least in the short run <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is likely to attempt
                            relatively modest steps to reduce the political temperature, by curbing
                            the activities of extremist groups and by securing agreements via
                            compromise on outstanding sensitive issues. The pressures on <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to promote more substantial
                            forms of accommodation would probably increase if the opposition made
                            large gains in the March 1973 election.</p>
                        <p>G. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s objective in
                            pursuing such a course would be to preserve the revolutionary advances
                            already made—not to repudiate them. He would hope to divide the
                            opposition and to move forward with some additional measures that would
                            have the backing of the political center, particularly in the social and
                            economic spheres. The leaders of the political center would be
                            interested in cooperating on selective issues in order to keep the
                            political system sufficiently intact to enable them to compete for an
                            eventual return to office. Any major moves by <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> towards cooperation with the
                            Christian Democrats would probably alienate the extreme left and might
                            cause some defections of hardliners from the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss>. Although the atmosphere of confrontation in the country
                            as a whole would tend to dissipate, at least some extremists associated
                            with the Leftist Revolutionary Movement would turn to systematic
                            violence. The security forces would be likely to cope reasonably well
                            with either guerrilla warfare or urban terrorism.</p>
                        <p>H. Even with moves to slow the pace of the revolution the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government would still face
                            prickly domestic and international problems, particularly in the
                            economic field. We doubt that there would be any sharp changes in
                            Chile’s cordial relations with Communist countries. Nor would <persName

                            conciliation at home be likely to improve his relations with the US
                            dramatically. Moderate groups would probably reinforce <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s tendency to avoid a complete
                            rupture with the US, and might also work to avert a showdown on the
                            issues involving compensation for nationalized US companies. But most
                            Chileans would probably expect the US to be <pb n="594" facs="0634"
                                xml:id="pg_594"/>forthcoming on such issues as debt renegotiations

                        <p>I. The implications for Chile over the longer term of slowing the pace of
                            the revolution would depend on many unknowns and unknowables. It is
                            possible that the revolutionary dynamic might still undermine the
                            country’s democratic tradition. But the chances for an open and
                            meaningful Presidential election in 1976 would probably be considerably
                            improved. Even if <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            continued to move forward with the economic and social goals of his
                            revolution, the democratic political system could still be sustained by
                            such institutions as an independent military, a free press, a vigorous
                            congress, and a politically sophisticated populace.</p>

                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Salvador Allende</persName>’s accession
                            to office as President in November 1970 raised the question of whether
                            his regime would sound the deathknell for Chile’s traditionally
                            democratic political system and Western-oriented foreign policy.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> insisted that
                            Chile’s constitutional system would be respected. The declared goal of
                            his Popular Unity (<gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>) coalition,
                            however, was to build a “revolutionary, nationalistic, and socialist
                            society on Marxist principles”, and spokesmen for the regime stressed
                            the need to make the revolution “irreversible”.</p>
                        <p>2. On the basis of the record so far, Chile’s future course remains to a
                            large extent an open issue. To be sure, the regime carried out a
                            substantial part of its program during its first year, particularly in
                            the economic area. With little effective opposition—indeed, in many
                            cases with a broad consensus—<persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> nationalized key economic sectors, redistributed
                            income in favor of the poorer classes, and accelerated land
                            expropriation. He appeared to be well on the way to crippling his
                            political opposition by destroying its economic base. In foreign
                            relations, expropriation (so far without effective compensation) of US
                            holdings in Chilean copper abruptly uncoupled the former close links
                            with the US, while ties with Communist countries, large and small,
                            proliferated.</p>
                        <p>3. During the past half year, however, both the problems engendered by
                            the regime’s policies and the pressures against these policies by
                            antagonistic political forces have sharpened markedly. One key to the
                            turn-about in <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            political fortunes has been the worsening economic situation; growing
                            shortages of consumer goods, mounting inflation, and acute stringencies
                            in foreign exchange have presented the political opposition with an
                            effective vehicle for mobilizing anti-government sentiment. Thus far in
                            1972 the government’s claim to represent the popular will has suffered
                            several sharp setbacks: in January, <pb n="595" facs="0635"
                                xml:id="pg_595"/>with the loss of two key congressional
                            by-elections; in April, with the victory of the opposition candidate in
                            the hard-fought election for control of the University of Chile; and in
                            June, with the strong showing of the opposition candidate in the
                            balloting for control of a bastion of <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>
                            support—the national labor confederation.</p>
                        <p>4. To some extent, the stiffening opposition to <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has been both symptom and
                            cause of an increasing resort to political violence. Antagonistic groups
                            have turned to coercion and force to settle directly the issues between
                            them. Farms have been seized by armed groups representing the extreme
                            left and, in turn, by the displaced farmers, while urban disorders have
                            followed in the wake of partisan demonstrations. The increased use of
                            inflammatory invective by politicians from all camps underscores the
                            growing political polarization. Charges by the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss> that the opposition is engaged in “fascist sedition” are
                            countered by allegations that the government is bent on imposing
                            “Marxist totalitarianism” in Chile. Mounting tensions, coupled with
                            unresolved constitutional conflicts about the extent of executive
                            authority, have caused some Chilean politicians to conjure up the
                            spectre of civil war. This in itself has raised the level of
                            apprehension among Chile’s traditionally apolitical armed forces.</p>
                        <p>5. But even while these strains on the Chilean body politic grow more
                            obvious, the traditional political system continues to demonstrate a
                            remarkable resiliency. Legislative, student, and trade union elections
                            take place in normal fashion, with pro-government forces accepting the
                            results when they are adverse. Opposition news media have resisted
                            government intimidation and persist in denouncing the government, often
                            in vitriolic terms. The government apparently holds no <hi rend="italic"
                                >political</hi> prisoners, and the numbers of casualties from the
                            reported violence are very small. Most important, in keeping with
                            Chilean political practice, government and opposition leaders continue
                            to engage in behind-the-scenes bargaining to accommodate the differences
                            they publicly declare to be irreconcilable. Despite growing concern over
                            the course of events, most military leaders still are committed to the
                            constitutional system and hopeful that the politicians will somehow
                            resolve the political crises short of civil war or other disaster.</p>
                        <p>6. The foregoing rundown underscores the inherent complexity of the
                            unfolding political scene in Chile and the difficulty of assessing the
                            future course of events, especially over the longer term. This Estimate
                            discusses the nature of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                            >Allende</persName>’s alternatives over the next year or so, and some of

                            political system and its relations with the US and other nations. We
                            think that what happens during the next year, including the
                            congressional elections scheduled for March 1973 and the political

                            reversing himself when necessary. On other occasions, however, he would
                            deal with a sensitive issue by presenting the Communists and Socialists

                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s “Ceasar Complex”,
                            but were left with little choice but to accept the President’s
                            action.</p>
                        <p>8. Over the past six months, however, there has been a marked shift in
                            the situation. As the problems and pressures have grown, the weaknesses
                            of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s position as the
                            head of a minority coalition of disparate and often conflicting forces
                            have become more obvious. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> has shown uncertainty in reacting to the
                            stepped-up pressures of the opposition; rather than skillfully
                            manipulating the components of his motley coalition, he has appeared to
                            be more and more boxed-in by their obstinacy. Thus, in January, when
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> reshuffled his
                            Cabinet after the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> losses in the
                            congressional by-election, he apparently felt constrained to bow to the
                            demands of both key parties that there be no alteration in the size of
                            their ministerial representation. This blocked <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> from instituting the more
                            sweeping cabinet reorganization he seemed to be contemplating at that
                            time. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s efforts to
                            readjust his political tactics to cope with the pressures mounting
                            against him have also been frustrated by sharpening conflicts within his
                            coalition.</p>
                        <p>9. The key elements of the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> have
                            managed to hold together despite increasing strains. The one defection
                            so far has been that of the politically-moderate Leftist Radical Party
                                (<gloss target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss>). There have been various
                            internal splits and realignments affecting the mini-parties of the
                            coalition, but the major problems have reflected differences between the
                            Communists and the Socialists. These have involved issues of the pace of
                            the revolution and the degree of adherence to legality and <pb n="597"

                            uniformly taking the more cautious positions. The differences on
                            strategy and tactics have at times been exacerbated by partisan
                            competitiveness. Nonetheless, both parties have an enormous stake in the
                            survival and success of the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> government, which so far has moved them to keep
                            interparty tensions and conflicts within bounds.</p>

                        <p>11. Although scornful of the parliamentary path to socialism, the <gloss

                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> in 1970. The <gloss

                                >Allende</persName>’s personal security force. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, for his part, freed members
                            of the <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> imprisoned under Frei and

                            the rhetoric and actions of the <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss>
                            have placed this accord in jeopardy. Repeated attacks on both <persName

                            compromising the revolution (e.g., by respecting “bourgeois-democratic
                            institutionalism”) have served to sour <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss>–MIR relations. Illegal seizures of farms, factories, and

                                >MIR</gloss> have been a major embarrassment to <persName

                        <p>12. The MIR’s revolutionary rhetoric and actions have already proved
                            costly to the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>. Middle class and women
                            voters are alienated by the MIR’s predilection for illegality and
                            violence and tend to identify the Movement with the government. This
                            identification was costly to the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> in
                            the January 1972 by-elections. Most important, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and the Communists, and at
                            times even some Socialists, fear that the MIR’s illegal activities and
                            the accompanying violence may provoke a military intervention.</p>
                        <p>13. The <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> long has been anathema to
                            the Chilean Communists. This animosity has stemmed in part from rivalry
                            for the allegiance of leftist Chileans, particularly the youth.

                            slum dwellers, and in some labor unions have heightened the

                            relations between the dominant radical wing of the Socialist Party and
                            the Movement have been close. Both groups share a commitment to
                            accelerating the pace of the revolution and a belief that violence
                            ultimately will be necessary to achieve socialism. Thus, Socialist
                            leaders have until recently avoided criticizing the MIR. In May 1972,
                            when disorders in Concepcion provoked mainly by the <gloss
                                target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> threatened to cause major damage to
                            the government, the Secretary General of the Socialist Party did so, but
                            it is not clear how widely he was supported within the Party.</p>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> frequently has
                            deplored the MIR’s violence-provoking activities, but so far has been
                            averse to cracking down on the organization. His circumspection has a
                            number of causes. The close links between members of his own Socialist
                            Party and the MIR—some are believed to have dual membership—evoke
                            concern lest repression of the organization lead to a schism in the
                            Party. Moreover, he prefers to view the Movement as a group of
                            idealistic, but misguided youth. At the same time <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> probably recognizes the
                            contributions of the <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> to the
                            security of his regime; the organization has penetrated conspiratorial
                            right-wing groups, and warned the government of plots to depose
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. Finally, if an
                            armed showdown with the opposition should develop, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> may be counting on the <gloss

                        <p>15. Despite these considerations, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> undoubtedly would consider moving against the
                                <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> if he felt that he had no
                            alternative to fend off military intervention or to avoid serious
                            electoral damage. His efforts to persuade the Movement to exercise
                            restraint have been fruitless so far. There is little ground for
                            supposing that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            attempts to incorporate the <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> into

                            Indeed, the trend is toward greater hostility between the <gloss

                            the two major opposition parties, the moderately leftist Christian
                            Democratic Party (<gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>) and the

                            including its tolerance of the MIR’s illegal activities.</p>
                        <p>17. Initially, most Christian Democrats were receptive to a policy of

                            privileged classes. In keeping with Chilean political traditions, the

                            Executive to reduce the strength of the political opposition and in fact
                            was out to destroy it.</p>

                            relations are marked by considerable distrust. Leaders of the <gloss

                            have little in common with the conservative Nationals other than a
                            shared concern over the future of Chilean democracy. For their part, the
                            Nationals suspect that the Christian Democrats remain receptive to
                            overtures from <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> for
                            cooperation with the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>, despite past
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> disappointments on this score.
                            The Nationals probably resent the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>’s
                            public stress on the broad ideological gulf that separates the two
                            parties. Unlike the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>, however, the
                                <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss> presently has no feasible
                            alternative to collaboration. If the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                            alliance breaks up, it is likely to occur at the initiative of the
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>. Indeed, the recent defection
                            of the <gloss target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss> from the government has
                            raised fears among the Nationals of a possible center-left coalition
                            between the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_PIR_1">PIR</gloss> which would exclude the <gloss

                        <p>19. To a large extent the future shape of the opposition may be dictated
                            by events over which it has only limited control. If political
                            polarization continues so that growing numbers of Chileans come to
                            regard each other as irreconcilable enemies, this would contribute to
                            the maintenance of a united, if heterogeneous opposition. On the other
                            hand, if <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> strives to cool
                            the political atmosphere, overrides the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"

                            within that party and between opposition parties would probably come to

                            from the belief that the outcome of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s trafficking with the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"

                            opposition. In April 1972, for example, the Socialists undermined a
                            negotiated compromise between <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> and the opposition under which the legislature
                            would have the authority to slow the pace of nationalization of private
                            enterprises. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> was forced
                            to back off and assert that the executive authority to nationalize
                            private firms could not be infringed by Congress. This provoked great
                            bitterness within the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> and was the
                            immediate cause of the defection of the <gloss target="#t_PIR_1"
                                >PIR</gloss> from the government. Intense disagreements between the

                            of executive versus legislative prerogatives led to talk on both sides

                                23,000). The Armed Forces have experienced some erosion of

                            concerned, nevertheless, about the prospect of a breakdown in public

                        <p>22. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and his associates
                            are aware that the security forces represent a major potential threat to
                            the survival of the regime. Indeed, since taking office <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has gone to great lengths to
                            court them: e.g., by demonstrating his personal interest in such matters
                            as increases in pay, perquisites, and equipment; by playing a prominent
                            role at military ceremonies; and by including flattering references to
                            the military and the police in his speeches. More recently, he has been
                            making a conspicuous effort to involve the military in his
                            administration. An Army general served briefly as Minister of Mines and
                            officers serve on the directing boards of expropriated enterprises and
                            as chief administrative officials in some provinces.</p>

                        <p>23. In spite of these efforts the dissatisfaction of the security forces
                            with the regime has grown, and the military recently demonstrated their
                            desire to remain aloof by turning down <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s offer of several Cabinet posts. To some extent
                            this phenomenon is related to the same factors that have eroded the
                            regime’s support among civilians. Like other Chileans, men in uniform
                            are disturbed by shortages of consumer goods and by rising inflation.
                            They are concerned in particular that the policies of the regime are
                            accelerating the polarization of Chilean society and leading to a
                            breakdown of public order.<note n="5" xml:id="d116fn5">Military and

                                firing teargas at the protesting housewives. [Footnote is in the
                                original.]</note> And the verbal brinkmanship by government and
                            opposition politicians emphasizing the threat of civil war adds to the
                            disquiet of the military and the police. The security forces also have
                            reacted to developments of particular concern to them. The regime’s
                            toleration of the MIR’s antics has played a major part in fuelling
                            discontent, especially among the <hi rend="italic">Carabineros,</hi> who
                            have generally been enjoined from halting even patently illegal <gloss

                            also disturbed by reports that the government is abetting the arming of
                                <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> supporters, that it is doing
                            nothing to check the proliferation of illegal armed groups, and that the

                            intent upon infiltrating the armed forces.</p>
                        <p>24. Despite uneasiness about the recent course of events in Chile, the
                            security forces do not now appear willing to mount a coup. A number of
                            soundings have apparently produced only highly-qualified commitments to
                            action, mostly because the coup-minded officers have not been able to
                            demonstrate that a popular consensus would support a coup or that there
                            are no alternatives to the ouster of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>. In fact the recent political successes of the
                            opposition have fostered a belief among military leaders that it is
                            possible to keep <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> in
                            check by legal methods. Nor have they concluded (as their counterparts
                            did in Brazil in 1964 and Peru in 1968) that Chilean politicians as a
                            class are hopelessly inept, venal, or subversive and that the military
                            are the only force capable of saving the nation from imminent ruin.
                            Furthermore, many officers believe that the military can, if necessary,
                            successfully exert pressure on the President to moderate his policies.
                            This course would be far more palatable to most Chilean officers than a
                            coup, because it would not entail a dramatic departure from the armed
                            forces’ constitutionalist tradition or threaten their institutional
                            unity.</p>
                        <p>25. There are, nonetheless, certain contingencies that could produce a
                            fairly rapid growth in sentiment to intervene in some fashion. A real or
                            threatened breakdown in public order could politicize the mili<pb

                            especially if the military or police were to suffer a number of
                            casualties at the hands of extremist groups. So would a perception of a
                            major threat to the armed forces as an institution. One possible
                            catalyst would be the strengthening of illegal armed groups to the point
                            where the security forces feared that they were in peril of losing their
                            ability to suppress them. Another would be fear that the forces of
                            polarization that affect the society at large were causing deep
                            divisions in the military as well.<note n="6" xml:id="d116fn6">It is
                                difficult to weigh the current importance of this consideration
                                mainly because there is a dearth of information on the attitudes
                                toward the regime of junior officers, <gloss target="#t_non-com_1"
                                    >non-coms</gloss>, and enlisted men. [Footnote is in the

                            play a prime part in determining its form. The armed forces share the
                            national heritage of respect for legality and constitutional order, and
                            would not want to be held culpable for destroying this legacy. In a
                            crisis, therefore, the security forces would probably first try to exert
                            heavy pressure on <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to
                            force changes in personnel and policies, to defuse the crisis, and to
                            foster a return to order. Such action would represent a sharp break with
                            recent Chilean political practice, but the constitution would remain
                            technically inviolate.</p>
                        <p>27. Under certain circumstances the security forces would probably
                            overcome their strong reservations about direct political involvement. A
                            vital factor in any military intervention would be the military’s
                            perception of a popular consensus supporting a move on their part. If
                            rapidly escalating violence appeared to open up the prospect of civil
                            war, the military would probably take over to avert a bloodbath. Indeed,
                            in this case <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> might, and
                            public opinion presumably would, invite such action. Similarly, a threat
                            to the constitutional system from the government or from extremists
                            outside the government might move the security forces to act.</p>

                        <p>28. The decline in <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            political fortunes has in good part been caused by the worsening
                            economic situation. During his first year in office <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> scored signal successes in
                            reviving a sluggish economy, in raising the personal income and
                            consumption of the poorer classes, and in extending state controls over
                            the private sector. His policies, however, consistently emphasized
                            consumption and the expansion of state controls at the expense of
                            capital investment and, ultimately, production. By late 1971 personal
                            incomes were running far ahead of the supply of consumer goods. The
                            result was accelerated inflation and widespread shortages of consumer
                            goods, especially of meat but also of such important items as clothing
                            and medicines.</p>
                        <pb n="603" facs="0643" xml:id="pg_603"/>
                        <p>29. The political opposition is blaming the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> regime for these developments, apparently with
                            some success. Especially among housewives, economic difficulties have
                            been transferred into political complaints and have helped swell the
                            mass rallies and vote tallies of the opposition. To be sure, Chileans
                            are accustomed to high rates of inflation and sporadic shortages of
                            goods, and the poorer classes are almost certainly consuming more in
                            1972 than in 1970. What is new is the frustration caused by shortages
                            coming in the immediate aftermath of a consumer boom fostered and
                            acclaimed by the government.</p>
                        <p>30. Although stringent economic hardships are not likely to occur, there
                            seems to be little that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            can do to relieve the pressures on consumer supplies and prices over the
                            next year or so. In fact the rate of price increase is accelerating and
                            the rise for the year is likely to be far greater than the officially
                            reported 22 percent increase in 1971. The decline in agricultural
                            investment and the rise in rural disorders will continue to depress food
                            production (a decline of about 10 percent is likely in 1972).
                            Manufacturing output, which was a key source of growth in 1971, is
                            levelling off; production capacity now is largely utilized and little
                            new investment is forthcoming.</p>
                        <p>31. A thorny balance of payments problem constrains the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime from covering domestic
                            supply shortages through imports as readily as it did in 1971. Net
                            foreign reserves, which stood at a record $378 million when <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> was elected in September 1970,
                            plummeted to a negative balance by early 1972. This reflects in part a
                            doubling of food imports, but also a drop of nearly 20 percent during
                            1971 in earnings from copper exports and continuing outflows of capital.
                            Chile’s problem is sharply complicated by a very heavy schedule of debt
                            repayment. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> relieved the
                            pressure in November 1971 by imposing a moratorium on debt service
                            payments. Then in April 1972, after protracted negotiations, Chile
                            concluded a general rescheduling agreement with the US and other
                            principal creditor nations covering the period from November 1971
                            through 1972. Chile, as a practical matter, has already received the
                            bulk of the debt relief agreed to because it has continued the
                            moratorium until bilateral agreements are signed.</p>
                        <p>32. Assistance from Communist countries, including a $50 million hard
                            currency credit from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, also
                            provides a measure of relief, as do various short-term trade agreements
                            with food-exporting countries such as Argentina and New Zealand.
                            Long-term and short-term credits from several Latin American countries
                            totalling more than $100 million also appear in the offing. These steps
                            will probably enable <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to
                            maintain consumer imports at high levels and perhaps increase them
                            temporarily for political purposes (e.g., just before the 1973
                            election). But because of rising consumer demand and the decline in <pb
                                n="604" facs="0644" xml:id="pg_604"/>domestic production, the regime
                            cannot resolve the growing imbalances between supply and demand at home
                            and between receipts and payments abroad. This would require a sharp
                            reorientation of domestic priorities from consumption to investment and
                            productivity, and a sizable expansion as well either in exports or
                            foreign loans.</p>
                        <p>33. For political reasons, it is doubtful that major curbs on
                            consumption—e.g., across-the-board rationing or wage controls—will be
                            undertaken before the March 1973 election. Various partial controls have
                            been instituted (e.g., beef may be sold only three days per week), but
                            the regime finds it more palatable to let inflation accelerate than to
                            impose the hard measures needed to check it. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has repeatedly admonished
                            workers to exercise self-restraint in their wage demands and to push for
                            greater productivity, but so far the Chilean proletariat has shown
                            little inclination to cooperate. To avoid costly strikes (particularly
                            in the copper mines), the government generally has gone a long way
                            towards meeting worker demands for large increases in wages.</p>
                        <p>34. Investment in the private sector will almost certainly remain at
                            greatly depressed levels so long as the government continues its assault
                            on private ownership. Government investment may partially compensate for
                            the decline of private investment, but much of the expenditure by the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime will be
                            related to welfare and consumption (e.g., housing) and will affect
                            production only indirectly and over the long term. Any major
                            breakthrough in foreign private investment or governmental aid is likely
                            to be conditioned on evidence that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> is willing to make the hard decisions on
                            restraining consumption and imports, while boosting productive
                            investments and exports. In fact the major creditor nations have called
                            for some evidence of improved financial management as one condition for
                            any rescheduling of Chilean debt repayments falling due in 1973.</p>
                        <p>35. A sharp boost in earnings from copper exports would relieve pressures
                            to some degree, but prospects here are uncertain. Production is likely
                            to continue to be hampered by poor management, worker indiscipline, and
                            inadequate maintenance of equipment, although some increase is likely
                            because of the expansion program of recent years. Copper prices are
                            notoriously volatile (the average price dropped about 23 percent in
                            1971) and attempts at prognostication hazardous. But a rise of 5 percent
                            or so in average prices for 1972 appears to be a reasonable estimate.
                            With an increase of about 5 percent in prices and a small increase in
                            output, Chile’s foreign exchange earnings from copper would grow in 1972
                            by some $50–$70 million. A rise in earnings in this range would do
                            relatively little to solve the pressures against Chile’s balance of
                            payments. The payments deficit for 1971 was around $400 million,
                            including $200 million on current account. Since there no <pb n="605"
                                facs="0645" xml:id="pg_605"/>longer is a cushion of foreign reserves
                            and since the attitude of major creditors is at best cautious, Chile
                            will face increasingly severe import constraints. In so far as <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> continues to emphasize
                            maintaining a high level of consumer imports, production and investment
                            will continue to suffer.</p>

                        <p>36. So far <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has met with
                            greater success in managing Chile’s foreign relations than he has in
                            coping with its domestic problems. For the most part, he has pursued a
                            cautious, independent course, striving to keep his options open. Links
                            with the Communist world have expanded steadily but unspectacularly.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has taken care to
                            assure that these new ties do not jeopardize his relations with his
                            South American neighbors or with the industrial states he depends on for
                            trade and credits. And mindful of US influence on international credit
                            sources and of Chile’s requirement for specialized US equipment,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has sought to avoid
                            irreparable damage to his relations with Washington.</p>
                        <p>37. For a number of reasons the expansion of relations between Chile and
                            the Communist states has been slower than might have been anticipated.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is publicly
                            committed to a policy of non-alignment, and would not like to be
                            excessively dependent on any power bloc. Furthermore, he recognizes
                            Chile’s continuing need for non-Communist credits, equipment,
                            technology, and markets for copper. The difficulties inherent in forging
                            new economic links between Chile and Communist nations are manifested in
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s slowness in
                            utilizing the nearly $90 million in long-term credits proffered by the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> over the years. The recent
                            sale of 5,000 Soviet tractors represents the first substantial
                            utilization of long-term Soviet credits.<note n="7" xml:id="d116fn7"

                        <p>38. A further obstacle to a substantial increase in ties with Communist
                            states has been the position of the Chilean military regarding a Soviet
                            offer of military credits. So far at least, military officers have
                            successfully resisted the acquisition of any weaponry that would require
                            either the presence of Soviet military advisers in Chile or the dispatch
                            of Chileans to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> for training.
                            They apparently are not as resistant to accepting less sophisticated
                            equipment from Moscow that would not require Soviet advisers or
                            extensive training.</p>
                        <p>39. Although the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> considers the
                            advent of the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime an
                            important step forward in the erosion of US hegemony over Latin America,
                            the Soviet attitude toward the regime has been characterized <pb n="606"
                                facs="0646" xml:id="pg_606"/>by caution and restraint. To be sure,
                            Moscow expresses <hi rend="italic">pro forma</hi> sympathy and support
                            for Chile’s struggle to achieve “independence” and implement
                            “progressive” changes, but references to the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss> as a government striving to achieve socialism are
                            scrupulously avoided. This caution reflects a variety of concerns,
                            including doubts about <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            political staying power and his ability to apply the necessary tough
                            measures needed to straighten out the economy. Moreover, the Soviets
                            probably are reluctant to antagonize the US by pushing too rapidly for
                            influence in Chile, and in any case they presumably want to avoid the
                            open-ended commitments for aid they entered into with Cuba.</p>
                        <p>40. Political, economic, and cultural relations between Chile and Cuba
                            have expanded considerably, as highlighted by <persName

                            move to oust <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. Havana has
                            been circumspect about trying to use Chile as a base for promoting
                            revolutionary movements elsewhere in Latin America, partly so as not to
                            add to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s problems and
                            partly so as not to jeopardize the advantages offered by the Cuban
                            presence in Santiago. Cuban officials in Chile are involved in assisting
                            Latin American revolutionaries exiled in or transiting through Chile,
                            but on a fairly modest scale.</p>
                        <p>41. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has sought to
                            maintain cordial ties with other Latin American states through a
                            judicious mix of personal diplomacy and rhetoric contrived to calm fears
                            about the appearance of a Marxist-led government on their doorstep. He
                            has gone to great lengths to convince his South American neighbors that
                            he does not share <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel Castro</persName>’s
                            revolutionary messianism and that Chile will not become a major base for
                            subversive activities against them. Would-be revolutionaries resident in
                            Chile (particularly Bolivians) do receive some arms, funds, and other
                            support in Chile, probably from the <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss>
                            and from extremists in the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>. Some of
                            this activity occurs with <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s knowledge, but probably not at his behest. The
                            target countries are unhappy about even this low level of help to
                            subversives, but generally speaking <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s good neighbor policy has not suffered serious
                            damage from these activities.</p>
                        <p>42. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has been ambivalent
                            in his dealings with the US. The major problem roiling relations
                            continues to be that of compensation for the nationalization of US
                            companies. Last September, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> ruled that $774 million in “excess profits”
                            would be deducted from any compensation due the two major US copper
                            companies. This decision is under review by a special tribunal, but
                            significant compensation to the companies appears unlikely. The
                            pressures from within the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> to continue
                            a hard line on such matters were recently demonstrated by the proposed
                            legislation <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> sent to
                            Congress for expropriation of <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> ’s
                            Chilean holdings; the terms appear likely to exclude satisfactory <pb
                                n="607" facs="0647" xml:id="pg_607"/>compensation. To demonstrate
                            Chilean reasonableness, however, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> has indicated that he might agree to submit the
                            copper question to the lengthy process of international arbitration
                            after Chilean legal remedies have been exhausted. Additional options
                            open to him would include (a) a barter-type arrangement for the sale of
                            copper at a discount to the affected companies and (b) directing the
                            special tribunal to reduce the various deductions, thus yielding
                            compensation. He has also taken a more flexible position on paying some
                            debts owed to the copper companies which were contracted by the Frei
                            government, and on the possibility of a compromise settlement on the
                                <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> case. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has a definite incentive to be
                            more forthcoming; he wants to gain support from the US and other
                            creditors, both for further relief from debt payments and for new
                            credits.</p>
                        <p>43. Apart from the hard line he has taken with respect to compensation
                            and debt repayment to US companies, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> has sought to prevent a drastic deterioration of
                            US-Chilean relations. He is anxious to maintain access to US equipment
                            and spare parts, and to keep US credit channels open. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is also concerned about
                            avoiding the onus for a breakoff of relations because he is aware of the
                            importance the Chilean military attaches to maintaining links with the
                            US. Consequently, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has
                            taken pains publicly to stress his desire for amicable relations. In
                            conversations with US officials, he often cites such actions as Chile’s
                            continued participation in the <gloss target="#t_UNITAS_1"
                                >UNITAS</gloss> maneuvers with US Navy units and continued
                            hospitality to the US Peace Corps as evidence of good will.</p>

                        <p>44. The preceding sections have underscored the basic weaknesses of
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s position at this
                            juncture. He is a minority President who has not greatly broadened his
                            constituency since taking office and who appears to be losing support in
                            such former <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> strongholds as the trade
                            unions and the university community. His coalition is an unwieldy one,
                            and it is divided on key issues. He still has at his disposal the
                            considerable powers and prestige of the presidency, but he cannot
                            undertake major initiatives without fear of repudiation either by his
                            own coalition or by the political opposition, the military, and the
                            population at large.</p>
                        <p>45. Despite the polarization that has already taken place, efforts at
                            conciliation between the government and the opposition continue. These
                            efforts attest to the remarkable resiliency of the Chilean political
                            system, and to the premium it places on political compromise. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and the men who lead the major
                            political parties are successful products of the system, and they have a
                            shared stake in its perpetua<pb n="608" facs="0648" xml:id="pg_608"
                            />tion. At one or another time, each has savored the fruits of power,
                            and today’s “outs” apparently remain convinced that the system offers
                            them a reasonable prospect of becoming tomorrow’s “ins”. Most of the
                            leaders also see that some degree of accommodation is needed to avert a
                            civil war or a military coup.</p>
                        <p>46. The question remains, however, as to how much pressure the Chilean
                            system of accommodative politics can tolerate. Extremists of the left
                            and right hold it in low esteem and appear to be spoiling for a decisive
                            confrontation which they trust will settle the issue of Chile’s
                            political future to their satisfaction. Their activities have already
                            led to political violence in the countryside and the cities, which has
                            disturbed the security forces. Furthermore, there is the danger that
                            politicians generally may become captives of their own inflammatory
                            rhetoric, and succumb to fears that their opponents are out to
                            annihilate them politically and destroy Chile’s democratic institutions
                            in the process.</p>
                        <p>47. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and most <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> leaders are well aware of their mounting
                            problems and of the growth over the past year of pressures against the
                            political system generally. Increasingly, they see their government in a
                            crisis which requires decisions that could determine the survival and
                            success of the regime over the long run. Recently the parties of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> met to discuss the problems
                            facing the coalition and to lay out a strategy for the future.
                            Originally scheduled for two days, the meetings lasted for over two
                            weeks. The Communists, true to form, advocated a cautious
                            strategy—consolidation of the revolutionary gains already registered,
                            scrupulous avoidance of illegality, condemnation of violence, and
                            cooperation with the political center. The Socialists, in contrast,
                            advocated a radical course of pushing ahead with measures to cripple the
                            opposition through revolutionary changes in the legislative and legal
                            systems, through a speed-up in expropriations of private enterprises and
                            farms, and through new programs to capture the positive support of the
                            poorest classes. The Communist rebuttal may have stressed the risk of a
                            military coup or civil war; the Socialist rejoinder undoubtedly
                            condemned selling out the revolution to its enemies.</p>
                        <p>48. With the announcement on 17 June of a reorganization of his Cabinet,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has taken definite
                            though limited steps in the direction advocated by the Communists: i.e.,
                            towards slowing the pace of the revolution and compromise with the
                            political opposition in order to consolidate the gains made so far.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> stated that formal
                            talks were underway between the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> and
                            the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>, and indicated that he would
                            outline the specifics of any agreement and would discuss prospective
                            changes in the direction of his economic policy at an early date. At the
                            same time he appeared to mollify the Socialists by giving them an
                            additional Cabinet post and by insisting that the government would
                            continue to move ahead on various parts of the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss> program.</p>
                        <pb n="609" facs="0649" xml:id="pg_609"/>
                        <p>49. At this point neither the details nor the full implications of
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s recent initiatives
                            are clear. Strong pressures on the President from the hard-line
                            Socialists, combined with pressures on the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> from its more conservative elements and from the
                            National Party, may cause a collapse of any tentative agreements already
                            reached. Or the two parties to the bargain could fail to agree on the
                            fine points. If the movement towards compromise failed for one or
                            another reason, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and the
                            other key actors on the Chilean political stage might try to continue to
                            live with the unstable political conditions which produced the present
                            crisis. In this manner, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            would hope to hold all the present elements of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> together and to keep the political
                            confrontation and violence within bounds. He would be buying time, in
                            the hope that he could find an issue or an opportunity that would enable
                            him to re-establish the momentum of his first year in office. The other
                            key actors, in and out of the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>, might
                            also agree to live with the present tensions in hopes that the momentum
                            of events would strengthen their position while weakening that of their
                            adversaries. Thus the existing fragile political arrangements could be
                            sustained for some time by various ad hoc adjustments, including
                            behind-the-scenes meetings by leaders of antagonistic forces whenever
                            necessary to ease a crisis.</p>
                        <p>50. We believe there are three main alternative courses of development:
                            forcing the pace of the revolution through radicalization and
                            repression; slowing it through conciliation and compromise in order to
                            consolidate the gains made so far; the departure of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> from office. Any of these
                            developments could result from an initiative by <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>; he might weigh the costs and
                            risks and decide to move. The change could also be imposed on the
                            President either by pressures from the military, with or without the
                            support of an aggressive opposition, or by pressures from within the
                                <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>. Finally, some dramatic event
                            could force the change—such as an abortive military coup, a bloodbath
                            involving partisan rivals, or a shoot-out between an extremist group and
                            the security forces.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic"/>B. <hi rend="italic">Forcing the Pace of the
                                Revolution</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>51. Forcing the pace of the revolution would mean, in effect, adopting
                            the proposals of the hard-line Socialists. It would involve such
                            measures as the imposition of a unicameral “people’s” legislature,
                            control of the press, and final destruction of the economic bases of the
                            middle-class political opposition. One underlying objective would
                            probably be the perpetuation of <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> rule
                            beyond 1976. A likely by-product would be a worsening of Chile’s
                            relations with the US and an accelerated growth of ties with Communist
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>52. We believe this to be the least likely alternative development at
                            this juncture. To succeed, it would require either a strong popular

                            or via the March 1973 congressional elections), a policy of systematic
                            repression against the political opposition, or both. The probable need
                            for repression is almost certainly one factor which makes <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> reluctant to attempt a more
                            radical course. He realizes that neither the security forces nor the
                            population at large would be likely to support systematic repression. At
                            the least, he would have to neutralize the security forces before
                            undertaking such a course; we believe he would have almost no chance of
                            converting the military and the <hi rend="italic">Carabineros</hi>, as

                        <p>53. Nevertheless, there are a number of contingencies under which
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> might move to

                            advocate a plebiscite prior to the 1973 elections as a means of

                            electorate, and partly because the tide of public opinion appears to be
                            against the government. For these reasons we think that <persName

                            Even if the government won a referendum, an attempt to use the results

                            from constitutional form would carry a high risk of a violent reaction

                        <p>54. A decisive triumph by the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> in the
                            March 1973 congressional election (i.e., the capture of a majority of
                            both houses) would be regarded by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> as a popular mandate for radicalizing the
                            revolution. In this case, the opposition would be deprived of legal
                            means to check the initiatives of the government. The <gloss

                            Chile’s remarkably elastic constitution. In such circumstances, the

                            would be the prospect that radical measures would touch off last-ditch
                            violent resistance by some groups, which might indirectly generate
                            military intervention.</p>

                        <p>55. The lineups and precise issues for the 1973 election are not yet set,
                            and may not be until the end of the year. But even at this early
                            juncture the chances that the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>, as
                            presently constituted, will capture control of Congress seem slim. This
                            would probably require a sharp improvement in the economic situation and
                            a reversal of the trend toward political violence, and perhaps also a
                            successful manipulation of the issue of nationalism against the US or
                            some other foreign enemy. In fact we see the elections—which will cover
                            the entire Chamber of Deputies and one-half of the Senate—more as a
                            threat to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s political
                            holdings than as an opportunity for gains. There is a possibility that
                            the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> will pick up some additional
                            seats, but it is more likely that the opposition will either hold its
                            own or make moderate advances.</p>
                        <p>56. Of course, if <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> were to
                            force the pace of the revolution without a popular mandate, the need for
                            repression would be greater and so would the risk of major civil
                            conflict and of a military coup. Yet, under certain conditions,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> might be persuaded
                            by his more radical supporters that the level of risk was acceptable.
                            For example, if there were an abortive <hi rend="italic"
                            >Putsch</hi>—particularly one in which prominent opposition politicians
                            or representatives of the US Government could be implicated—<persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> might conclude that he could
                            justify repression and radical measures on the grounds that they were
                            necessary for the survival of constitutional government. By tarring his
                            opponents as seditionists and foreign agents bent on destroying Chile’s
                            cherished constitutional system, he might be in a strong position to
                            intimidate the opposition and neutralize the military. Finally,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> might move forward
                            in desperation, to fend off what he perceived as an imminent threat to
                            his tenure from the military or the opposition. But again, unless the
                            security forces were split or seriously compromised (e.g., by evidence
                            of foreign intrigue), <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            would have almost no chance of succeeding.</p>

                        <p>57. Barring an effort by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            at radicalization and repression, we judge the chances of his removal
                            from office over the next year or two to be relatively small. For one
                            thing, most Chileans—civilians and military, leaders and followers—would
                            strongly prefer to see constitutional continuity. We have already
                            mentioned some contingencies under which the military might oust
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>—the threat of civil
                            war, an unconstitutional seizure of dictatorial power by <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, or the undermining of the
                            military as an institution. Aside from a move by the military, a major
                            defeat for <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> in the March
                            1973 election could pave the way for his successful impeachment. This
                            would require a two-thirds vote in the Senate, and although the
                            opposition might gain the several seats needed for such a margin, not
                            all opposition senators would be anxious or willing to force <persName

                        <p>58. An overwhelming repudiation by the electorate in the 1973 election or
                            in a plebiscite could conceivably cause <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> to renounce his office. He might also give up

                            in a major initiative, or if civil war threatened. But there is little
                            indication that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has lost
                            either his zest for politics or his strong attachment to office.</p>
                        <p>59. The consequences of so drastic a political event as <persName

                            spark a major insurgency. Certain leftist extremists would probably turn

                        </p>
                        <p>60. We think the most likely course over the next year or so will be
                            moves by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> towards slowing
                            the pace of the revolution in order to accommodate the opposition and to
                            preserve the gains already registered. As indicated in paragraph 48,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has recently taken
                            some tentative steps in this direction. We believe that if he does not
                            succeed at this juncture, he will undertake subsequent initiatives
                            toward the same end. These might take a number of forms. At one end of
                            the spectrum, they would involve mainly tactical moves to ease the
                            confrontation similar to those adverted to by <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> after the <gloss

                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would pledge to seek
                            agreements with the political center on some issues; he would also
                            reaffirm his commitment to preserve the constitutional system and to
                            respect the rights of the opposition, and take some measures to restrain
                            the extreme left. At the other end of the spectrum this course might
                            involve such measures as a systematic crackdown on the <gloss
                                target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> and other perpetrators of violence and
                            the establishment of a regular means by which the <gloss

                            advance on potentially contentious policy decisions. There would be in
                            any case a deliberate effort to reduce the political temperature by
                            curbing illegal and violent activities and by seeking agreement with the
                            opposition on such sensitive issues as the pace and character of
                            expropriation of private enterprises and farms.</p>
                        <p>61. From present evidence, relatively modest steps seem more likely—at
                            least in the short run—than does a substantial change in the character
                            of the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> government. The pressures on
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to pursue more
                            substantial forms of accommodation would probably rise if the opposition
                            made notable gains in the March 1973 election.</p>
                        <p>62. Whatever the form or timing of a move towards compromise by <persName

                            preserve the revolutionary advances achieved so far by his regime—not to
                            repudiate them. Since <pb n="613" facs="0653" xml:id="pg_613"/>most
                            leaders of the political center and of the military are in general
                            agreement with the need for far-reaching social and economic reforms,
                            and support many of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            specific measures (e.g., copper nationalization), they too would be

                                >Allende</persName>, perhaps with only marginal alterations in the

                                >Allende</persName> and the opposition would find it advantageous to

                            opposition would be to keep the political system healthy enough so they
                            can compete for an eventual return to power. <persName

                        <p>63. Regardless of how the arrangement came about, or of the precise form
                            of accommodation, groups on both the extreme left and the far right
                            would feel threatened by it. Extreme leftists in and out of the
                            government would be persuaded that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> had betrayed the revolution. Especially if major
                            steps toward cooperation with the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>
                            were taken, there would probably be a schism within the <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>; at least some Socialist extremists and
                            members of the like-minded mini-groups would bolt and perhaps establish
                            an alliance with the MIR. On the conservative side of the political
                            spectrum, some of the Nationals would probably conclude that their
                            interests were in danger and work hard to subvert the cooperation
                            between the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> and the center forces.
                            Although the atmosphere of confrontation in the country as a whole would
                            tend to dissipate, at least some extremists would turn to the use of
                            systematic violence, including both guerrilla warfare in the countryside
                            and urban terrorism.</p>
                        <p>64. Moves by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> towards
                            slowing the pace of the revolution would probably reduce discontent
                            within the military and the <hi rend="italic">Carabineros.</hi> Though
                            some right-wing officers might continue to plot, they would have little
                            support for a coup from their colleagues. The security forces would
                            probably cope reasonably well with the challenge from extremists. The
                            insurgents would not be likely to gain broad popular support (as they
                            might if <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> were forced
                            from office). Indeed, even the <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss>
                            would be likely to split between diehards and compromisers, and the
                            groups that it has organized—e.g., the Mapuche Indians—would be likely
                            to fight only if their immediate interests were threatened. A certain
                            proportion of the extremist wing of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s Socialist Party and some members of the
                            mini-parties of the far left (e.g., the <gloss target="#t_MAPU_1"
                                >MAPU</gloss>) might join in the insurgency or promote disorders
                            through strikes and mass demonstrations. Again, we judge that the
                            security forces would be able to maintain control, and there would be
                            little likelihood that the violence would reach the level of civil war
                            (i.e., with thousands of armed combatants and hundreds of
                            casualties).</p>

                        <p>65. Because of the mercurial character of Chilean politics in general and
                            the extent of polarization so far under <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> in particular, it is difficult to judge the
                            likely longevity of moves by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> towards cooperation with the political center.
                            To some extent, once the pressures that produced this political
                            departure receded—fear of civil war or military coup—the resurgence of
                            politics as usual would work to weaken interest in conciliation and
                            compromise. The politicians would have to weigh their interest in seeing
                            that the political system survives and orderly elections are held with
                            their interest in seeking extreme partisan advantage on contentious
                            issues between elections.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>66. The implications for Chile over the longer term of slowing the pace
                            of the revolution would depend on many unknowns and unknowables. It is
                            possible that the revolutionary dynamic might still undermine the
                            country’s democratic tradition. But the chances for an open and
                            meaningful Presidential election in 1976 would probably be considerably
                            improved. Even if <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            continued to move forward with the economic and social goals of his
                            revolution, the democratic political system could still be sustained by
                            such institutions as an independent military, a free press, a vigorous
                            congress, and a politically sophisticated populace.</p>
                        <p>67. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government would
                            still have to contend with prickly domestic and international problems,
                            particularly in the economic field. Painful political decisions on the
                            basic economic imbalances inherited by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> or engendered by his policies would still have
                            to be faced: a curb on wages and consumption; a major boosting of farm
                            and copper output; the rescheduling of payments on the foreign debt; and
                            the attraction of large-scale foreign private investment or governmental
                            aid.</p>
                        <p>68. We doubt that there would be a dramatic change in Chile’s relations
                            with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> or China. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would still seek their
                            economic aid, and this would probably continue to increase gradually.
                            Relations with Cuba might come under strain, especially if the

                            struggle. But we judge that <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Fidel
                                Castro</persName> would not give major support to the <gloss

                            and as a sign to other interested Latin American countries (e.g., Peru)
                            that they can do business with Cuba.</p>
                        <p>69. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s pursuit of the path

                            little reason to believe that they would press for generous
                            compensation. These elements, however, would encourage <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to avert a showdown on the
                            issue, perhaps by leaving open the possibility of compensation through
                            international arbitration, and they would reinforce <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s tendency to avoid a complete
                            rupture of relations with the US. The Chileans would probably expect the

                        <p>On 5 November 1971 the 40 Committee approved [<hi rend="italic">dollar

                            Committee approved the expenditure through October 1972 for the <gloss

                        <p>Three particularly significant elections took place during the period
                            from May through July 1972. The nationwide election held in the powerful
                            Chilean labor confederation (Central Unica de Trabajadores (<gloss
                                target="#t_CUT_1">CUT</gloss>) from 30 May to 6 June was important
                            because the results indicated growing dissatisfaction with the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government in the labor sector
                            which the government specifically claims to represent. The other two
                            elections, those held on 6 July in the Student Federation at the
                            University of Chile (FECH) and on 16 July to fill a deputy’s seat in
                            Coquimbo Province, were won by the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>
                            even though electoral results indicated a further slow but steady
                            erosion of popular support for the government. These two elections also
                            pointed up the vital and some<pb n="618" facs="0658" xml:id="pg_618"

                                >PDC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss>, the two
                            strongest opposition parties, which at that time were exacerbated by the
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>’s negotiations in June with the
                                <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> government on the “Three Areas”
                            bill. The most encouraging development was the decision of the four
                            opposition parties to form a united opposition confederation for the
                            March 1973 congressional election. It should be noted, however, that the
                            confederation was opposed by a number of important leaders of the <gloss

                                >Renan Fuentealba</persName>, and that considerable difficulties can
                            be anticipated in maintaining confederation unity through the March 1973
                            elections.</p>

                            This means that since 5 November 1971 a total of [<hi rend="italic"
                                >dollar amount not declassified</hi>] has been passed to the four

                        <p>During the past three months the government has continued to increase its
                            control over the Chilean economy, expropriating lands and taking over
                            major industries. Despite the steady erosion of the private sector,
                            which represents a major source of support for the opposition political
                            parties, the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> still must reckon with a
                            hostile Congress and a steady decline in popular support which deters
                            the government from calling a plebiscite to push through its
                            revolutionary plans. <persName corresp="#p_VBP_1">Pedro

                            described the present economic situation in Chile by saying, “The
                            problem of power is still unresolved and this is the key problem in any

                        <p>A larger number of ballots (over 650,000) were cast in this election than
                            in any electoral contest since the April 1971 municipal elections. The

                                >UP</gloss> efforts to give the <gloss target="#t_CUT_1">CUT</gloss>
                            legal status as the government’s labor arm were partially blocked by
                            Congress; a bill finally passed in January 1972 did give the <gloss

                            <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>’s peasant confederations insisted
                            that they did not wish to belong to the <gloss target="#t_CUT_1"
                                >CUT</gloss> and refused to pay the back dues which would have

                            election. The <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>’s union sector
                            finally voted to participate, but the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> campaign on behalf of its <gloss target="#t_CUT_1"
                                >CUT</gloss> presidential candidate, Ernesto Vogel, started slowly.
                            In the last days of the campaign, however, the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> made a massive and effective effort which was fully

                                >PDC</gloss>’s most optimistic expectations.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> claimed victory from the outset,
                            basing its claims on the tabulations made at local voting spots (either
                            work sites or union headquarters) which were supervised by local union
                            officers. The official tally (delayed for over a month) remained in the
                            hands of the Communist-controlled <gloss target="#t_CUT_1">CUT</gloss>
                            electoral commission, which was charged with fraud by the Socialist and
                            Radical Parties as well as the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>. The
                            “official” results announced on 13 July gave first place in the nine
                            slate contest to the Communists, second to the Socialists and third to
                            the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>, with less than 1,000 votes
                            separating the <gloss target="#t_PS_1">PS</gloss> and the <gloss

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>, which still claims its slate
                            won first place, is considering presenting a bill to Congress calling

                            under the supervision of the national electoral board. Even if this
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> effort is unsuccessful, the
                                <gloss target="#t_CUT_1">CUT</gloss> election demonstrated that the
                            opposition has significant support within a highly important labor
                            sector which has long been dominated by the leftist parties.</p>

                        <p>In May 1972, opposition parties united under the leadership of Rector

                            of the University of Chile. Following the successful <persName

                            vigorous efforts by Rector <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Boeninger</persName> as well as Station assets in the various

                            common slate. <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> intransigence was
                            responsible for the opposition’s failure to achieve unity early in the

                            propaganda and advertising campaigns which were offensive to the <gloss

                            and must bear some responsibility for the opposition failure.</p>
                        <p>The existence of three opposition slates (<gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss> and Gremialist)
                            predictably insured the victory of the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss> candidate, even though the results demonstrated that the

                            would have had the decisive vote on the Student Executive Council. The

                            bring about an accord between <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> and

                            large a legacy of mutual recrimination and bitterness that these student

                            advantage. The gap between the government and the opposition narrowed

                            withdrawal from the government in April 1972 and created an impasse
                            between the legislative and executive branches of the government. While

                            was allegedly to resolve this impasse, the clandestine and
                            unconventional manner in which the conversations were held created
                            widespread suspicion among the other opposition parties as well as among
                            the rank and file of <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> supporters.
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> leaders generally admit that
                                <persName corresp="#p_FMR_1">Fuentealba</persName> was wrong in
                            responding to the government without consulting other opposition party

                        <p>When no agreement had been reached after 15 days of negotiation, the

                        <p>On 7 July, only minutes before the deadline imposed by the Electoral

                            elections. Earlier that day the government coalition had registered its
                            own federation.</p>
                        <p>Part of the opposition’s difficulty was created by negotiation over the
                            selection of candidates for a single slate, since the four parties
                            together can present no more candidates than there are seats to be
                            filled. The opposition parties finally reached tentative agreement on
                            all candidates except those who will run for the Senate from Santiago
                            Province. (This represents a considerable accomplishment, since the

                            does not control the party, many of whose leaders remain extremely
                            sensitive to government charges of an “alliance with the right.”
                            Although the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> rank and file are more
                            strongly anti-government than the party leadership, the party as a whole
                            remains fully committed to the constitutional process, supports many of

                            elections. He may at that time make some proposal to dissolve the

                            an estimated 8,000 members, replacing the old, unwieldy “comuna”, which
                            in some urban areas in Santiago had 40,000 members. This reorganization,

                            antagonized the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> and have had some
                            negative impact on the prospects for opposition unity for the

                            stance in a more polarized political climate and will have difficulty in

                            formidable political opponents of the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                            >UP</gloss>, winning the support of an increasing percentage of the
                            Chilean electorate, the government has fulfilled a major part of its
                            revolutionary program by increasing its control over the Chilean
                            economy. Systematic expropriation of land and government takeovers of
                            almost all banks and major industries have laid the groundwork for a
                            totally state-controlled economy. Since the private sector forms an
                            integral part of the opposition forces in Chile and is its natural
                            source of political funds, the takeover of the economy by the <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> government would seriously weaken the
                            entire opposition.</p>
                        <p>The Chilean private sector has only recently begun to appreciate the full
                            magnitude of the dangers posed by the government’s economic program. The
                            complex array of organizations representing private enterprise among
                            large and small businessmen, industrialists, farmers, workers and
                            peasants have begun to consolidate and to organize in opposition to the
                            government. Economic survival is of course their primary concern, and
                            this can be achieved only by preventing or limiting further
                            nationalization. This fact has tended to politicize the private sector
                            and to increase its willingness to work closely with the opposition
                            parties and to assist them wherever possible. In turn, the support of
                            the opposition parties and the democratic media is essential to enable
                            the private sector to mobilize the support it needs from Congress <pb
                                n="625" facs="0665" xml:id="pg_625"/>and the Chilean public.
                            Therefore, support and encouragement of the politically-oriented
                            activities of the private sector would represent an operational adjunct
                            to the main effort of direct support to the opposition political
                            parties.</p>

                            <hi rend="roman">II.</hi> Background</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government has drawn
                            up a list of all Chilean corporations whose capital reserves exceed
                            $500,000; by the government’s own estimate, these 189 corporations
                            account for 82% of the capital holdings of the 1,987 companies
                            incorporated in Chile. Many of these companies are already
                            government-owned, and those still in private hands are earmarked for
                            early nationalization.</p>
                        <p>As of January 1972, the State had ownership or control of approximately
                            200 enterprises, of which about half had been taken over by the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government. In
                            January 1972 the government published a list of the 91 remaining large
                            firms which were scheduled for imminent nationalization.</p>
                        <p>In a belated move to moderate <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s effort to obtain increased control over the
                            economy, the Chilean Congress on 19 February approved a bill sponsored
                            by the Christian Democratic Party (<gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>)
                            defining the economic areas subject to government ownership, and making
                            all government takeovers since October 1971 in other areas subject to
                            congressional approval. After weeks of negotiation with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> in early April 1972 vetoed the key portions of
                            the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> constitutional amendment and
                            added clauses which would significantly ease the government’s efforts to
                            increase its control of the economy.</p>
                        <p>The impasse over the “three areas” bill has yet to be resolved, but the
                            government has continued to expropriate, requisition or intervene
                            Chilean firms. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>] The
                            manufacturing sector can serve as one example of the gravity of this
                            situation. The government already controls 32.8% of Chilean
                            manufacturing exclusive of the manufacturers included on the “List of
                            91,” which represent an additional 20%. A government takeover of the
                            manufacturing firms on the “List of 91” will thus give the government
                            control of more than 52% of all Chilean manufacturing.</p>
                        <p>In the agricultural field, the government has stopped giving out figures
                            on land expropriations and takeovers. Under the Agrarian Reform Law, all
                            farms exceeding 80 hectares of irrigated land are subject to legal
                            expropriation, a process which was to be completed by the end of July
                            1972. In addition, police reports recently published in <hi
                                rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> reflect a total of some 1,768 illegal
                            farm takeovers from November 1970 to early March 1972. It is estimated
                            that 55% of all farm land (in<pb n="626" facs="0666" xml:id="pg_626"
                            />cluding 45% of all irrigated land) is now in the reformed sector and
                            thus under government control.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> government’s effort to assume
                            greater control of the private sector is a key part of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s drive to make socialism
                            “irreversible” in Chile. The survival of the private sector is crucial
                            to the opposition because this sector represents a sizable segment of
                            Chilean society not yet under government control as well as an important
                            source of funds for opposition political parties. Thus, any significant
                            increase in the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>’s control of the
                            economy will inevitably strengthen <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s position against the opposition political

                            believed it possible that Chile might entertain government-to-government
                            discussions, or failing that the Chileans themselves might offer to
                            enter into some form of international adjudication, probably via the
                            1914 arbitration treaty. Note was also made of the importance of
                            establishing for the record, to be used at the next Paris Club round,
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>’s good faith performance on the

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFR_1">Milliken</persName> said the company has
                            no desire to enter into direct discussions with the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>, believing rather that its interests
                            are better served by various legal actions it has undertaken and is
                            contemplating. He doubted that the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                            itself would be interested in talking to the company, but subsequently
                            acknowledged that the company would not be averse to such discussions if
                            the Chileans have some specific proposal to offer.</p>
                        <p>On government-to-government negotiations, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MFR_1">Milliken</persName> made clear that while he had
                            no objection to <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> efforts to this
                            end, the company would not stay any of its current or contemplated legal
                            actions to obtain such discussions nor could it indicate beforehand to
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> what measures it might consider
                            as constituting progress toward a possible settlement. He would not wish
                            such discussions to prejudice the company’s efforts. Any substantive
                            issues which might be involved in such discussions would have to be
                            submitted, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFR_1">Milliken</persName>
                            asserted, to his Board of Directors for approval. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MFR_1">Milliken</persName> acknowledged that the company
                            had requested the Secretary of State by letter in the early stages of
                            the copper expropriation to take the company’s problems up with the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> at the diplomatic level.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FMB_1">Feldman</persName> noted the tactical
                            problem that we would face at Paris if the Chileans should agree to
                            negotiate. Our leverage with the other creditors depends on the US being
                            able to document that Chile is not meeting its commitments. It would
                            weaken our position if Chile could claim the US has not complied with
                            the Paris agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFR_1">Milliken</persName> emphasized that the
                            company’s views of its problems in Chile had a wider focus and went
                            beyond the bounds of what might be recovered in payment for its debt and
                            equity interests. He said there were other and more important factors
                            involved of a business nature and the company would bear these in mind
                            as contrasted with a narrower objective of securing some minimal payment
                            from the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> for its expropriated
                            properties. He also made clear that the company’s determination to
                            pursue legal and other remedies contemplated the possibility that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> might stop payment on the
                            Braden debt. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFR_1">Milliken</persName> noted
                            that the Chileans only decided to make the payments on the debt after
                            the company took legal action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McCreary made clear that Kennecott no longer has any legal action
                            pending in Chile. He stated the company formally withdrew from the
                            Copper Tribunal’s proceedings. He acknowledged that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> might continue to press its own claims
                            against the company before the Tribunal, possibly in an effort to
                            increase the amount of negative compensation or conceivably to build a
                            record of its own adherence to “judicial” proceedings.</p>
                        <p>Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_MFR_1">Milliken</persName> and McCreary
                            stated they had not thought too much about the possibilities of
                            international arbitration or adjudication <pb n="629" facs="0669"
                                xml:id="pg_629"/>and could not offer a company position on the
                            subject. Mr. Millikin expressed doubt the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> would in any case be willing to submit to any form of
                            arbitration. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FMB_1">Feldman</persName>
                            reviewed the provisions of the 1914 Treaty which in its initial stage
                            constitutes a conciliation procedure, and suggested that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> might possibly choose to pursue this
                            course as part of its own image-building on the international scene and
                            specifically before the Paris Club creditors. However, to do so Chile
                            would have to risk review of its actions by a body not subject to its
                            control.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName> summed up the
                            discussions and pointed out that the coordinated efforts of the
                            Departments of State, Treasury and other interested agencies were
                            designed to explore all possible avenues of obtaining relief for the US
                            companies involved and that while the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> acknowledges the right of all nations to expropriate,
                            we continue to insist that they pay adequate compensation. He also
                            observed that the possibility of some form of arbitration in this
                            dispute, which went well beyond the interests of any one company, could
                            have major impact on Latin America’s traditional adherence to the Calvo
                            doctrine whereby they have refused to acknowledge the right of other
                            States to represent the economic interests of their nationals abroad.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName> emphasized the
                            importance of keeping in close contact with the companies in order to
                            insure that in our efforts on their behalf we in no way prejudice other
                            courses of action which the companies themselves are pursuing. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFR_1">Milliken</persName> acknowledged the
                            usefulness of maintaining such contacts and promised to keep in
                            touch.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Following the September 11 ruling of the Chilean Special Copper Tribunal
                            that it had no jurisdiction over the excess profits findings against the
                            U.S. companies, Kennecott announced that it was withdrawing from further
                            legal proceedings in Chile and would “pursue in other nations its
                            remedies for the confiscated assets”. The Chilean Government reacted
                            angrily and threatened to reconsider its previous recognition of its
                                (<gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss>-insured) debt to
                            Kennecott.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently, a Paris court issued an attachment relating to a shipment
                            of Chilean copper at Kennecott’s request. The shipment, valued at over
                            $1 million, is destined for a consortium which handles French copper
                            imports. The court order (dated September 30) specifies that the
                            consortium may take delivery of the copper but that payment may not be
                            made to the Chilean exporter (<gloss target="#t_CODELCO_1"
                                >CODELCO</gloss>, the Chilean Government copper agency) until the
                            proceeding initiated by Kennecott has been completed.</p>
                        <p>If Kennecott is able to press its case in other countries as well,
                            Chilean foreign exchange earnings, 75–80% of which come from copper
                            exports, could be appreciably damaged. The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss>’s sharp reaction reveals its fears in this respect.</p>
                        <p>Virtually all Chilean sectors have joined in condemning the Kennecott
                            action. Additionally, the bitter language used by <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> supporters tends to link the U.S.
                            Government with Kennecott’s move. We are pointing out at suitable
                            opportunities that the action is a private suit by a private company.
                            Kennecott in fact did not advise us of this action, nor is it likely to
                            do so in the future. The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            government will probably obtain considerable acceptance for its thesis
                            that the suit is “further proof” of an “international embargo” being
                            orchestrated against Chile by the U.S. in collusion with multinational
                            corporations.</p>
                        <pb n="631" facs="0671" xml:id="pg_631"/>
                        <p>In sum, for the short term at least, the Kennecott action appears to have
                            touched <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> on a tender spot
                            but at the same time provided him some part of what we have carefully
                            sought to deny him: a useful pretext for shifting blame for Chile’s
                            economic problems, and a basis for rallying sympathy and support.</p>

                        <p>In the attached memorandum <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> proposes
                            assistance to the Chilean political parties and private sector groups
                            opposed to the Popular Unity (<gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>)

                            September memorandum from the 40 Committee Secretariat; we understand
                            that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s concurrence
                            is meant.)</p>
                        <p>The Agency memorandum notes that although the opposition parties have the
                            requisite organization and will to organize a strong campaign, their
                            economic strength has been so undermined by government policy that
                            financial assistance of the scope requested is essential if they are to
                            campaign effectively. The Agency, stating that a substantial popular
                            vote for the opposition would demonstrate degradation of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> government’s mandate, estimates that
                            anything in excess of a 55/45 percent split in favor of the opposition
                            would represent an opposition victory. It is difficult to predict with
                            accuracy the results in the Chamber or in the Senate of any particular
                            distribution of the popular vote; a 60/40 split in favor of the
                            opposition perhaps could maintain the present opposition majority, which
                            stands at 93 to 55 in the Chamber (there are two vacancies) and 32 to 18
                            in the Senate. A vote that would give the opposition a two-thirds
                            majority in both houses is extremely unlikely. All Chamber seats and
                            one-half of the Senate seats are to be contested. The opposition, as is
                            the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>, is campaigning as a
                            confederation; that is, the component parties are arranging to field an
                            agreed list of candidates so that their aggregate strength will be
                            reflected in the election results to the maximum measure.</p>
                        <p>The risks appear to be acceptable as far as disbursement to the parties
                            is concerned. [<hi rend="italic">5½ lines not declassified</hi>]</p>

                            what appears to be a preponderant measure of support among the Chilean
                            electorate. The March elections are manifestly critical and we concur in
                            the Agency estimate that our support is essential to the fortunes of the

                                political tensions so dramatically that rumors of an imminent
                                military coup were widely credited. President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> publicly denounced the
                                existence of a “September Plan” to overthrow his government, blaming
                                foreign imperialism and the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>,
                                and skillfully exploiting the Kennecott copper issue to mobilize
                                popular support for his government. The military, however, have
                                apparently accepted the forced retirement of General <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CMA_1">Alfredo Canales</persName>, who was generally
                                acknowledged to be the leader of the military coup plotters. If no
                                new crisis occurs before mid-October the attention of the nation
                                will thereafter be focused increasingly on the elections, which will
                                provide a concrete reading of public sentiment for or against the
                                government at its mid-term point. The extent of popular support
                                received by the government will determine whether the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> continues to try to implement its
                                revolutionary program legally. A substantial popular vote in favor
                                of the opposition would demonstrate that the government has lost the
                                popular mandate it received in the 1971 municipal election, when the
                                    <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> received 49.74% of the total
                                vote. If the government can in fact be proved to represent a
                                definite minority of the Chilean people, this would tend to
                                strengthen opposition determination to force a change in government
                                policies.</p>

                                in both houses of Congress. Since <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"

                                in Chile, with the opposition parties making effective use of their
                                legislative control to harass the government and to block the

                                    >UP</gloss> parties received almost 50% of the total popular
                                vote. The opposition <pb n="635" facs="0675" xml:id="pg_635"/>will
                                use the municipal election results as a base from which to draw
                                conclusions about the March 1973 results, since it is generally
                                assumed that <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> popular support has
                                deteriorated since 1971. In short, the opposition will claim that
                                anything in excess of a 55/45% split of the popular vote in their
                                favor represents an opposition victory. The political and
                                psychological impact of the election will increase in direct
                                proportion to the magnitude of an opposition victory. A strong
                                electoral effort will be needed if the opposition is to attain the
                                roughly 60% of the vote which it will need to maintain its present
                                substantial Congressional majority. A few seats may be lost, but if
                                the opposition succeeds in approximating its present Congressional
                                strength, it will have proved that the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                    >UP</gloss> represents a distinct minority of the
                                population.</p>
                            <p>The optimum opposition goal, which unfortunately appears to be out of
                                reach, would be for the opposition to obtain a two-thirds majority
                                in both houses of Congress (100 deputies and 34 senators). Such a
                                majority would enable the opposition parties to override
                                presidential vetoes of legislative bills and would theoretically
                                provide the necessary votes for a presidential impeachment. The
                                opposition parties would, however, have to obtain at least 65% of
                                the popular vote to acquire this two-thirds majority. They are
                                unlikely to achieve this goal, however, unless economic conditions
                                deteriorate even more dramatically. Since the <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government will spare no
                                effort to insure that its working class electorate receives good
                                wages and adequate food supplies during the pre-election period,
                                even if government resources are exhausted in the process, it will
                                probably be able to maintain some semblance of economic stability
                                during the normally prosperous summer months ahead.</p>

                            <p>A recent ruling by the Chilean Electoral Tribunal enables political
                                parties to form electoral confederations for the March 1973
                                elections. Both the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> and the
                                opposition have registered for confederation status, and thus are
                                eligible to present unified lists of candidates. The number of
                                candidates on each confederation list cannot exceed the number of
                                seats to be filled in each electoral district. Extensive meetings
                                have been held to select candidates for the confederation slates,
                                but neither the opposition nor the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                    >UP</gloss> has completed this process. This is understandable
                                for the selection process is delicate both because of the competing
                                interests of the various parties and the personal ambitions of
                                incumbent and aspiring candidates. Although it is believed that the
                                opposition parties will be able to resolve their immediate problems
                                and to agree on a unified slate, individual party campaigns for
                                candidates will be conducted separately. The mechanics of the
                                Chilean electoral system tend to magnify inter-party differences,
                                even within the same confederation where parties still compete with
                                each other as well as with the rival confederation. This situation
                                will plague the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> confederation
                                campaign as well as the opposition. <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                    >UP</gloss> control of the government will probably enable the

                                more effectively than the opposition. Similarly, the financial and
                                material resources available to the government will probably enable
                                the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> to overwhelm the opposition
                                if the latter does not obtain external support as proposed in this

                            <p>Chile uses the D’Hondt proportional representation electoral system.
                                Each voter is permitted to vote for only one Deputy and one Senator.
                                According to the electoral regulations permitting political
                                confederations, the number of deputy and senate seats won by each
                                confederation will be based on the total number of votes each
                                confederation receives. Within each confederation, seats will then
                                be awarded to those candidates who receive the largest number of
                                votes in each district. Thus, while every vote for every candidate
                                counts for a confederation’s overall slate, each party will
                                obviously be maneuvering to insure maximum electoral benefits for
                                each of its own candidates. This electoral system creates rivalries
                                even within individual parties which have more than one candidate on
                                the confederation slate in a particular district, because they will
                                also be competing with each other. For this reason, Chilean
                                politicians tend to campaign individually, and as a result the
                                parties generally lack the organization and discipline which are
                                essential to an optimum campaign effort. The combination of the
                                confederation and D’Hondt system used in Chile also means that the
                                larger political parties will tend to gain at the expense of the
                                smaller ones.</p>

                                strongest anti-government line, emphasizing its anti-Communism and
                                doctrinaire differences with the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>
                                program, while the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> will
                                concentrate its attack on the government’s method of governing,
                                inefficiency, and failure to carry out its promises. Both opposition
                                Radical parties will focus on issues designed to induce further
                                defections from the original Radical Party’s clientele. In spite of
                                the divisive factors which will hinder opposition efforts to
                                organize a unified campaign, the opposition parties are making an
                                attempt to coordinate their activities. The opposition confederation
                                has established a joint electoral commission which has almost
                                completed the selection of candidates and which will meet regularly
                                to coordinate propaganda and to try to insure that none of the
                                parties sponsors legislation or makes public statements which are
                                objectionable to other members of the confederation.</p>

                            <p>It is proposed that [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                    declassified</hi>] be approved for passage to four opposition
                                political parties and [<hi rend="italic">number not

                                1973 Congressional election campaign. In addition to the campaign
                                budgets, funds are also requested to permit financial subsidies to
                                the political parties in the immediate post-electoral period [<hi

                                course of action is being determined. The dollar costs shown in the
                                budgets, which are attached as annexes, are calculated on the basis
                                of the current black market rate of approximately 300 escudos to the

                            <p>The funds requested are considered sufficient to provide each of the

                                effective campaign. These funds will be supplemented by money
                                obtained by these parties and the individual candidates through
                                their own fund-raising drives. A large portion of the funds expended
                                in political campaigns in Chile has traditionally been raised by the

                            <p>The four political parties differ in their approaches to providing

                                campesino groups, and is allocating relatively few funds to specific
                                candidates. The <gloss target="#t_PN_1">PN</gloss> has taken the
                                approach that candidates will receive materials and services from
                                the party rather than being provided with direct financial aid. The

                        <p>The current middle class strike wave is the most serious challenge to
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to date, but is not
                            likely to topple his government. Motivated primarily by basic political
                            and economic grievances, the breadth of support for the protest has
                            surprised even opposition political leaders. No one political group is
                            in effective control of events, and no common goals have emerged. The
                            military is exerting behind-the-scenes pressure for accommodation and
                            hopes to avoid more direct intervention in the situation. While
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is expected to
                            weather the crisis, economic and political tensions and grievances will
                            almost certainly result in additional challenges as the scheduled March
                            1973 congressional elections approach.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Protest politically motivated.</hi> The underlying
                            cause of the current confrontation in Chile is an accumulation of
                            general grievances and fears triggered by the specific bread-and-butter
                            complaints of individual transport owners. Continuing threats to
                            political freedoms and to what remains of the private sector have
                            stimulated support from other groups. The manner in which the situation
                            has evolved suggests that there was some pre-planning and an
                            orchestration of support by elements not immediately concerned with the
                            transport industry, primarily business and professional groups. There
                            has not been agreement on goals, however.</p>

                            parties have been carried along by force of circumstances and appear to
                            have been surprised by the intensity and breadth of support for the
                            strikers. They have taken advantage of the situation to air a broad
                            range of complaints, and have spurned overtures by <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to discuss the situation.
                            Opposition political leaders are not in effective control of events,
                            however. Awareness that chance developments could further weaken their
                            control argues strongly in favor of early accommodation. Should the
                            situation deteriorate further, demands that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> make significant political and economic
                            concessions can be expected to escalate. <pb n="641" facs="0681"
                                xml:id="pg_641"/>The danger exists that when and if <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> offered such concessions,
                            political leaders on both sides of the spectrum would not be able to
                            convince the more militant of their followers of the need for
                            compromise. So far there has been relatively little violence, but acts
                            of sabotage or worsening street confrontations would harden attitudes on
                            both sides.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Armed Forces: reluctant arbiters</hi>. The Armed
                            Forces have been drawn reluctantly into the situation by having had
                            thrust upon them the unwelcome task of maintaining public order by
                            enforcing government edicts. Military leaders remain hopeful that
                            Chile’s political leadership will resolve the current situation, and are
                            working behind the scenes to encourage this development. They are
                            attempting to play the role of neutral arbiter—for example, by
                            monitoring radio broadcasts to assure balanced news reporting. It is
                            highly unlikely that the military would initiate a move to assume direct
                            control of events or of the government until it were convinced that
                            other remedies had been exhausted. The military is neither confident of
                            its own capacity to govern nor does it have a program whereby to do so.
                            Should the positions of both the opposition and the government harden,
                            the military would apply ever-increasing pressure to both sides in an
                            effort to force an accommodation. The military would physically
                            intervene only after continuing, increasing, and uncontrolled disorders,
                            or a clearly perceived threat to Chile’s constitution and institutions
                            had provided what it considered sufficient justification to act.</p>

                                >Allende</persName>’s chances of weathering the present crisis are
                            better than even. To do so, however, he will have to devise some formula
                            whereby to satisfy the opposition that he has made meaningful
                            concessions while appearing to his supporters to have arrived at the
                            best solution possible under the circumstances. The disarray of his
                            Popular Unity coalition probably affords <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> somewhat more room to maneuver with the
                            opposition than would be the case in a more tranquil situation.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">More troubles ahead</hi>. The present confrontation is
                            the latest in a series of crises, each of which has had the effect of
                            lowering the level of political tolerance and increasing the tensions of
                            subsequent developments. Assuming the resolution of the present
                            situation, the momentum generated by such tensions and by continuing
                            economic deterioration will almost certainly cause additional
                            confrontations in the not-too-distant future. These will further
                            constrain the ability of each of the principal actors—<persName

                        <p>The current widespread strike in Chile is the latest and by far the most
                            serious in a series of escalating crises faced by the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> Government since it took
                            office in November 1970. Given the constitutionalist persuasions of the
                            Chilean military, the chances are better than even that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> will survive his present
                            difficulties. However, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            will probably make some concessions to placate the demands of the
                            private sector and political opposition just to restore order. At a
                            minimum, the latest popular reaction against the deteriorating economic
                            situation and in opposition to the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>
                            program against the private sector only enhances the prospects for
                            further and increasingly serious confrontations between the government
                            and its opponents.</p>
                        <p>This paper is limited to a review of only those more likely contingency
                            situations involving a change in government or a major change in the
                            present government’s policies and which could require an overall review
                            of U.S. policy toward Chile. The Ad Hoc Working Group recognizes that
                            such a chain of events may be set into motion by deteriorating
                            conditions or the actions of other power groups rather than by the
                            military itself. However, no such change could be effected without
                            active military support.</p>
                        <p>Possible military intervention could: (A) force <persName

                            “violations” and hold new elections; (C) carry out an outright coup
                            without any reference to elections; or (D) attempt to oust the <persName

                            divisions within its own ranks. These contingencies are separately
                            reviewed below.</p>

                        <p>Acting in unison, the Chilean military, including the Carabineros
                            (National Police), could seek a compromise solution to the escalating
                            confrontations between government and opposition forces by forcing
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to moderate his
                            policies specifically with respect to the economic survival of
                            opposition media outlets and further government encroachments on the
                            private sector. The explicit or implied threat of more drastic military
                            action might induce <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to
                            accede (possible leftist reaction is discussed below). An adjustment of
                            economic policies to reduce consumer frustrations might also be
                            contemplated.</p>
                        <p>This option for the Chilean military would have the attraction of staying
                            within constitutional bounds. It could incorporate several variations
                            including a possible demand by the military that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> invite opposition parties to
                            participate in a government of national “reconciliation”. Conceivably,
                            the military might even participate in the cabinet. The former seems
                            unlikely as the opposition would hesitate to share the government’s
                            burden of resolving the country’s critical economic problems. In the
                            latter case, while the military earlier decided not to participate in
                            the cabinet for the same reason, they could have a change of mind in the
                            future.</p>
                        <p>This contingency would leave <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> in office and would not significantly change the
                            nature of our bilateral problems. It could, however, enhance the
                            opposition political parties’ prospects for electoral gains in the March
                            1973 parliamentary elections on the grounds that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> had become a “lame duck”
                            president.</p>

                                >Allende</persName>, a united military could force his withdrawal
                            from the presidency and invoke the legal provisions for holding new
                            elections. Although <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> can
                            be expected to exercise great care in this regard, the military could
                            cite some constitutional “violation” to purport to justify its actions,
                            or could find subtler means to carry out its intent. While <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is unlikely to volunteer his

                            unconstitutional action, it is conceivable that he might prefer a
                            gracious exit on the pretext of ailing health to an unceremonious
                            ouster.</p>
                        <p>While contingencies B and C both involve military interventions, the key
                            element in contingency B is the military’s declared intention promptly
                            to restore constitutional government. It would serve to demonstrate that
                            the military did not act in its own self-interest to usurp power.
                            Possible elements of this contingency might be the designation <pb

                        </p>
                        <p>There is no indication of any widespread sense of “mission” among the
                            Chilean military to take over and run the country. However, in a chaotic
                            situation, it is conceivable that the influence of some military men
                            might cause an intervention in the form of an outright coup for an
                            indefinite period with little pretense of holding elections or returning
                            to constitutional norms within a predictable time frame.</p>
                        <p>Depending on the circumstances, some private sector and political groups
                            probably would welcome military rule, for a time at least, while the
                            most difficult problems of economic adjustment and possible extreme
                            leftist terrorism are being faced rather than assume that responsibility
                            directly. However, as the period of military rule were extended, the
                            normal reaction of the political parties, and particularly the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss>, to return the country to
                            constitutional government would be manifested.</p>
                        <p>The almost total lack of preparedness of the Chilean military to run a
                            government, particularly one enmeshed in critical economic difficulties,
                            would also argue against the likelihood of this contingency.
                            Furthermore, the Chilean military are all too well aware of the
                            political pitfalls which they would face.</p>
                        <p>D. <hi rend="italic">Divided Military</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The divisions within and between Chilean military services, the absence
                            to date of a charismatic military figure who could unite all the Armed
                            Forces and the possible effective infiltration of the military by the
                                <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> could lead to a situation where
                            some elements of the military seek to carry out one of the above
                            contingencies and encounter significant resistance from within the Armed
                            Forces. This contingency would tend to escalate rather than lessen the
                            level of public disorder and violence. This would be particularly true
                            if the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> parties engaged in the same
                            type of demonstrations and strike action now being employed by the
                            government’s opponents. The resulting indeterminate situation with rival
                            military factions supported by civilian elements could degenerate into a
                            civil war.</p>
                        <p>We consider this contingency as unlikely. Despite the lack of apparent
                            cohesiveness between the different services, most observers doubt that
                            Chilean military units would fire on each other regardless of their
                            possible differing views on how to resolve the nation’s political or <pb
                                n="645" facs="0685" xml:id="pg_645"/>economic crises. It is more
                            likely that those units which are disinclined to act would stand aside
                            without taking any action against their more determined colleagues.
                            Should the situation degenerate into widespread shooting, the military
                            would tend to close ranks, particularly against any threat from armed
                            civilian elements regardless of their political leanings.</p>

                            of one of the above contingencies could take the form of a non-violent
                            show of strength through strike action, the occupation of factories, and
                            street demonstrations. These tactics, which would be favored by the
                            Communists, Radicals and some Socialists, could be used to overawe the
                            military and the country in general with leftist support among the
                            working class. Such passive resistance or peaceful show of strength
                            probably would not deter or reverse the actions of a determined and
                            unified military bent on carrying out the above contingencies. Failing
                            its objective, the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> parties or
                            elements thereof could turn to armed resistance.</p>
                        <p>In general, the possibility of armed leftist resistance would tend to
                            increase progressively from contingency A to D. The likelihood of a
                            violent reaction from the smaller, more extremist <gloss
                                target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> group and others including the <gloss

                            The <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss> has received assistance from
                            Cuba and has close ties to the Uruguayan Tupamaros and other terrorist
                            organizations. Its long threatened resort to armed struggle as the “only
                            true road to revolution” probably would be carried out whenever it
                            became clear that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            “peaceful path to Socialism” had failed. We believe, however, that a
                            united military could control violent resistance or terrorist acts
                            carried out by the relatively small extreme left.</p>
                        <p>The problem of maintaining public order would be exacerbated if the
                            military were disunited and the larger U.P. political parties opted for
                            armed opposition. This possibility would be more likely under
                            contingency D than under contingencies A through C. The Communists and
                            Radicals in particular probably would be inclined to avoid violence if
                            possible and await another constitutional opportunity to gain power. The
                            Communists, for example, could take comfort in the revolutionary gains
                            already made by the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            regime, much of which is not likely to be undone by a successor

                        <p>In addition to the extreme left, both the Socialist and Communist Party
                            shock brigades and security units possess arms and have some capability
                            to protect party headquarters and key installations. These <pb n="646"
                                facs="0686" xml:id="pg_646"/>units, however, do not encompass large
                            numbers of party militants. <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> sources
                            including <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> have
                            frequently asserted that any coup attempt would be countered by
                            thousands of armed workers who would seize factories and other vital
                            installations to defend the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> Government by force of arms. While much of this
                            can be regarded as tactical rhetoric, the Chilean military are not
                            disposed to dismiss lightly the possibility of having an armed showdown
                            in the streets with thousands of <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>
                            militants. Decisive and united military action could forestall such a
                            situation, while any evidence of military indecision or disunity would
                            tend to increase its chances of occurring. In general, a milder form of
                            military intervention, particularly one which incorporated <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s continuance in office or the

                            would tend to mitigate an armed leftist reaction except for those who
                            are already violence prone.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">General Factors Affecting US Decisions:</p>
                        <p>We expect that any new government resulting from a military intervention
                            would quickly present us with urgent requests for substantial military
                            and economic assistance, based on a badly deteriorated economy and a
                            need to control disorders (of whatever magnitude). We also assume that,
                            to the extent any new government will represent a turn toward
                            moderation, we would wish to respond affirmatively to its needs. Our
                            basic problem would be how to respond positively given our policy and
                            legal constraints and given the magnitude of Chile’s economic problems
                            and financial limitations. We assume, given the nature and magnitude of
                            our bilateral compensation and debt differences, that these constraints
                            would continue for a time at least.</p>
                        <p>Our approach could be to separate out the emergency minimum essential
                            military and economic assistance which could be provided without
                            reference to our bilateral problems. Examples would be riot equipment
                            and relatively small food shipments, such as milk, etc. The more
                            substantial elements of economic assistance such as <gloss
                                target="#t_PL_1">PL</gloss> 480 Title I and <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss> lending would depend on the kind of policy the new
                            government would adopt with respect to the outstanding issues of
                            compensation for expropriated American properties and debt rescheduling.
                            Such a move on our part would also tend to strengthen our position of
                            non-involvement with respect to the change in government.</p>
                        <p>Within the variations included in the range of contingencies, a key
                            factor to any US decision would be whether any new government was
                            essentially a caretaker pending new elections, or whether it intended to
                            remain in power indefinitely. Only in the latter case could the new
                            government be expected to take significant decisions and actions on
                            pending US Chilean issues. In the case of a caretaker government, such
                            issues would probably have to remain pending until the legally consti<pb

                            office. The following factors would have to be weighed:</p>

                        <p>In any of the contingencies listed above, it could be difficult to reach
                            a firm conclusion on this factor, at least at the outset of any new
                            government. Elements to consider would include the new government’s
                            effective control of the national territory (taking into account the

                            Additionally, the new government’s declarations on policy would have a
                            direct bearing on its general image and thus could significantly affect

                        <p>The most important pending bilateral issues are Chile’s failure to pay

                        <p>The Ad Hoc Group believes that regardless of its desires, any successor

                                >Allende</persName> Government on these issues. For obvious reasons,
                            any new government can be expected to stress its nationalism and firm
                            adherence to Chile’s sovereign right to dispose of its natural resources
                            in accordance with its own laws. Thus, it would have to scrupulously
                            avoid any appearance of “selling out”—or already having sold out—to
                            “imperialist pressure”. It is conceivable, however, that it would
                            cooperate in seeking mutually acceptable solutions to our bilateral

                            These charges would be mitigated to the degree that the Chilean military

                            one in which we emphasize the strictly internal nature of, and entirely
                            Chilean responsibility for, developments in that country. We would note

                            and Mobile Training Teams. Such short-term aid could be furnished

                            for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1973. Thus we could possibly
                            respond quickly to a request for small amounts of emergency grant
                            equipment (e.g., under $200,000). Requests for larger amounts would
                            require a reallocation of the $10 million regional ceiling. Eleven
                            countries in Latin America have been proposed for grant matériel in the
                                <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1973 <gloss target="#t_CPD_1"

                        <p>Any new government would be faced with the need for massive balance of
                            payments relief, and can be expected to request major US assistance for
                            this purpose. The total requirement for new assistance, outside of
                            existing credits and debt rescheduling might be in the order of $200
                            million or more to relieve food shortages and maintain domestic
                            production (this is a rough estimate which could vary widely depending
                            on the course of developments). Obviously the US alone would not be able
                            to fill this need even if we were prepared to provide significant
                            assistance, and the total response by all external lenders probably
                            would be inadequate at least over the short run. Thus a severe foreign
                            exchange shortage would probably be a fact of life for any new
                            government in its first months.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> loan pipeline is tied up

                            extensions would be relatively small, however, since the loans are

                            technical problems would have to be resolved in some cases before the

                            up-to-date in its repayments to the Bank (except, of course, for those
                            included in a bilateral rescheduling agreement). Compensation would also
                            be a factor in the Bank’s review of the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"

                        <p>Food imports will be an area of particular concern for any Chilean
                            Government in the coming months. Because of cut-backs in beef and dairy
                            purchases, total food imports in 1973 will probably be down from the
                            projected 1972 level of $350 million. At the same time, imports of such
                            staples as wheat and corn are expected to increase. The major problem
                            will be wheat. Current projections are for one million tons of wheat
                            imports in 1973, which could amount to $100 million with ocean freight.
                            Chile’s principal suppliers might not be able to supply more than
                            one-half of this amount. Thus a new Chilean government could request the
                            US to provide a major portion of its wheat needs, as well as significant
                            amounts of other commodities. Such a request would entail a decision not
                            only on financing (discussed below) but also on distribution of the
                            limited US wheat supply. In order to respond affirmatively we would have
                            to reduce our wheat shipments to other high priority countries.</p>
                        <p>A potential source of long-term financing for food shipments would be
                            Title I of <gloss target="#t_PL_1">PL</gloss> 480. Probable terms for
                            sales to Chile would be up to 20 years. The amount of financing
                            available would be affected, however, by regional expenditure

                            approximately $5 million. However, it is unlikely that the program could
                            be expanded significantly, given worldwide expenditure limitations and
                            the needs of other countries. Also the <persName corresp="#p_HBB_1"

                            financing would be through the Commodity Credit Corporation. While the
                            financial terms are not nearly as attractive as for Title I sales (from
                            one to three years with near-commercial interest rates), there appear to
                            be no statutory restrictions or strict expenditure limitations which
                            would affect sales to Chile.</p>

                            outstanding in several cases, especially for the larger loans, and the

                            in Chile. All of the loans would be tied to specific projects and would
                            provide relatively little balance of payments relief. The US would be
                            required to vote against all of the loans under the terms of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_GRE_1">Gonzalez</persName> Amendment unless
                            there were good faith negotiations or arbitration on compensation.

                            important, but not decisive, effect on the others. Also, if the

                            vote; thus the loans would probably not be presented to the Executive
                            Boards until the Banks were assured that the provisions of both

                            copper earnings. In addition, if Chile agreed to maintain balance of
                            payments equilibrium over the next twelve months and to contain
                            inflation, the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> very likely would

                            possible if Chile agreed to further monetary and financial commitments.
                            These <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> drawings would provide

                        </p>
                        <p>As provided for in the multilateral debt rescheduling agreement of April
                            1972 (Paris Club), we are currently discussing a bilateral debt
                            rescheduling with the Chileans; we are considering the possibility of
                            rescheduling 70% of the repayments falling due within the November
                            1971–December 1972 period at a consolidation interest rate of 6.6%.
                            While the signature of such an agreement would mean an immediate balance
                            of payments drain since Chile would have to resume payment on part of
                            its debt to the US, it might help Chile obtain additional assistance
                            through the successful completion of another debt rescheduling exercise
                            or through new credits.</p>
                        <p>Multilateral talks on rescheduling Chile’s 1973 debt payments currently
                            are scheduled for December 1972. These talks might be postponed if any
                            new government took office. This would probably have the effect of
                            giving Chile nearly 100% relief on its debt repayments to the major
                            creditor countries, since during 1972 it has generally withheld
                            repayments until bilateral rescheduling agreements are signed. If the
                            talks were held in December or at some later date, our position would in
                            great part be determined by the commitments on compensation that Chile
                            would be prepared to make.</p>

                        <p>The appointment of three military officers to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s new cabinet has eased
                            tensions and paved the way for an early settlement of the almost
                            four-week-old strike. Settlement of the strike and the military’s new
                            role in the government should bring about moderation of the polarized
                            political atmosphere, with political attention turning increasingly to
                            congressional elections in March 1973. However, with debt renegotiations
                            scheduled for December, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            will step up his efforts to divert blame for increasingly serious
                            economic problems by focusing attention on “foreign economic
                            aggressors.”</p>

                            Commander in Chief <persName corresp="#p_PGC_1">Carlos Prats</persName>
                            into the government as Minister of Interior—and next in line to succeed
                            the President—will reassure opposition elements that their views on key
                            issues will be taken into account in government decisions between now
                            and the March elections. Opposition leaders, including former President
                            Frei, have been quick to approve of the military’s decision to enter the
                            government. At the same time, the appointment is a setback for <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s Socialist Party, which has
                            repeatedly opposed bringing the military into the government or any
                            attempts to moderate the Popular Unity program. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PGC_1">Prats</persName> announced that his acceptance of
                            military participation in the cabinet does not reflect a political
                            commitment by the military but is rather “a patriotic contribution
                            toward social peace.” He considers military participation as an interim
                            measure designed to assure that the electoral process will provide a way
                            out of the current impasse. He and most other Chileans now clearly see
                            the scheduled March 1973 congressional elections as a plebiscite which
                            will determine Chile’s future course.</p>

                        <p>Throughout the confrontation of the past weeks, <persName

                            unwieldy decision-making mechanism of his coalition. The Socialist Party
                            seemed particularly unprepared and disorganized, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> relied largely on the more
                            moderate Communists and the trade unions for support. Moreover, the
                            Socialists consistently opposed <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s efforts to compromise with the strikers.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s concession to the
                            opposition with regard both to specific issues raised by the strikers
                            and to government policies between now and the March elections will
                            likely intensify strains between moderates and hardliners in his
                            coalition. Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_PGC_1">Prats</persName>’
                            stated promise to “repress excesses of extremists from the left or
                            right” may well contribute to intensifying these strains, especially if
                            the military actively apply recently passed legislation restricting and
                            controlling private ownership of weapons.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">The Strike: No Winners</hi>. In appointing nine new
                            members to his fifteen-man cabinet, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> removed several Ministers who were especially
                            objectionable to the opposition, but retained others who are ideological
                            supporters of continued expansion of the government’s control over the
                            economy. Moreover, it remains to be seen whether the various elements of
                            the coalition can be made to live up to the terms of the agreement
                            apparently reached by <persName corresp="#p_PGC_1">Prats</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s yielding to some strike
                            demands does not preclude that some of the firms requisitioned by the
                            government will be retained under state control. Economic pressures
                            against other important firms, such as the nation’s paper producing
                            company, may continue. Thus, the outcome will probably not be entirely
                            satisfactory to either side. However, there is a clear awareness that
                            continued confrontation will be seriously damaging to the interests of
                            all concerned.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">A Search for a Scapegoat</hi>. Post-strike political
                            attention will almost certainly be directed toward the electoral
                            campaign, in which the chief issues will be those posed by the
                            government’s continuing threats to political liberties and the private
                            sector, as well as by the deteriorating economic situation. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> will undoubtedly seek to
                            defuse the economic issue by stepping up his efforts to shift blame for
                            economic hardships to “foreign economic aggressors,” emphasizing
                            continued international credit stringencies and trade grievances. The
                            secret round of debt renegotiations scheduled for December will tempt
                            him to take a stridently “anti-imperialist” posture and, possibly, to
                            use the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General Assembly as his

                        <p>1. Summary: Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName>
                            made strong appeal to me for an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> invitation to Washington or a call on him in New
                            York by the Secretary or Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1"
                                >Letelier</persName> described <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> trip as a crossroads—a critical opportunity
                            which <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> should take to preserve its
                            rels with Chile from serious damage. End summary.</p>
                        <p>2. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> spent
                            almost three hours at lunch today making appeal that “historic
                            opportunity” of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> trip not
                            be lost. He said he talked with <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1"
                                >FonMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AMC_1">Almeyda</persName>, but had not yet had
                            opportunity to consult Pres <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> (who has been in Valparaiso during past day or
                            two). He alleged he was acting on his own, trying to fulfill his
                            responsibility as Amb to our country and preserve our relations from
                            serious damage.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> began by saying
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s trip had both
                            internal and external significance. Internally it would show once and
                            for all that this regime has institutional stability—including military
                            support and that the Chilean people must face up to the reality of four
                            more years of their present govt. Pres <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> will leave the country and return and nothing
                            will have happened. This fact alone will have immense political
                            importance.</p>
                        <p>4. Turning to external side, <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1"
                                >Letelier</persName> painted picture of great <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> success in Mexico, <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> speech which will be interpreted in
                            David and Goliath terms vis-à-vis <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>,
                            open <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> snub, warmly successful visit
                            to <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> accompanied by significant
                            announcement of credits, visit to Cuba and <persName corresp="#p_CF_1"
                                >Fidel Castro</persName>, and then home. Impression given will be a
                            turning to the East, and a moving away from Chile’s present effort to
                            maintain a balanced policy.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> went on to describe
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> trip as a
                            crossroads—“the moment of truth”. After it, things will not be the same.
                            Either it will be an opportunity to improve our relationship, or it will
                            make things much worse. We should be under no illusion that we are not
                            at a <pb n="656" facs="0696" xml:id="pg_656"/>turning point, <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> said. He stopped short of
                            describing the negative consequences in truly apocalyptic terms, and
                            reiterated several times during our conversation that he did not mean
                            that the Chilean Govt would deliberately turn to a policy of sharpening
                            its longest knives. Rather, he said, the dynamic of things and the
                            balance of forces within the Chilean Govt would inevitably make things
                            “much harder.” In our conversation <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1"
                                >Letelier</persName> reverted again and again to the “historic
                            moment” theme and the crucial importance of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> trip and our response to
                            it.</p>
                        <p>6. During the foregoing (considerably condensed) remarks, I said very
                            little. I did observe at one point that it looked as if the essential
                            character of President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            trip was pretty well established by now. <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1"
                                >Letelier</persName> took issue with me with considerable heat,
                            saying that both the trip’s political impact and the President’s speech
                            in New York would be debated within the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> in the days ahead. At another point I expressed some
                            mystification that the Chilean Govt had handled matters the way it had
                            if its intention was to seek a dialogue with us. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> picked me up sharply, and
                            asked exactly what I had in mind. I said I did not know Washington’s
                            views, but I personally questioned whether the language of Chile’s
                            recent note to us or the spate of press stories seeming to pressure US
                            publicly were the ideal way to approach a dialogue. I mentioned my
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_AMC_1">Almeyda</persName>
                            (Santiago 5046) and said my impression was that the Chilean Govt meant
                            what it said when it announced President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s trip to the United Nations as a visit focussed
                            on that world forum. <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName>
                            said we should have taken the initiative. He claimed that there were
                            practically no precedents for a chief of government or chief of state of
                            a country with which we maintain normal relations visiting New York
                            without an invitation to Washington or a meeting with U.S.
                            representatives at an extremely high level. I said that was not my
                            impression, recalling one or two examples. <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1"
                                >Letelier</persName> retorted by saying he did not think I could
                            name more than about two. (Action request: I would appreciate additional
                            background by telegram on precedents for use with <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> and others within the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>.)</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> then talked in
                            somewhat fuzzy terms about an <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> meeting with <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> representatives. While an invitation to Washington to
                            meet with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> was
                            obviously what he would like to see, he did say that a visit to New York
                            by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> or a “White
                            House representative” (i.e. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>) would, he thought, be regarded positively. He
                            went on: “I believe that any possible idea of having Assistant Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName> call on our President
                            would not be so regarded, and it would be preferable not to propose it.”
                            He added that he had the highest regard for Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>, and the concern was frankly one
                            of level. I made no comment to any of this.</p>
                        <pb n="657" facs="0697" xml:id="pg_657"/>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> said that the
                            impression the United States was making in quite a few Chilean Govt
                            circles was one of indifference, perhaps deliberate delay, and perhaps
                            even a desire not to work out our differences. I asked him where we had
                            dragged our feet. He said the technical negotiations on debt
                            renegotiation with the EXIM Bank and others had given something of that
                            impression. I said that, speaking of impressions, I had the feeling that
                            the Chilean Govt sometimes gave an impression of concentrating more on
                            formulas of contact than on substantive positions which the Chilean Govt
                            would have to change if we were to come to a mutual accommodation.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> acknowledged my
                            point, and said he thought the Chilean Govt was prepared to make
                            substantive proposals if the opportunity of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> trip were not missed. He
                            hinted that military entry into the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                            could affect Chilean positions for the better. I asked if <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> could give me any indication
                            of what he had in mind in terms of substance, observing that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> seemed to be boxing itself in.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> mentioned the 1914
                            arbitration treaty, and asked what we thought of it. I said our lawyers
                            in Washington saw a number of problems—including the rather lengthy
                            mediation procedure, the reservation of questions affecting sovereignty
                            and the lack of a clear prompt mechanism for reaching a decisive
                            conclusion. <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> answered
                            that there were a lot of ways to skin a cat, and with our orderly
                            Anglo-Saxon minds we should be able to find a way to work forward
                            systematically to agreement. The important thing, he said, was that the
                            1914 treaty provided an “out” for the Chilean Govt in terms of being a
                            treaty in force. We had to realize, he said, that a direct assault on
                            the Chilean constitution would not get either of us anywhere. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> added that he was not
                            speaking for <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AMC_1">Almeyda</persName> or the Chilean Govt in
                            connection with the 1914 treaty.</p>
                        <p>9. I told <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> I had
                            requested an appointment with <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AMC_1">Almeyda</persName> and would deliver our
                            answer to Chile’s note of October 18, 1972. I said it would respond
                            favorably to the Chilean desire for a bilateral discussion. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> asked whether it would
                            address the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> visit. I
                            said that Chile’s October 18 proposal was quite explicit in terms of the
                            level of delegation Chile desired. <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1"
                                >Letelier</persName> said that Chile’s note was prepared before the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> trip was settled on
                            (which I do not believe was the case). He did not indicate any
                            opposition to talks, but made it very clear that he in no way wished to
                            be deflected from the overriding importance he placed on the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> trip and our response to
                            it.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1">Letelier</persName> said that he had
                            given Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1">Meyer</persName>
                            some indication of his hope that our response to the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> trip would be positive. He
                            still hopes that I may be able to give him some encouraging word before
                            he leaves Chile for Washington at the end of this week.</p>

                            will make things harder. It is sad that the Chilean Govt has structured
                            it that way if not with care at least with weeks of tinkling cymbals—and
                            is now turning to us with heat and pressure to change the impression it

                            considering if the Secretary’s schedule allows. What it might do is
                            avoid atmospherics which <persName corresp="#p_LSO_1"

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s current
                            2-week trip to Mexico, the UN, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss>, and Cuba is designed to bolster his domestic
                            political position by pleading Chile’s cause before the world community
                            as an aggrieved nation struggling for a more just social system. He also
                            hopes to obtain new foreign credits by softening the attitudes of
                            Chile’s Western creditors and/or by winning massive assistance from the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. His trip is unlikely,
                            however, to satisfy in any significant way either his political or
                            economic requirements, and he will probably find the harsh realities of
                            his position basically unchanged upon the conclusion of the trip.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Contradictions in Purpose.</hi> As he has done so
                            often in the past, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is
                            attempting to obtain two highly dissimilar results. He wants to reaffirm
                            his credentials as a revolutionary leader in order to rally his
                            supporters at home. By visiting centers of socialism and revolution,
                            including “technical stops” in Peru and Algeria, he hopes to dramatize
                            his position as a leader of the developing world beleaguered and stymied
                            by “foreign economic aggression.” On the other hand, he apparently hopes
                            for tolerance and understanding among Western nations, including the
                            United States, at a time when his country desperately needs foreign
                            credits to meet import requirements.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s trip follows closely
                            on a major domestic confrontation which ended only after the Armed
                            Forces agreed to participate in his Cabinet in a significant way. The
                            strike was costly to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            because it added to economic dislocations and because the concessions he
                            made to his opposition intensified the strains in his Popular Unity
                            coalition. These strains may increase, depending upon the manner in
                            which Acting President (General) <persName corresp="#p_PGC_1"
                                >Prats</persName> attempts to settle outstanding issues during
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s absence.</p>
                        <p>With the military’s participation in the Cabinet providing a basis for
                            stability, attention will now be focussed increasingly on the March
                            Congressional elections. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            is probably realistic about his poor prospects of reducing the
                            Opposition’s majority in both houses of congress. Given the likelihood
                            of continuing bleak economic conditions, his only hope is to convert his
                            aggressive stance against multinational corporations to the advantage of
                            his followers. In this respect, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s trip is a dramatic means of launching the

                            against Cuba are expected. He will also probably repeat the attack he

                            deal appears unlikely, both because of strenuous opposition in Chile and
                            because the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will hesitate to

                        <p>The basic U.S. interests in Chile are to prevent the consolidation of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime; to minimize
                            the acceptance and emulation elsewhere of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime; to protect the major
                            principles of our in<pb n="661" facs="0701" xml:id="pg_661"/>ternational
                            economic policy—the honoring of debt obligations and the payment of just
                            compensation for expropriated investment; to protect the immediate
                            financial stake in Chile of U.S. agencies (Eximbank, <gloss
                                target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss>, etc.) of approximately $1.1 billion; and to obtain
                            just compensation for expropriated properties in Chile.</p>
                        <p>In pursuit of these interests, we seek to maximize pressure on the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> Government while
                            maintaining a correct but cool posture. Thus, pressure is to be tempered
                            by restraint so that measures intended to prevent consolidation of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime do not in
                            fact contribute to its consolidation of power or its ability to rally
                            support. Our policy on Chile has proven reasonably successful to date
                            and has been so acknowledged by our friends in Chile and elsewhere in
                            the world. The unvarying advice we continue to receive from <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s opponents and those who wish
                            us well is to continue on the course we have taken.</p>
                        <p>Against the background of the copper dispute, the immediate issues to be
                            resolved by the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> are whether to
                            conclude and sign a bilateral debt rescheduling agreement with Chile for
                            the November 1971–December 1972 debt and to prepare for an anticipated
                            meeting in January with other creditor nations to discuss the payments
                            due in 1973.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background:</p>
                        <p>Following a unilateral moratorium on its external debt payments by Chile
                            in November 1971, the twelve major creditor nations agreed in Paris in
                            April 1972 to reschedule approximately $160 million of debt owed them by
                            Chile from November 1971 through December 1972; the US share amounted to
                            approximately $69 million, of which Eximbank accounted for $62 million,
                                <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> for $3 million, and <gloss
                                target="#t_PL480_1">PL–480</gloss> $4 million. (An additional $3.2
                            million in <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> credits may be
                            rescheduled separately under somewhat different terms.) It now appears
                            that all other creditor nations except the United States have concluded,
                            or are about to conclude imminently, their bilateral rescheduling
                            agreements with Chile under the overall terms of the Paris
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>After strenuous negotiations the US succeeded at Paris in having the
                            agreement include clauses in which the Government of Chile agreed to
                            recognize and pay its debts, “to carry out direct negotiations for the
                            purpose of finding a prompt solution” to problems involving compensation
                            for expropriated properties, and “to grant just compensation in
                            accordance with Chilean legislation and international law”.</p>
                        <p>The refusal of the special Chilean copper tribunal to review the
                            President’s findings against Kennecott and Anaconda on alleged excess
                            profits effectively foreclosed any local Chilean resolution of the
                            problem of compensation for the major US copper investments. Following
                            this, the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> in a note of September 15
                            asked the Government <pb n="662" facs="0702" xml:id="pg_662"/>of Chile
                            to enter into direct negotiations with the companies on copper
                            compensation in accordance with its Paris Club commitment cited above.
                            The Chilean reply of October 18 was polemical in tone and indicated that
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> considered its domestic legal
                            processes with respect to compensation conformed with international law.
                            Nevertheless, the Government of Chile offered to enter into
                            “wide-ranging discussions in Washington, through its Ambassador,
                            accompanied by a high level political mission, on the questions
                            affecting relations between the two countries.” In our note of November
                            22 we proposed that such talks begin during the week of December 11. Our
                            note outlined in a firm but unpolemical tone the US position on
                            obligations under international law on compensation for expropriated
                            investment and made it plain that we intend to discuss the copper
                            expropriation in the proposed talks. In reply, Chilean Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_AMC_1">Almeyda</persName> told Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DN_1">Davis</persName> that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> is prepared to make a “strong effort
                            to achieve an understanding” at these meetings, which are now
                            tentatively scheduled to begin during the week of December 18.</p>
                        <p>We began bilateral debt rescheduling talks with the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> in Washington in June 1972. After an
                            initial exchange of views and data there was a lapse of several months
                            before the talks were resumed on October 2. There are no major
                            differences regarding the USDA and <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>
                            debt, and agreement was quickly reached on possible terms for
                            rescheduling the <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> arrearages. After
                            considerable effort, the principal differences on the Eximbank debt have
                            been narrowed and now appear close to resolution. The remaining major
                            issue is the interest rate which can probably be negotiated.</p>
                        <p>The Paris Club was originally scheduled to meet again in December, if
                            called by the Government of Chile, to examine Chile’s economic
                            situation, fulfillment of commitments under the April agreement, and the
                            need for a further rescheduling. Chile has not yet requested such a
                            meeting. It is likely that with or without a request from Chile, the
                            creditors will meet in January to consider their response to a probable
                            nonpayment by Chile of international obligations falling due from
                            January 1, 1973 on.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">US Position for Coming Months:</p>
                        <p>Consistent with basic US policy outlined above, US strategy is designed
                            to avoid actions which could be used by the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> Government to influence the March 1973
                            Parliamentary elections in its favor. At the same time, we wish to
                            continue pursuing our objectives of obtaining compensation for
                            expropriated properties and maintaining maximum international economic
                            pressure on Chile.</p>
                        <p>Since the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> has agreed to direct
                            negotiations on December 18 and has not sought to exclude discussion of
                            copper, we believe it would <pb n="663" facs="0703" xml:id="pg_663"/>be
                            to the US advantage to proceed to resolve the remaining technical issues
                            and sign a bilateral debt rescheduling agreement with Chile for the
                            November 1971–December 1972 period, if possible before the December 18
                            talks begin. If we are not able to sign before December 18 we would hope
                            to sign before the next Paris Club round, assuming that the high level
                            talks proceed satisfactorily. An agreement prior to December 18 would
                            put us in a more favorable tactical position for those talks. Agreement
                            on rescheduling for 1972 would commit the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> to resume payments on debts owed to <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> agencies for the cited period (Chile
                            now is enjoying total relief from these obligations) and thereby would
                            increase the existing economic pressures on the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss>; it would demonstrate US compliance with the Paris Club
                            agreement; it would avoid possible isolation of the US from the other
                            creditor nations; and it would deny <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> a basis for charging economic aggression.</p>
                        <p>The US would then emphasize at Paris our hope that the
                            government-to-government talks will yield satisfactory progress on the
                            compensation issue. We would also seek to obtain useful statements from
                            the other creditors on the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>-Chilean
                            talks. We can expect that at Paris other creditor countries—particularly
                            Britain and Germany—will be highly critical of Chile’s economic
                            performance and policies. A factor particularly disturbing to other
                            creditors because of its international implications is Chile’s continued
                            repudiation of certain debts to US copper companies.</p>
                        <p>We would hope to have maximum international criticism of Chile’s economic
                            policies aired at the Paris meetings. At this moment, it appears that it
                            would be desirable to have the meetings extend through the March
                            elections before reaching a decision on a rescheduling for 1973. The
                            precise timing and terms of a 1973 rescheduling and conditions to be

                            and with Chile in the coming months. We would factor into our position

                            forthcoming high-level talks with Chile. There are too many
                            uncertainties in the situation for us to define our position within the

                                    leading up to the March 1973 congressional elections. It
                                    predicted a split in the senatorial race that could pose
                                    problems for U.S. interests in the future. It then concluded
                                    with a proposal to financially support opposition parties in
                                    Chile.</p>

                        <p>1. This memorandum on the electoral campaign contains our current
                            estimates on the outcome of the various races, the status of our funding
                            and expenditures, and a proposal for funding private sector elements to
                            have them play a role in the campaign.</p>

                        <p>We foresee a 14–11 split (16–9 at present). The critical senatorial races
                            are the fourth, sixth and eighth districts where it is conceivable that
                                <gloss target="#t_CODE_1">CODE</gloss> could pick up the fourth
                            senatorial seat. 67 or 68 percent of the total vote is needed. The
                            weakest candidates are: Mercado (second district), Labbe (fourth
                            district), <persName corresp="#p_VAJ_1">Velasco</persName> (seventh

                        <p>We foresee a 88–62 split (93–57 at present). The opposition could pick up
                            as many as 6 above the base of 88. After that it gets extremely
                            difficult.</p>

                        <p>Among the deputy races there are no races that are considered “critical”
                            in the provinces returning five deputies because the opposition does not
                            believe it has enough electoral strength (68 percent) to win the fourth
                            seat. The same principle applies to the deputy races in which the
                            provinces return two or three deputies (with the possible exception of
                            Maule (3).) The critical deputy races are for the third seat in the
                            provinces returning four deputies (Colchagua, Linares, Bio-Bio), the
                            fourth seat of six deputies (O’Higgins, Malleco), the fourth seat of
                            seven (Antofagasta, Coquimbo), the sixth seat of nine (Concepcion), the
                            seventh seat of ten (Cautin), the seventh seat of twelve (Valparaiso),
                            and the eleventh seat of 18 (Santiago). In these races a <gloss

                            probably win the contested seat.</p>

                            is proposed that these funds be provided for this purpose without

                        <p>1. The following are the Santiago Station’s replies to the questions you
                            raised on 10 January 1973 in connection with the Station’s proposals for
                            funding [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>2. [<hi rend="italic">4½ lines not declassified</hi>]. Many Chileans,
                            especially those members of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] whose party loyalties are weak, are saying that
                            the March 1973 elections will not really solve anything. A special
                            effort is required to counter this possible voter apathy and to try to
                            maximize this sector’s electoral participation. Funds provided [<hi
                                rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] would be used as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>A. To make a special appeal to individual [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                line not declassified</hi>] members pointing out the importance of
                            the elections and of their individual votes. This appeal would be
                            conducted through various media, including radio, press, television and
                            leaflets.</p>
                        <p>B. To enable [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]
                            leaders to travel and to fund local person-to-person efforts to convince
                            members to participate in the elections and to mobilize them for this
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>C. To provide transportation and whatever other assistance is required on
                            election day to assure that members get to the polls.</p>
                        <p>3. Under no circumstances will any funds be made available to Patria y
                            Libertad, which does not form part of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                line not declassified</hi>]. This has been a standing and inflexible
                            policy of the Santiago Station.</p>
                        <p>4. With regard to the proposed use of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount
                                not declassified</hi>] of the contingency fund to provide additional
                            campaign assistance to the Democratic Radical Party (<gloss
                                target="#t_PDR_1">PDR</gloss>), the Station believes that this
                            proposed support is essential to enable the <gloss target="#t_PDR_1"
                                >PDR</gloss> to make the strongest possible campaign effort. These
                            funds are especially important for senatorial races since the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDR_1">PDR</gloss> is running three candidates (Julio
                            Mercado—2nd District; Julio Duran—8th District; Raul Morales—10th
                            District). In each of these races the <gloss target="#t_PDR_1"
                                >PDR</gloss> candidates seem to be among the weakest <pb n="667"
                                facs="0707" xml:id="pg_667"/>opposition links to winning extra
                            senatorial seats. Opposition ability to capture an additional seat in
                            these districts appears to hinge on a strong campaign effort by <gloss
                                target="#t_PDR_1">PDR</gloss>, and the Station requested additional
                            funds to make sure this effort is made.</p>
                        <p>5. Unfortunately the <gloss target="#t_PDR_1">PDR</gloss> badly
                            underestimated its needs. The party failed to allow for significant
                            price rise of recent months, assuming that the black market rate would
                            keep pace with inflation spiral. In addition, the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDR_1">PDR</gloss>’s plans were based on the belief that
                            the <gloss target="#t_PDR_1">PDR</gloss> would run only two senatorial
                            candidates. The party did not anticipate that <gloss target="#t_CODE_1"

                        <p>On 26 October 1972 the 40 Committee approved $1,427,666 to support
                            political parties and private sector organizations opposed to the
                            Popular Unity (<gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>) coalition of
                            President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Salvador Allende</persName> in
                            the 4 March 1973 congressional elections. The funds requested at that
                            time for each opposition party were based on detailed reviews of
                            campaign <pb n="668" facs="0708" xml:id="pg_668"/>budgets prepared by
                            each organization and were considered to be realistic in terms of
                            opposition needs.</p>
                        <p>Since October 1972 there has been a sharp and unforeseeable rise in many
                            costs. Campaign materials, such as paints and printing inks, are so
                            scarce that competing parties must pay “under the table” prices to
                            insure an adequate supply. Prices of radio and press advertising have
                            risen, as well as costs of services and transportation. [<hi
                                rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>]. The efforts of the
                            opposition parties and their candidates have been highly effective thus
                            far, but an additional [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>] is required to permit the two major opposition
                            parties to conduct the campaign at the level required in the final stage
                            of the campaign as well as on election day. Of the additional [<hi
                                rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] being requested,
                                [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] would be
                            allocated to the Christian Democratic Party (<gloss target="#t_PDC_1"

                        <p>This proposal has the concurrence of the U.S. Ambassador to Chile and the

                        <p>In early January 1973, increased costs forced the opposition parties to
                            begin reviewing their campaign budgets, and it became evident that the

                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> has made significant progress
                            in this regard. Basic data on some 125,000 <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> members have been recorded in the party’s IBM computer

                            due primarily to the personalistic management of <gloss target="#t_PN_1"

                        <p>Despite some kinks, the opposition parties are campaigning well and are
                            optimistic about their election prospects. They believe they have a good

                            while the Communist Party, which has been quite accurate in previous

                        <p>On balance, there is good reason for opposition optimism at the moment,

                                >UP</gloss> coalition is suffering from internal dissension, while

                            friction. The government, however, has just begun to implement its
                            electoral strategy. The government realizes that the basic election
                            issues relate to economic matters—specifically, to inflation and to the
                            shortages of essential consumer goods, particularly foodstuffs. Thus,
                            the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> is in the process of initiating
                            an all-out propaganda campaign blaming consumer shortages and a parallel
                            black market on hoarding by middle and upper class Chileans. This
                            campaign features daily stories about government discoveries of
                            foodstuffs being withheld from the legal market, with banner headlines
                            and photographs illustrating the effectiveness of government action in
                                im<pb n="670" facs="0710" xml:id="pg_670"/>pounding the vast
                            quantities of such items. <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> success in
                            locating and confiscating hoarded material has actually been limited.
                            Nonetheless, it is expected that the government will soon release to the
                            public large quantities of food it has stored in warehouses throughout
                            the country, claiming that this is the result of its anti-hoarding
                            campaign. In this manner, the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> hopes
                            not only to decrease public discontent over shortages but to relate the
                            increased availability of food to government action against black
                            marketeers, who will be portrayed as supporters of the political
                            opposition. While this strategy may be transparent to some Chileans, it
                            is likely that many, especially in the lower income sector, will give
                            some credence to government claims. This type of tactic, plus more
                            active electioneering on the part of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, will probably give the <gloss

                            of the campaign.</p>
                        <p>The Station’s basic objective will continue to be to insure that each
                            opposition candidate conducts the most effective campaign possible in
                            order to assure the highest possible popular vote for the opposition
                            confederation. The opposition forces have set an optimum goal of
                            attaining a two-thirds majority in the Senate; and while it is unlikely
                            they will realize this, Station electoral strategy is also designed to
                            attempt to achieve this objective.</p>

                            describe their interview on 15 March with Senator Church and Messrs.
                            Levinson and Blum of Senator Church’s Sub-committee Staff. According to
                            the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> representatives, the Senator
                            had agreed that the questions to be put to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss> would, at least for the present, focus on the question
                            of <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> /<gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss> relationships in 1970. The <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss> representatives at the meeting with Church were Messrs.
                            Houston, <persName corresp="#p_ST_1">Shackley</persName>, <persName

                        <p>The account of the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> session with
                            Church and his staff came largely from <persName corresp="#p_ST_1"
                                >Shackley</persName>, supplemented from time to time by Houston.
                            Both spoke from notes that each had made.</p>
                        <p>Senator Church started matters off by asking <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1"
                                >Broe</persName> to relate the circumstances of his meeting with
                                <persName corresp="#p_GHS_1">Geneen</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> replied that he had given
                                <persName corresp="#p_GHS_1">Geneen</persName> an overview of the
                            situation in Chile, and that <persName corresp="#p_GHS_1"
                                >Geneen</persName> had commented on these same subjects. There was a
                            discussion of the three Presidential candidates. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GHS_1">Geneen</persName> referred to the availability of
                            an election fund that might be available from the US business community,
                            but no figure was set. <persName corresp="#p_GHS_1">Geneen</persName>
                            asked if <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> could channel such funds
                            to Alessandri. <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> said no,
                            that it was not US policy to support any particular candidate. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GHS_1">Geneen</persName> asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> to keep in touch with Gerrity.
                            The entire <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName>–<persName
                                corresp="#p_GHS_1">Geneen</persName> conversation lasted something
                            less than an hour. <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> said
                            that he had had a later conversation with <persName corresp="#p_GHS_1"
                                >Geneen</persName> over the telephone but that it too was concerned
                            with generalities, with bringing up to date the matters the two earlier
                            had discussed.</p>
                        <pb n="674" facs="0714" xml:id="pg_674"/>
                        <p>The rest of the interrogation of <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1"
                                >Broe</persName> seems to have been carried on chiefly by Levinson,
                            Church having left after 5 or 10 minutes.</p>
                        <p>Levinson asked about the circumstances of <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1"
                                >Broe</persName>’s getting in touch with Merriam. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> said that Merriam had taken the
                            initiative, had called him; he also told the Committee Staff that he had
                            had a series of lunch sessions, some five in all, with Merriam during
                            the period under discussion.</p>
                        <p>Levinson asked if <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> and
                            Merriam had discussed the question of the effect on <gloss
                                target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> if <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> were elected. <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1"
                                >Broe</persName> said that this question had been discussed only in
                            general terms.</p>
                        <p>Going back to the <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName>–<persName
                                corresp="#p_GHS_1">Geneen</persName> talk, Levinson asked if
                                <persName corresp="#p_GHS_1">Geneen</persName> had raised the
                            question of expropriation. <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName>
                            said no. Did <persName corresp="#p_GHS_1">Geneen</persName> mention a
                            figure in connection with the election fund that he had mentioned?
                            No.</p>
                        <p>Did <persName corresp="#p_GHS_1">Geneen</persName> ask what plans <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> had if <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> won? No.</p>
                        <p>Levinson wanted to know what happened next. <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1"
                                >Broe</persName> said that Merriam had asked him to lunch and that
                            in all their sessions they discussed principally the trends and
                            developments in Chile, the question of economic forces at work there.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> commented that in these
                            discussions Merriam frequently had recourse to documents from <gloss
                                target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> representatives in Chile.</p>
                        <p>Levinson wanted to know if <persName corresp="#p_MJ_1">McCone</persName>
                            had ever discussed the Chilean electoral situation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_HR_1">Helms</persName> or with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> replied that he had no knowledge
                            one way or the other about whether there had been any such
                            conversations.</p>
                        <p>When had the first contact been made with Gerrity? <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> replied that it had taken place
                            on 30 September, when the two had talked about the Chilean situation and
                            about whether there were any pressures that could be exerted that would
                            help the situation. The discussion was an exchange of ideas, a
                            brain-storming session. No agreement of any sort had been reached
                            between the two.</p>
                        <p>Levinson referred to a Gerrity/<persName corresp="#p_GHS_1"
                                >Geneen</persName> cable of 29 September which had a reference to
                            the effect that <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> had given <gloss
                                target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> a list of companies. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> commented that he might well have
                            given <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> such a list, but he had no
                            recollection about what the purpose of such a list might have been.</p>
                        <p>Did <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> say, as is stated in one
                            of the <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> memoranda, that <gloss
                                target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> was the only company being responsive
                            to the situation in Chile? <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName>
                            said that he had noted that <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> was the
                            only company that had come to the US Government and was the only one
                            that had mentioned funds.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question from Levinson, <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1"
                                >Broe</persName> said that he discussed <gloss target="#t_ITT_1"
                                >ITT</gloss> actions with Merriam, commenting that some moves were
                                <pb n="675" facs="0715" xml:id="pg_675"/>sound; but that none of his
                            comments could be construed as “approval”.</p>
                        <p>The staff seemed to be particularly interested to learn if <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> had sent somebody to Merriam’s
                            office to pick up an assessment on Chile. <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1"
                                >Broe</persName> replied that he had done so, that such assessments
                            from a non-<gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> source could be quite
                            useful as a cross-check. The document had been discussed at lunch;
                            Merriam had forgotten to bring it with him.</p>
                        <p>The Staff hammered on <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName>’s
                            claim that the telephone calls between <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1"
                                >Broe</persName> and Merriam all came at Merriam’s initiative.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> was emphatic in
                            insisting that this was so; each contact had been initiated by Merriam.
                            Levinson noted that he felt this to be a major inconsistency with the
                            claims made by <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss>, which appears to
                            have maintained that the initiative consistently lay with <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Staff had an October 6 internal <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss>
                            memorandum prepared by one Ryan, described as a Merriam deputy.
                            According to this memorandum, Ryan had received a phone call from
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> said that he did not recall
                            talking to Ryan; since he had no memory of doing so the only explanation
                            he could think of was that he had thought he was talking with Merriam
                            when in fact he might have been talking to Ryan. According to Ryan’s
                            memorandum, <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> had said that
                            “we” should be keeping pressure on the Chileans, with the implication
                            that the pressure referred to was economic. This alleged statement
                            seemed to bother the Committee considerably. In this same memo, Ryan
                            also stated that <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> had said
                            that the military “might do something”. <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1"
                                >Broe</persName> commented that he couldn’t have spoken so about the
                            military if for no other reason than that he had always felt that the
                            military would do nothing.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> was next asked if he had
                            discussed inspiring a run on Chilean banks with <gloss target="#t_ITT_1"
                                >ITT</gloss> representatives. <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1"
                                >Broe</persName> said that he had not. He did say, however, that he
                            had taken the initiative in bringing up the question of economic
                            pressure as a means of attempting to accelerate the deterioration of the
                            economic situation in Chile.</p>
                        <p>The Committee wanted to know where the suggestion for economic pressure
                            had come from? Had it come from <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName>? To this <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1"
                                >Broe</persName> said that he had no idea who had originated the
                            concept, but it had been widely discussed within Chile and it had been
                            discussed as well within the US Government. The matter had arisen
                            particularly after the Alessandri/Frei ploy had died.</p>
                        <p>The Committee wanted to know if <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1"
                                >Broe</persName> had developed a plan for action that he had
                            discussed with <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss>. No.</p>
                        <p>The Committee referred to an October 7 memo from Merriam to Gerrity
                            referring to “our man”. Merriam apparently had said that this reference
                            was to <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName>; this could be a
                            point of controversy because whoever “our man” was had, according to the
                            memo, spoken about conversations with General Motors, Ford, and a
                            California bank, as<pb n="676" facs="0716" xml:id="pg_676"/>sumed to be
                            the Bank of America. <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> said
                            that he had made no contact in this period with these concerns, nor had
                            any one else in <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>. This apparently
                            contrasted with Merriam’s statement to the Committee that <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> had told him that he, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName>, had made these calls (<persName
                                corresp="#p_ST_1">Shackley</persName> commented at this point in the
                            meeting with <gloss target="#t_ARA_1">ARA</gloss> that <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> had no institutional memory of any
                            such contacts having been made by it.) The Committee pressed hard on
                            this point, presumably under the impression that there could well have
                            been a Government-business conspiracy.</p>
                        <p>Did <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> ask <gloss
                                target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> to lobby other US Government agencies
                            in regard to Chile? Emphatically no.</p>
                        <p>(<persName corresp="#p_ST_1">Shackley</persName> commented that all the
                            contradictions that allegedly marked the statements of <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> as contrasted to those of <gloss
                                target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> lay within the framework of the
                                Merriam–<persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> talks).</p>
                        <p>Levinson said that <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> had talked to
                                <persName corresp="#p_VVP_1">Vaky</persName> and to people in State,
                            and had had some statement made on the floor of the House. He also
                            understood that Merriam had tried to see <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>. (The implication was that the try was
                            unsuccessful).</p>
                        <p>To a question about an October 9 exchange between Merriam and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ_1">McCone</persName> and the possibility of a
                            military uprising, <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> said
                            that this matter had not come up in his talks with <gloss
                                target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss>. He reminded the Committee that the
                            Agency consistently had held that a military uprising would not
                            occur.</p>
                        <p>The Committee Staff said that <persName corresp="#p_MJ_1"
                                >McCone</persName> had told the Committee of a comment by <persName
                                corresp="#p_GHS_1">Geneen</persName> in December 1970 about a
                            “generals’ revolt” and economic activity. According to Houston, the
                            Staff said that <persName corresp="#p_GHS_1">Geneen</persName> told
                                <persName corresp="#p_MJ_1">McCone</persName> that he had heard of
                            an Agency plan for a military revolt and economic chaos. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> said there was no talk of this
                            with <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss>, and that anyway matter lay
                            without the scope of the inquiry.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the 9 October Merriam to <persName corresp="#p_MJ_1"
                                >McCone</persName> memorandum, the Committee again came back to the
                            question of whether <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> had talked to
                                <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> about General Motors and Ford.
                            One of the <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> memos noted that
                            according to “our man”, <gloss target="#t_GM_1">GM</gloss> and Ford had
                            not responded. <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> again said
                            that <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> had not contacted General
                            Motors or Ford and he said that he did not recall talking about these
                            two concerns to <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> representatives. On
                            the other hand, he might well have discussed the question of applying
                            economic pressure. The Committee Staff apparently noted that it had been
                            told by General Motors and Ford that they had no record of any such
                            talks with the <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss>. It was therefore
                            curious about this entry in the <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss>
                            memorandum.</p>
                        <p>Did <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> apply any pressures or threats
                            to US companies attempting to influence their activities in or regarding
                            Chile? No.</p>
                        <p>On the question of what he might have said about President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>’s attitude, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> said that he knew the President
                            was very con<pb n="677" facs="0717" xml:id="pg_677"/>cerned in the
                            problem but that he had no information on <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                >Nixon</persName>’s attitude whatever.</p>
                        <p>Did <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> know anything to confirm
                            the statement that the President was taking a “hard line” on the Chilean
                            matter? No, <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> had no
                            information on President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>’s
                            attitude.</p>
                        <p>The Committee next turned to the <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss>
                            memorandum recording a telephoned statement by Hendrix from San Juan.
                            The Committee asked about the statement in this memorandum to the effect
                            that <persName corresp="#p_VMR_1">Viaux</persName> had received an order
                            from Washington, D.C. to “stand down”. Was this matter discussed between
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ITT_1"
                                >ITT</gloss> ? No. <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> went
                            on to say that the Agency could not comment, within the terms of the
                            inquiry, on whether or not there had in fact been such a message.</p>
                        <p>Did <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> know what sources Hendrix and
                            Berellex used? This, responded <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1"
                                >Broe</persName>, was a question that more properly should be put to
                            Berellex and Hendrix.</p>
                        <p>Did Berellex have Hendrix talk to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                            representatives in Santiago? <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1"
                                >Broe</persName> said that Berellex and Hendrix had a wide range of
                            acquaintances and that the Chief of Station in Santiago was one of among
                            many in the Embassy with which these two had had contact. If there was,
                            however, he had no reason to assume that they knew, when they talked to
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> representatives in Santiago,
                            that they were in fact doing so.</p>
                        <p>Was the “green light” allegedly received by <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName> discussed by <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1"
                                >Broe</persName> with <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> ? No it
                            was not discussed and, again within the terms of the inquiry, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> could not comment about the
                            existence of any such message.</p>
                        <p>The Committee indicated its impression that Berellex and Hendrix had a
                            special relationship with <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and
                            therefore perhaps could have got word of this “green light” from the
                                <gloss target="#t_CAS_1">CAS</gloss> element at Santiago. The
                            response to this was that there was no record that any <gloss
                                target="#t_CAS_1">CAS</gloss> member had spoken to this effect to
                            either Berellex or Hendrix.</p>
                        <p>The Committee appeared to be taken with the possibility that, even if
                            there were no cable setting forth the “green light”, it had been
                            communicated by secure phone to <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName>. To this <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1"
                                >Broe</persName> said that a secure phone link had never come into
                            play on this matter.</p>
                        <p>Blum, Committee Staff, said that, although they lay without the scope of
                            the current interrogation, there were a couple of things that might be
                            embarrassing to the Agency. One had to do with the travel of three
                            Chileans to the United States of whose arrival INS had no record. One of
                            these travellers, Blum said, used Eno Hobbing’s office to make a number
                            of telephone calls to solicit funds for Alessandri. Was this not perhaps
                            done on the behalf of <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>? The
                            Committee was asked to send questions on these matters to the
                            Agency.</p>
                        <p>The other potential embarrassment centered on the report that Chase
                            Manhattan Bank had cancelled a line of credit to Chile, an act <pb
                                n="678" facs="0718" xml:id="pg_678"/>which presumptively was at
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> insistence. Chase Manhattan had
                            indicated to the Committee that it did not want to discuss the reasons
                            for the cancellation, so it was natural to conclude that <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> had been behind it. To this <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> responded that this matter too lay
                            without the scope of the inquiry. The <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss> representatives commented, in the <gloss

                            of such request.</p>
                        <p>The Committee also asked about events of 1964. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> replied only that these possibly
                            could have been mentioned to <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> but
                            only in the most general terms if at all.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWV_1">Broe</persName> informed the Committee
                            staff that the Agency had no information on <gloss target="#t_ITT_1"
                                >ITT</gloss> contacts with <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"

                                >ITT</gloss> had tried to see him, without success.</p>
                        <p>Levinson said that there had been no contradiction between <persName

                                >McCone</persName>’s statements to the Committee.</p>
                        <p>The Committee agreed to prepare a list of questions to put to <gloss

                            during this informal, off-the-record inquiry.</p>

                        <p>The attached folder contains special channel messages between Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> and the White House
                            (or <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Alex Johnson</persName> in 40 Committee
                            role) during the period September 14, 1970 to November 8, 1970. This
                            covers most of the period between <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s victory in the popular election (September 3)
                            and the Congressional run-off (October 24) and Inauguration (November
                            3). These messages have been examined for <pb n="679" facs="0719"
                                xml:id="pg_679"/>evidence of White House involvement in actions
                            which might prove embarrassing. Also included is a summary cable from
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> outlining
                            various instructions he received and messages he sent during the period
                            January 19 to September 13, 1970 (Tab A), provided in response to a
                            Presidential request on November 7 for a history of evidence leading up
                            to the “present situation in Chile”. The document focuses primarily on
                            the Ambassador’s conflicts with State which apparently he had earlier
                            discussed directly with the President. The <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName> summary (Tab A) is, therefore, slanted to the
                            problem of key concern at the time as to whether enough had been done to
                            prevent the emergence of a freely elected communist regime in Latin
                            America.</p>
                        <p>This sample of messages indicates the extent of White House involvement
                            during this period, which was primarily in a 40 Committee context.</p>
                        <p>—On March 27 Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> was
                            notified that a limited program directed against <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> had been approved by the 40
                            Committee. This included funding to foster radical party dissidence (Tab
                            A).</p>
                        <p>—On July 3, <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> was notified
                            that Phase I of his program for political action had been approved by
                            the 40 Committee. (Tab A)</p>
                        <p>—Your back channel message of September 12 expressed the President’s
                            appreciation of <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>’s
                            perceptive reporting and efforts. It asked for recommendations as to
                            courses of action. This was at a time when State was trying to hold
                                <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> down (Tab A).</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> made a lengthy
                            back-channel report to you on recommended political actions, mostly of a
                            propaganda nature designed to help <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s opponents within the constitutional framework
                            and at the same time improve the bargaining position of his opponents if
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> should win (Tab
                            B).</p>
                        <p>—On September 26, <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> reported
                            to you and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>
                            that the Minister of Defense had informed military leaders in Chile that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> had authorized him to
                            say that there would be no military assistance or any other military
                            connections with the United States if <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> won (Tab G).</p>
                        <p>—In a report to you, while you were abroad, Director <persName
                                corresp="#p_HR_1">Helms</persName> indicated that the 40 Committee
                            on September 29 accepted some of <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName>’s ideas for bringing economic pressure (Tab
                            M).</p>
                        <p>—A September 30 message from <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1"
                                >Johnson</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>
                            reported some limited steps being taken in the economic and financial
                            fields which would indicate concern about Chile’s long-term financial
                            stability. He stated that<gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss>training
                            was being suspended with 40 Committee approval (Tabs L, M).</p>
                        <p>—An October 1 message from <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1"
                                >Johnson</persName> gave <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName> authorization to inform military leaders that we
                            would suspend <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss> matériel deliv<pb
                                n="680" facs="0720" xml:id="pg_680"/>eries. Export license requests
                            by the Chilean military were also held up at that point.</p>
                        <p>—In a message to you and <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>
                            on October 1, <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> reported he
                            had informed the Defense Minister that if <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> wins, the U.S. will not be in a position to
                            provide any financial support of the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss> for any activities. <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName> spread several unsettling stories about the
                            consequences of a communist regime (Tab P).</p>
                        <p>—On October 7 the Defense Minister was informed privately by <persName
                                corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> that training and <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MAP_1"
                                >MAP</gloss> deliveries would be held in abeyance until the policies
                            of the new government were established (Tab W).</p>
                        <p>—On October 8, the Defense Minister was informed in writing that the
                            training program was being held in abeyance (Tab W).</p>
                        <p>—In an October 9 message (Tab X), <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName> referred to a message of October 7 (not in files)
                            which apparently discussed points he should make to the Chilean military
                            and also discussed the possibility of offering more <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss> as an incentive to block <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. The message to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> apparently asked his evaluation
                            of a proposal for a coup received from a group with whom <persName
                                corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> had not been involved. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> was very negative about any coup
                            attempts at that point and stated there was no longer a basis for hope
                            of the success of any action program.</p>
                        <p>—On November 6, <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> requested
                            the use of a small amount of funds to influence decisions within the
                                <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> in favor of particular <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> candidates for President (Tab AA).</p>
                        <p>In practically all of the above cases the messages were transmitted
                            through 40 Committee channels and the appropriate representatives of the
                            bureaucracy apparently participated in the decisions. It would appear
                            that the action program amounted to rather restrained and limited
                            political interference. <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>
                            took some authorized actions to try to influence the vote and had a
                            number of direct and indirect consultations with <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s opposition and the military
                            leadership. The Ambassador also had many contacts with company
                            representatives but appears to have been cautious and discreet in his
                            dealings with them. There are no references to <gloss target="#t_ITT_1"
                                >ITT</gloss>. There is, however, evidence of a certain free-wheeling
                            quality to his style of operation during this period and he obviously
                            was frustrated by State’s reluctance to take vigorous action,
                            particularly in the early stages before the popular election in early
                            September.</p>
                        <p>There are no indications that the U.S. fostered a coup attempt to
                            circumvent <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s coming to
                            power. In a cable of September 25 (Tab E), <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName> reported he had instructed his military and <gloss
                                target="#t_CAS_1">CAS</gloss> people in very strong terms not to
                            give encouragement of any kind to potential coup plotters. He reported
                            on September 28 a questionable offer of a coup by a military group in
                            return for certain financial assurances (Tab <pb n="681" facs="0721"
                                xml:id="pg_681"/>I) This obviously was not accepted. The only
                            indication of some Washington interest in evaluating a coup is in the
                            message referred to above (Tab X).</p>
                        <p>The picture drawn from these cables cannot be considered complete since
                            it is only a limited sample. It would appear that a number of <persName

                        <p>The Popular Unity (<gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>) government of
                            President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Salvador Allende</persName> and
                            CODE, the confederation of parties opposed to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>, both have legitimate grounds for
                            claiming victory in the 4 March 1973 congressional elections. The
                            percentage split of the total popular vote was 54.7% for <gloss
                                target="#t_CODE_1">CODE</gloss> as compared to 43.39% for the <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>. This can be considered a solid victory
                            in a democratic electoral system and indicates that popular support for
                            the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government has
                            decreased 6% since the last national election. (The government won
                            49.74% of the popular vote in the 4 April 1971 municipal elections.)
                            Many observers, however, had expected <gloss target="#t_CODE_1"
                                >CODE</gloss> to win a higher percentage, and for this reason the
                            election provided a psychological boost to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> which
                            won two new seats in the Senate and six new seats in the Chamber of
                            Deputies. While <gloss target="#t_CODE_1">CODE</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> continue to publish rival “victory”
                            claims, initial opposition disappointment has given way to more
                            practical efforts to profit from this electoral experience.</p>
                        <p>The four opposition parties and the private sector are believed to have
                            made effective use of the funds approved for them by the 40 Committee.
                            The opposition maintains a solid majority in a congress which the <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> can no longer accuse of representing
                                pre-<persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> popular
                            sentiment. In retrospect, the opposition’s failure to obtain a larger
                            electoral majority was not the result of any lack of energy or
                            organization. Rather, the electoral results indicate how important the
                            “class struggle” has become to Chilean low income groups which have
                            identified with the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            government. Economic problems are a burning issue for the opposition’s
                            electorate, but less so for the Chilean lower classes, including newly
                            enfranchised illiterates who are apparently convinced that <persName

                            lot.</p>

                        <p>The results of electoral contests in five districts for 25 of the

                            56.23% (1,238,692 votes); <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> 42.05%

                            that over 60% of voters countrywide cast ballots in these senate races.

                        </p>
                        <p>There was an unprecedented delay of 24 hours between the government’s
                            penultimate electoral bulletin and the final announcement of results,
                            and <gloss target="#t_CODE_1">CODE</gloss> spokesmen continue to accuse
                            the government of playing with the electoral tally to the detriment of
                                <gloss target="#t_CODE_1">CODE</gloss> candidates. A recount is now
                            in process, and the Electoral Tribunal, which has the final word, is not
                            a government rubber stamp; its members, recently drawn by lot, are two
                            Supreme Court justices, one Appellate Court judge, a <gloss
                                target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> senator and a former Conservative
                            Party deputy. The Santiago Embassy reports that some internal
                            discrepancies in the official tally are evident, but it is doubtful
                            whether a recount could make a substantive difference of more than one
                            or two percentage points in the electoral results, with no assurance
                            that <gloss target="#t_CODE_1">CODE</gloss> would benefit from all
                            readjustments.</p>

                        <p>Opposition leaders were uniformly optimistic about the probable outcome
                            of the congressional elections. This over-confidence was based mainly on
                            the opposition’s inability to detect the strongly pro-<gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> current among the 880,949 newly
                            enfranchised illiterates and 18 to 21 year olds. This new electorate was
                            17% larger than in the municipal contests in April 1971. The <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> made its most impressive gains in those
                            provinces where new registration was largest, with the most striking
                            correlations obtaining in those provinces with high illiteracy. Another
                                <pb n="685" facs="0725" xml:id="pg_685"/>factor which made the
                            election outcome hard to predict was faulty public opinion polls which
                            gave the opposition well over 60% of the popular vote. Chilean pollsters
                            had a poor record for accuracy prior to 1973, but political tension and
                            polarization during the pre-election period compounded previous
                            shortcomings.</p>
                        <p>Despite the lack of reliable statistical data from polls and the question
                            mark presented by an enlarged electorate, opposition leaders felt that
                            the <gloss target="#t_CODE_1">CODE</gloss> parties had campaigned well.
                            They were satisfied that opposition propaganda was sufficiently
                            intensive to get CODE’s message to the people and believed that basic
                            economic problems would cause a massive rejection of <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> policies. Because of these excessively
                            high expectations, the opposition’s actual margin of victory (11% of the
                            popular vote) was disappointing, so that the elections are regarded by
                            most Chileans as a government victory.</p>
                        <p>In retrospect, most Chilean observers feel that the economic issues,
                            which were the main opposition theme, proved to be of secondary
                            importance to lower income groups who apparently voted along class
                            lines. <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> propaganda was directed almost
                            entirely toward the lower classes and highlighted the class struggle, a
                            tactic which produced the results desired by the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Of the opposition parties, the two small radical groups were the most
                            dismayed by the election results; <persName corresp="#p_BL_1">Luis
                                Bossay</persName>, president of the <gloss target="#t_PIR_1"
                                >PIR</gloss>, had some difficulty in persuading his party not to
                            disband and pull out of <gloss target="#t_CODE_1">CODE</gloss> in the
                            immediate aftermath of the elections. It now appears that the <gloss

                                >PIR</gloss> will regroup and will remain in the opposition. The
                            private sector is still in a state of shock over the unexpectedly high
                            vote obtained by the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>, which they feel
                            may presage a fatal threat to the private enterprise system in
                            Chile.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PN_1"
                                >PN</gloss> feel that they did reasonably well, but both parties
                            think that the <gloss target="#t_CODE_1">CODE</gloss> alliance cost them
                            votes at the polls even though it was strategically necessary to take
                            advantage of the bonus which Chile’s electoral law gives to a large
                            coalition. (If the <gloss target="#t_CODE_1">CODE</gloss> parties had
                            run separately and received the same number of votes, the <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> would have won the senate races 13–12
                            and would have picked up six more deputy seats.) In effect, the
                            political balance of power has not been changed to any appreciable
                            degree by the elections.</p>

                            smaller ones. This fact, noted in the 26 October 1972 request for
                            financial support, was well-known before the election, but the extent of
                            this erosion was not clear.</p>

                            mini-parties, which also fared badly) can continue to exist as viable
                            political entities. Both opposition radical factions believe that they
                            conducted a strong campaign and that their defeat was the result of a
                            voter swing toward the stronger parties in an increasingly polarized

                        <p>SUMMARY: Elements of the Chilean Air Force have prepared the rudiments of
                            a tactical plan to overthrow the present Chilean government. The plan
                            envisions the seizure of the presidential palace by Air Force troops,
                            supported by helicopters and an Army armored battalion. A number of
                            Chilean Army generals, primarily without troop commands or distant from
                            Santiago, purportedly support a plotting cabal. One of the Army
                            generals, the Commander of the Army Troops Command, has gained the
                            support of three key Army commanders in the Santiago area for the plot,
                            but the commanders of three other important regimental-sized units
                            remain at best uncommitted. The Navy in Valparaiso and several Air Force
                            unit commanders also support the effort. The cabal has also prepared a
                            list of military officers who pose potential threats to the
                            implementation of its plans. END SUMMARY.</p>

                                    The advantages revolved around preventing Chile from becoming

                                    that would occur if the U.S. assistance to the opposition in

                        <p>The meeting was devoted to Chile.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] opened with a brief review
                            of the assistance we had given the Chilean opposition parties since
                            January 1971. In concluding this review he stated his own opinion that,
                            if the opposition were able to survive through this year in reasonably
                            good condition, we probably would see an end to serious talk in Chile
                            about the desirability of a coup. He observed that by that time we would
                            be entering the final phase of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s regime and headed toward new general
                            elections. The imminence of these would, he felt, make a coup effort
                            seem a useless risk to those who might otherwise undertake one,
                            especially in the military.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJH_1">Crimmins</persName> pointed out that
                            general elections would not come until September 1976. Municipal
                            elections were scheduled for April 1975.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJH_1">Crimmins</persName> reviewed for Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName> the rationale that
                            lay behind our support to the opposition. He said that it had been
                            viewed as an effort to keep the opposition alive, to keep the current
                            political set in Chile from becoming irreversible. The basic argument
                            for the financing stemmed from moves against the private sector made by
                            the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>, its growing control of the
                            economic levers of the country, including especially the credit
                            machinery. Through these steps the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>
                            was severely limiting the capabilities of the opposition parties to
                            survive and to act as a genuine opposition. Our support had been
                            maintained to provide <pb n="691" facs="0731" xml:id="pg_691"/>the
                            sinews that would permit the survival of a viable opposition. This was
                            still the case. The central question, to his mind was: Can we afford not
                            to continue our subsidy to the opposition?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJH_1">Crimmins</persName> noted that a
                            sub-question was: What about the opposition parties—given the restraints
                            imposed upon them, were they capable of keeping themselves alive through
                            their own resources? These two questions he felt, comprised the heart of
                            the matter.</p>
                        <p>There were other questions, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJH_1"
                                >Crimmins</persName> said. One had to do with the assistance that we
                            had extended to the private sector. Noting that Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DN_1">Davis</persName> (in his own view quite rightly)
                            was nervous over the current proposal to continue assistance to this
                            quarter, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJH_1">Crimmins</persName> said that
                            this was a sensitive issue because private Chilean groups had tended to
                            be active and interested in the possibility of a coup and certain
                            segments had been dealing with military elements along these lines. We
                            had thus been concerned that the help we gave them for the 1973
                            Congressional elections could have been interpreted by these groups as a
                            signal of our own interest in a coup. We have not had any interest
                            whatever in such a development; nonetheless, <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> connection with these groups, were it to become known,
                            would mean that we could plausibly be accused of working to overthrow
                            the Government—whereas our real purpose had been to keep the Chilean
                            constitutional system alive.</p>
                        <p>All this, however, was a sub-issue; the principal question remained: Do
                            we want to continue to supply the means to keep the opposition
                            alive?</p>
                        <p>Another important factor was the increased sensitivities in the US and in
                            Chile to covert activities of this kind. This sensitivity could well
                            raise the risk level of the enterprise. There was also involved a
                            philosophical issue: i.e., do we want to continue to involve ourselves
                            in this kind of business, especially in view of the domestic atmosphere
                            in the US and the alertness of the Chilean Government to the possibility
                            that we were engaged in activities of this sort? Thus far we had been
                            fortunate, for the Chilean Government had not discovered any of the
                            activities that we in fact had been engaged in.</p>

                            were few witting people in Chile: [<hi rend="italic">2½ lines not

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJH_1">Crimmins</persName> noted that when he
                            spoke about the atmosphere here and in Chile, he had in mind
                            particularly the Church hearings and the leaks there have been about our
                            massive assistance to the <gloss target="#t_PDC_1">PDC</gloss> during
                            the 1964 elections.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJH_1">Crimmins</persName> said that his
                            judgment would be that we should continue our assistance, since the
                            parties making up the political opposition could not survive without
                            it.</p>
                        <pb n="692" facs="0732" xml:id="pg_692"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fisher</persName> agreed with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJH_1">Crimmins</persName>’ assessment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJH_1">Crimmins</persName> said that we must
                            however admit that there were now more vulnerabilities affecting our
                            assistance than there had been, especially in the US and Chile. It was
                            necessary that we be clear about the risk we are taking.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (7 lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName> said he wished to
                            make some observations. The first was that this was the first occasion
                            on which he had been called upon to consider from a position of
                            authority a matter such as this. He had been aware peripherally that
                            such activities had existed but never before had he actually been called
                            upon to take a position for or against. He said that his presumption in
                            such circumstances would be that this kind of covert financing should
                            not be undertaken unless genuine, critical interests of the US were
                            involved and were in such serious peril as to be almost in the last
                            extremity. He felt this way for a number of reasons. One was that the
                            risk and potential cost of operations such as this were very great;
                            there needed to be very weighty considerations to balance the dangers
                            involved. Another was that the practical effect of many of the
                            activities that the US undertook as a government abroad were not as
                            influential and effective as we may have assumed they would be in
                            affecting the course of events in a given environment. We tend to
                            exaggerate our weight. A third was that there might well be better ways
                            to accomplish the objectives we sought than through covert action. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName> said that therefore
                            his approach would almost invariably be against proposals or activities
                            such as the one under current review. It would require in any given case
                            a very persuasive set of reasons to cause him to think otherwise.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName> said that we needed
                            to assess very carefully the potential path that Chile might follow were
                            we not to extend the proposed assistance: what actions it could take and
                            what the impact of these would be upon US interests—if, for example,
                            Chile became another Cuba. Would this kind of program in fact help to
                            avert such an outcome?</p>
                        <p>His inclination therefore was to let the program come to an end, and not
                            to recommend its continuation. He however recognized that discussion of
                            topic had necessarily been limited up to this point. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SH_2">Shlaudeman</persName> (currently <gloss
                                target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> in Santiago) would be in the
                            Department on 11 June to take over his position as Deputy Assistant
                            Secretary in <gloss target="#t_ARA_1">ARA</gloss>. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName> would be quite happy to confer
                            with him to listen to the reasons Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SH_2"
                                >Shlaudeman</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DN_1"
                                >Davis</persName> might have for continuing the program. His mind
                            was open. He wished to repeat, however, that at this moment he was
                            against continuation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJH_1">Crimmins</persName> said that the
                            question was whether without our assistance the opposition might not
                            have done much worse in the March elections.</p>
                        <pb n="693" facs="0733" xml:id="pg_693"/>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] noted that without our
                            assistance the continued domination of the elements in Chile represented
                            by the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> would be irretrievable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fisher</persName> noted that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SH_2">Shlaudeman</persName> had reported that
                            the opposition was very discouraged.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName> said that were it
                            necessary for him to make a decision at that moment it would have to be
                            negative, and he would have to recommend to Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName> that this be the State position.
                            He would, however, prefer time to think the matter over, and to confer
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SH_2">Shlaudeman</persName>.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that those present would meet with Mr. <persName

                        <p>This Estimate assesses the situation in Chile with particular emphasis on
                            the prospects for the consolidation in power of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s Marxist regime. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has already made considerable
                            gains in strengthening his minority government through revolutionary
                            economic changes that weaken his opposition and enlarge his own
                            constituency. But this strategy has led to endemic economic and
                            political turbulence which could undercut his popular support, solidify
                            his opposition, and alienate the armed forces.</p>
                        <pb n="694" facs="0734" xml:id="pg_694"/>
                        <p>Over the next two or three years there will be a series of political
                            crises and confrontations which serve as tests of strength between the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime and its
                            opposition. The final section of the Estimate outlines three possible
                            courses of development: (1) <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> could be held by his opposition to a standoff,
                            with neither side registering substantial gains, and with the political
                            future remaining very much in doubt until the 1976 presidential
                            election. (2) <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> could
                            consolidate his regime to the point where the opposition could neither
                            constrain his actions nor raise a serious electoral challenge. (3)
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s Marxist regime
                            could be repudiated either by a major reduction of his freedom of action
                            imposed by the military, or, in extreme circumstances, by his removal
                            from office via a coup.</p>
                        <p>At this juncture, a <hi rend="italic">political standoff</hi> seems the
                            most likely course of development. The chances for <hi rend="italic"
                                >consolidation</hi> or <hi rend="italic">repudiation</hi>, while
                            less likely than those for <hi rend="italic">standoff</hi>, appear
                            roughly equal, one to the other.</p>
                        <p>The US lacks powerful and reliable levers for influencing the outcome. US
                            encouragement of the forces within Chile that constrain <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s behavior could have some
                            impact on the course of events, though at best a very limited one.
                            Continuation of the present array of US economic pressures against
                            Chile, within the context of a “cool but correct” diplomatic posture,
                            can help assure that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            economic troubles—which are largely of his own making—will persist as a
                            major political liability.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s Political Position</p>
                        <p>1. President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> took office
                            in November 1970 with only 37 percent of the popular vote, yet with a
                            pledge to carry out an irreversible socialist revolution within a
                            constitutional framework. He has already registered important gains in
                            political strength during the first half of his six-year term, and he
                            wields formidable assets for effecting still further gains. His
                            liabilities are also imposing, however, and he has not yet consolidated
                            the power of his Marxist regime.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Goals and Assets</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s strategy is to use
                            his vast executive authority to effect revolutionary economic and social
                            changes—a process which strengthens his hold on power. More
                            specifically, he has forced the pace of the state takeover of the
                            economy and of redistribution of income in order to weaken his
                            opposition in the middle and upper classes and to enlarge the support
                            for his Marxist coalition among the poor.</p>
                        <p>3. Especially during his first year in office, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> worked within an environment
                            favorable to far-reaching change. The 1970 election was widely viewed in
                            Chile as a mandate to accelerate the restruc<pb n="695" facs="0735"
                                xml:id="pg_695"/>turing of the economy begun by the previous
                            administration. His swift action in confiscating US copper interests
                            added the force of nationalism to the political momentum for
                            revolutionary policies.</p>
                        <p>4. The extent of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            success so far was revealed in the March 1973 congressional election, in
                            which his Popular Unity (<gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>) coalition
                            received 43 percent of the vote. These returns indicated that the bulk
                            of low income Chileans believe that the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> regime has improved their condition, or at least
                            is working in their interest. Some among the middle income groups,
                            especially youths, also support his revolutionary goals.</p>
                        <p>5. The growth in support for the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>
                            reflects <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s skill at
                            political maneuver as well as the popularity of his measures. He has
                            held together most of the elements of his unwieldy coalition, which
                            includes hardline extremists as well as pragmatic politicians. He has
                            been exerting increasingly effective influence on the hierarchy of his
                            own obstreperous Socialist Party, though he still is challenged by an
                            influential faction which agitates for a more aggressive revolutionary
                            pace. The Communist Party, in contrast, serves him well as a disciplined
                            and moderating force within the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>.
                            Reflecting the line of their Soviet mentors, the Communists see little
                            point in risking their hard-won position <hi rend="italic">within</hi>
                            the government through unnecessary provocation of the opposition and the
                            military.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has been particularly
                            effective in dealing with the armed forces, in part because of their
                            apolitical tradition. Though generally sympathetic with the need for
                            social and economic changes, most military officers are wary of Marxism
                            and deeply concerned about the turbulence engendered by <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s rule. Yet the army chiefs,
                            because they fear that a coup could ignite large-scale popular
                            resistance, have felt they must work to avoid national disaster <hi

                            constitutionalist bent via regular praise of the military and generous

                            most evident in November 1972, when he asked three top officers to join
                            his Cabinet temporarily, to bring an end to major disorders and pave the
                            way for holding the March election in relative stability.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s hand is strengthened
                            by the divergent interests of the opposition parties, as well as by
                            their demoralization over the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>’s
                            electoral gains. The Christian Democrats (<gloss target="#t_PDC_1"
                                >PDC</gloss>), Chile’s largest party, have their own socialist
                            traditions and initially lent qualified support to <persName

                            have stiffened their opposition and joined in an uncomfortable alliance
                            with the National Party, the second largest anti-<gloss target="#t_UP_1"

                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s most obvious
                            liability is that he remains a <hi rend="italic">minority</hi> president
                            in a highly politicized society. His opponents control the Congress and
                            are influential in the judiciary. They also hold important assets in the
                            news media, the educational system, organized labor, and certain sectors
                            of the economy. The constitutionality, not to mention the efficacy, of
                            his every move comes under vociferous political attack. Thus, he can
                            advance towards his goal of restructuring the country only in fits and
                            starts and through an unprecedented extension of executive
                            authority.</p>
                        <p>10. More fundamentally, his strategy for cementing the <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>’s hold on power creates economic and
                            political tensions which could undercut the gains he has made. The
                                <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>’s reckless policies and feckless
                            management of the swollen state sector have given rise to endemic
                            economic turbulence. After an initial spurt in 1971, industrial output
                            has gone into a protracted decline, while agricultural output has fallen
                            by more than 25 percent. These shortfalls, combined with the rapid
                            expansion of the purchasing power of the poor and with near runaway
                            inflation, have made a shambles of domestic trade. Shortages of
                            essential goods, queues, black marketeering, and political manipulation
                            of the distribution system have become the order of the day. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s current policies will not
                            revive domestic production, and he will continue to be saddled with a
                            deteriorating economy.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s immediate economic
                            concern is the anticipated stringency in food and fuel supplies during
                            the winter months ahead (June–September). He is undertaking a major
                            expansion of food imports and of state controls over distribution, to
                            favor the poor. But because of the unprecedented pressure on port and
                            distribution facilities and on the bureaucracy, irregularities in
                            supplies will irritate most Chileans, including many of the poor.</p>
                        <p>12. Chile is also experiencing an erosion of respect for constituted
                            authority, as political and special interest groups increasingly resort
                            to direct and forceful action to protect and advance their interests.
                            The style was set by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            practice of stretching the law to speed the state takeover of the
                            economy. Leftist extremists—largely independent of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s influence—go one step
                            further with illegal seizures of farms, factories and stores. Rightwing
                            groups, representing dispossessed and threatened owners, counter with
                            their own disturbances, and at times clash with the militants of the
                            left.</p>
                        <pb n="697" facs="0737" xml:id="pg_697"/>
                        <p>13. The problem now extends beyond the activity of extremists and
                            reflects a polarization of society which is wearing away the Chilean
                            predilection for political compromise and abhorrence of bloodshed. The
                            major political parties have paramilitary auxiliaries and student
                            affiliates geared for militant action. Business and professional
                            associations are ready to use direct action to protect their economic
                            stake (e.g., the “bosses strike” of last October). And so are the copper
                            miners, the government workers, and other privileged labor unions who
                            fear that the regime’s efforts to aid the poor will be increasingly at
                            their expense. So far <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            has been able to contain political violence short of a major
                            blood-letting. But political disturbances have become nearly as
                            commonplace in today’s Chile as economic breakdowns.</p>

                            Relations</p>
                        <p>14. Chile’s foreign economic relations reflect both the <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>’s dismal economic performance and
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s skill at political
                            maneuver. The country is saddled with a huge and rising foreign debt and
                            a parlous credit rating. From 1970 to 1972, exports fell by nearly 25
                            percent, while imports rose by over 35 percent. (Food imports jumped
                            from $150 million to $400 million.) The <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> government sustained a $540 million trade
                            deficit in 1972 by obtaining credits from new sources, including
                            politically motivated aid from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> and others; by defaulting on debt repayments to old
                            creditors, mainly the US; and by allowing net foreign reserves to run
                            deeply into the red.<note n="2" xml:id="d136fn2">About $1 billion in
                                economic assistance was extended to Chile during 1971–1972, mostly
                                for development projects. The latter includes $400 million in
                                Communist development loans on which little has so far been drawn.
                                Among the key credits which met <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName>’s immediate import needs were (a) $100
                                million in hard currency from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                    >USSR</gloss>; (b) food shipments from Argentina, Australia, New
                                Zealand, and the People’s Republic of China; and (c) $85 million in
                                balance-of-payments support from the International Monetary Fund.
                                [Footnote is in the original.]</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>15. A similar pattern is evident so far in 1973. Thanks in large measure
                            to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s cultivation of a
                            favorable international image, the Chilean revolution is regarded with
                            sympathy by many non-Communist as well as Communist governments. Thus,
                            most West European countries have been reluctant to take a hard line on
                            Chilean repayment of old debts and a few have extended new lines of
                            credit. For certain new creditors, it is a case of good business as well
                            as good politics. Argentina, and even Brazil, have extended credits for
                            goods that they could not easily sell elsewhere (buses, tractors, and
                            such).</p>
                        <p>16. Because of a recent sharp rise in world prices, Chile stands to
                            increase its earnings from copper exports in 1973 by about $200 million.
                            This should help prevent any serious deterioration in Chile’s import
                            position, but only if old and new creditors do not toughen their terms.
                                <pb n="698" facs="0738" xml:id="pg_698"/>On balance, Chile is likely
                            to remain dependent on political favors and subject to day-to-day
                            strains in trying to maintain imports at a politically-acceptable
                            level.</p>
                        <p>17. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has petitioned the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> for massive economic
                            assistance to strengthen the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> regime
                            for the long haul. The Soviets are interested both in increasing their
                            influence in South America and in the <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                            >UP</gloss>’s success as a model for a Marxist revolution through
                            election. Yet they do not want another Cuba on their hands in terms of
                            forking out regular, extensive balance-of-payments assistance to a
                            foundering economy. Soviet caution also reflects doubts about <persName

                        <p>20. US encouragement of the forces within Chile that constrain <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s behavior could have some
                            impact on the ultimate political outcome, though at best a very limited
                            one. Continued US cooperation with and assistance to the Chilean
                            military, for example, would contribute to their willingness to stand up
                            against certain policy initiatives by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> (e.g., acceptance of sizable Soviet military
                            assistance).</p>
                        <p>21. Continuation of the present array of US economic pressures against
                            Chile, within the context of a “cool but correct” diplomatic posture,
                            can help assure that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            economic troubles—which are largely of his own making—will persist as a
                            major political liability. But if the US were to institute a policy of
                            open and all-out economic pressure, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> would gain more political strength from wrapping
                            himself in the flag than he would lose because of the additional
                            economic burden. Besides, Chile would probably attract increased aid on
                            political grounds from Communist countries, from certain European
                            countries (despite US pressures), and from sympathetic neighbors (in
                            particular, Peronist Argentina). The outcome would be the same whether
                            or not the US policy were explained on the basis of the <persName

                            generated by his policies, because he is unwilling to risk undertaking
                            the major reordering of priorities—towards austerity and
                            discipline—needed to spur economic growth and stem political

                        <p>23. There are no scheduled nation-wide popular elections to test the
                            success of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s strategy
                            until the municipal contests of 1975 and the presidential race of 1976.
                            In the meantime there will be a series of political crises and
                            confrontations—some triggered by the regime’s initiatives, some by the
                            resistance of the opposition to his right or the provocations of the
                            zealots to his left. The outcome of these tests of strength will depend
                            on the interplay of a series of complex factors: Al<pb n="700"

                        <p>24. The inevitable succession of political crises seems likely to draw
                            the military into a more open and important political role. But what
                            role? There is evidence of growing anti-<gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss> feeling and coup plotting within the armed forces, and
                            also of a growing willingness among opposition politicians to look to
                            the military for support in curbing <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s strength. Many navy and air force leaders
                            apparently already feel that strong measures against <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> are urgently required. The
                            picture in the army, by far the key service, is less clear. A few
                            generals and a substantial number of middle grade officers also appear
                            anxious to constrain <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            hand. But in part because of fear of touching off a civil war, the top
                            leadership, especially Commander-in-Chief <persName corresp="#p_PGC_1"
                                >Prats</persName>, continues to weigh in against a coup.</p>
                        <p>25. A successful coup would probably require extensive high-level support
                            in all three services, and at least tacit approval by the <hi
                                rend="italic">Carabineros</hi>, the national police. The necessary
                            support might be quickly forthcoming in the event of very widespread
                            disorders or such a complete economic collapse as to imperil the
                            security of the country. Short of these contingencies, broad military
                            support seems unlikely unless there is (a) a major decline in <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s popular appeal, (b) a broad
                            commitment to a coup by the political opposition, and (c) an
                            intransigent posture by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            in the face of demands from the military. On balance, there would seem
                            to be only an outside chance of a successful military move to force
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> from office at this
                            juncture.</p>
                        <p>26. Much more likely would be the return of military leaders to the
                            Cabinet, under terms negotiated with <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>. Such an arrangement would, in effect,
                            strengthen rather than weaken <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s hold on office, at least initially. But the
                            military would probably attempt to curb certain <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss> policies which they believe are exacerbating tensions,
                            and to crack down against extremists on both the left and right. The
                            subsequent dynamics could work either for or against <persName

                        <p>27. The following paragraphs outline three possible lines of development
                            in Chile over the next two or three years: a political standoff;
                            consolidation of the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>; repudiation of
                            the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>. At this juncture, a <hi
                                rend="italic">standoff</hi>, in which neither <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> nor the opposition registers
                            substantial gains in political strength, seems the most likely course of
                            development. The chances for <hi rend="italic">consolidation</hi> or <hi
                                rend="italic">repudiation</hi>, while less likely than those for <hi

                            other.</p>
                        <p>28. <hi rend="italic">Standoff: Neither Side Registers Substantial

                            <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would experience further
                            gains in some aspects of his political position but <pb n="701"
                                facs="0741" xml:id="pg_701"/>perhaps reverses in other aspects. The
                            net effect would be no major shift in the present balance of political
                            power. Through skillful maneuver he would weaken the opposition somewhat
                            further. Yet the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>’s popularity would
                            still be hindered by the economic and political turbulence. Though he
                            might call upon the military to shore up his regime during rough
                            periods, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would remain
                            sufficiently independent to continue along his established policy
                            direction. For their part, the military would be able to set some limits
                            on <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s political
                            initiatives. The opposition too would be able to place constraints on
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s freedom of action
                            and to criticize his regime vigorously.</p>
                        <p>29. Under these conditions, the rules of the political game would not be
                            changed basically and the way would still be open to a competitive
                            presidential contest in 1976. Without the charismatic <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, who would not be eligible to
                            run, the Marxist parties would face difficulties in maintaining the
                            unity of their coalition. The opposition would face similar problems of
                            maintaining unity, since the platform of any Christian Democratic
                            candidate, while emphasizing promised improvements in the quality of
                            government, would probably accept a significant number of the socialist
                            measures already in effect. Thus, the political future of Chile would
                            remain very much in doubt at least until the electoral lineup for 1976
                            became clear.</p>

                            political initiatives or to offer a serious electoral challenge. This
                            development would probably require, in addition to strong initiatives by

                            demoralization or discrediting of the opposition through major blunders
                            on its part (e.g., counterproductive violence or a failed coup). The
                            military would lend at least tacit approval to a more authoritarian
                            government. The regime would still face debilitating economic problems,
                            internal political disputes, and various manifestations of popular

                            <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would either suffer a

                            in the areas of economic policy and public order, or, in extreme
                            circumstances, be removed from office via a coup. This case would
                            probably require that the public get fed up with mounting inconvenience
                            and disruption and that the opposition be able to pin the blame for
                            Chile’s difficulties squarely on <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s mismanagement. Also, <persName

                            (especially his ability to use the military towards his own ends) would
                            have to be reduced—for instance, by ten<pb n="702" facs="0742"
                                xml:id="pg_702"/>sions within the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>
                            created by the revolutionary zealots. The military might well insist

                            But the outcome would depend principally on the relative popular appeal
                            of the candidates and how—in a new situation—the political forces were
                            arrayed.</p>

                            <item>Paris Club Meeting on Chile’s Debt</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The Paris Club of creditor governments will meet later this week with
                            Chile to consider the latter’s request for debt relief for 1973 and
                            1974. The last major meeting of the group (in April 1972) afforded Chile
                            short-term relief but also required Chile to recognize all valid debts,
                            including copper debts. Since then, Chile has offered to submit the
                            copper dispute to fact-finding procedures under the 1914 U.S.–Chile
                            Treaty. Our counter-offer was to make these debts subject to binding
                            arbitration. Chile has not yet responded.</p>
                        <p>At the coming meeting, our position is to delay a decision on Chile’s
                            request regarding the 1973–74 debts until later this year. Our argument
                            is that Chile (1) has not fulfilled its commitments under the April 1972
                            agreement, and (2) does not have an effective stabilization <pb n="703"
                                facs="0743" xml:id="pg_703"/>program to offer creditors in exchange
                            for debt relief. The reason for the delay is the fact that other
                            creditors are inclined to be liberal with Chile and a delay will prevent
                            any action that might be interpreted by Chile’s government as
                            international understanding or support at this critical juncture.</p>
                        <p>If we cannot persuade the other creditors to go along with delay, we have
                            three options:</p>
                        <p>(1) to agree to sign a rescheduling agreement for 1973–74 without
                            effective economic commitments by Chile;</p>
                        <p>(2) to refuse to take part in another Paris Club agreement; or</p>
                        <p>(3) to accept a compromise under which Chile would make a down payment on
                            debts but the Paris Club would not enter into a formal rescheduling
                            agreement. We would meet with Chile later in the year to consider a
                            formal rescheduling agreement in light of economic developments in Chile
                            in the interim.</p>
                        <p>Option 1 is unacceptable because it would give <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> an unearned political gain,
                            allowing him to announce further debt relief with no effort on Chile’s
                            part. Option 2 would put the U.S. in an isolated position and allow
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to focus blame on us
                            for his economic woes. Option 3 is an acceptable compromise which would
                            give the other creditors what they want (at least a token payment)
                            without giving Chile a full rescheduling agreement.</p>
                        <p>If you approve, State and Treasury will proceed along this line. We must
                            face the fact, however, that if all the other creditors decide to enter
                            into a rescheduling agreement—and we are working to convince them
                            otherwise—we may still face the prospect of being isolated. But I do not
                            think we can go along with any rescheduling arrangement with Chile at
                            this point, first because of the implications for “soft” rescheduling
                            agreements worldwide, and, also, because of Chile’s failure: (1) to
                            fulfill its economic commitments under the 1972 agreement; (2) to
                            fulfill its obligations regarding compensation for nationalized
                            properties; and (3) to make any commitments regarding economic
                            performance as a justification for debt rescheduling of 1973 debts.

                            and private sector organizations opposed to the Popular Unity (<gloss

                            from 1 July 1973 through 30 June 1974. Funds previously approved by the

                            Confederation—CODE) to campaign during the period preceding the 4 March
                            1973 congressional elections provided for subsidy payments to each party
                            for the months of March and April 1973 while the outcome of the election
                            was being assessed. These funds have been adequate to enable the parties
                            to maintain their organizations intact through June 1973.</p>
                        <p>Support requested for the four opposition parties for the period

                        <p>The requested financial support is considered to be realistic in terms of

                            the congressional elections provided a psychological boost to <persName

                            programs. The abortive military coup attempt of 29 June 1973
                            strengthened <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> still
                            further. Many Chileans believe that the next six months to a year will

                            irreversibly established.</p>

                        <p>The congressional elections of 4 March 1973 demonstrated that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> has considerable support among low
                            income groups and among those who voted for the first time under the
                            recently-relaxed voting standards (primarily illiterates). These groups
                            supported the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> despite rampant
                            inflation and acute shortages of consumer items primarily because
                            political polarization has produced an acute class consciousness which
                            has led the Chilean poor to identify with the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime. As a result of this
                            support from the lower classes, the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss>
                            has already begun to push forward on various socialization fronts with
                            renewed confidence and at an accelerated pace. The <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> can be expected to remain flexible,
                            advancing its program as rapidly as possible but retaining the
                            capability to retreat and compromise when necessary. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s ability to manipulate the
                            Armed Forces, control his Communist and Socialist supporters, and to
                            deal with the civilian opposition was recently strengthened by the small
                            abortive military uprising of 29 June 1973.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> parties are now beginning to think
                            more and more in terms of the 1976 elections, since they now believe

                            prevent the irrevocable imposition of Marxism, and they have been
                            seeking some means to support or bring about such intervention. (Their
                            hopes have been diminished by the ill-planned and uncoordinated coup

                        <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                        <p>The abortive military revolt on 29 June capped a period of sharply rising
                            political tensions. Its repercussions have further strained the fabric
                            of Chilean society and threaten to overwhelm what is left of the
                            military and civilian commitment to constitutionality and democratic
                            processes after almost three years of political polarization.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> appears to be
                            trying to defuse the situation, but his own supporters are proving
                            nearly as troublesome as his opponents. At the same time, increasing
                            numbers of military officers are coming to believe that, if the armed
                            forces cannot correct what is wrong with Chile by forcing <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to find a political solution,
                            they may have to take matters into their own hands.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">This memorandum discusses the dynamics of the current
                                situation, suggests several possible outcomes, and examines some

                        </p>
                        <p>It looked, last March, like a promising year for <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. His Popular Unity coalition
                            came through with 43 percent of the vote in nationwide congressional
                            elections. The six-percent increase in the coalition’s total over the
                            1970 presidential returns was a psychological victory for <pb n="710"
                                facs="0750" xml:id="pg_710"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, and he appeared eager
                            to press ahead with his plans for “building socialism.”</p>
                        <p>After the election, however, new socialist initiatives prompted the
                            opposition Christian Democratic and National parties to harden their
                            positions. They began to challenge the government with increasing
                            frequency and severity.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, a significant realignment was taking place within
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s governing
                            coalition that was to have an almost immediate effect on his ability to
                            maneuver. The Communist Party, reevaluating its strategy of caution and
                            compromise, decided that it was futile to seek a dialogue with the
                            Christian Democrats when the opposition was seeking to bring down the
                            government. The Communists concluded that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s failure to deal firmly with the opposition was
                            damaging the coalition, and they joined the Socialists in pushing for a
                            tougher stand. This shift eroded <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s ability to play off one party against the
                            other for his own ends.</p>
                        <p>Political tensions rose sharply during May and June as a prolonged strike
                            by copper workers put further strains on Chile’s battered economy. As
                            supporters and opponents of the government tested their strength in the
                            streets of the capital, <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            tried to ease tensions by coaxing the military back into the cabinet.
                            But he could not come up with a formula that would meet the military’s
                            stiff preconditions and yet be acceptable to <gloss target="#t_UP_1"
                                >UP</gloss> leaders.</p>
                        <p>The last week in June was a watershed. On 29 June, a group of relatively
                            low-level coup plotters in an armored battalion launched an attack on
                            the presidential palace. The uprising was put down less than three hours
                            after it began by loyal forces under the direct command of Army
                            Commander <persName corresp="#p_PGC_1">Prats</persName> and other
                            pro-government generals.</p>
                        <p>The abortive revolt was a wild gamble on the part of a small group of
                            plotters who hoped other units would join the rebellion once the
                            shooting started. Ironically, the military as a whole may have emerged
                            with its image of defender of constitutional order enhanced.</p>
                        <p>Initially it appeared that the government’s success in putting down the
                            revolt might be just the boost <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> needed to manipulate the military back into the
                            cabinet, strengthen his hand vis-à-vis the Socialists and Communists,
                            and deal decisively with the opposition.</p>
                        <p>The military, however, refused to budge from its insistence that it will
                            return to the cabinet only if given the power to make policy changes.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> was forced to name a
                            new cabinet made up of civilians. The Socialists, Communists, and
                            extreme leftist groups began pressing <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> to take over the factories their workers
                            occupied on the day of the abortive revolt. In addition, they started to
                            distribute weapons to their followers in preparation for what they
                            apparently see as inevitable conflict with the military and the
                            opposition parties. The <pb n="711" facs="0751" xml:id="pg_711"/>illegal
                            arms issue in turn has rallied the opposition back to the attack, with
                            some rightwing groups hoping that nationwide strikes and terrorist
                            action will provoke the military into taking over the government.</p>
                        <p>This trend of events has left the armed forces more troubled than ever.
                            The military have been concerned over the regime’s manifest intent to
                            impose Marxist teachings in the schools, the existence of paramilitary
                            forces, and the occupation of factories. They are particularly disturbed
                            over the stepped-up arming of the government’s civilian supporters and
                            by attempts to subvert military discipline. Serious coup plotting,
                            dating from well before the maverick attempt of 29 June, continues among
                            certain officers in the three services. The plotters’ main problem—still
                            unsolved—has been to ensure the cooperation of key army units in
                            Santiago. The feeling that something must be done to relieve the
                            nation’s problems seems to be spreading, especially in the navy and air
                            force where ranking officers reportedly are under intense pressure from
                            their juniors to act.</p>
                        <p>While there is increasingly open coup talk in navy and air force circles,
                            there is also recognition of the need for army support. Army Commander
                                <persName corresp="#p_PGC_1">Prats</persName> remains the prime
                            obstacle. He is so strongly opposed to a coup that he reportedly has
                            told troops to disobey their commanders if they are ordered to
                            participate in any move against the government. None of the plotters
                            appears to have a viable scheme for getting around <persName
                                corresp="#p_PGC_1">Prats</persName>, but the present level of
                            tension is such that another desperation move, possibly directed against
                                <persName corresp="#p_PGC_1">Prats</persName> as well as the
                            government, is a continuing possibility.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A Look Ahead</p>
                        <p>The course of events over the next few months may take a new turn, or—in
                            typically Chilean fashion—the crisis may simply continue. A protracted
                            period of political unrest is a distinct possibility; even deterioration
                            into civil war cannot be ruled out. Some break in the crisis seems more
                            likely, however. This could come in several ways, ranging from a
                            political “solution” relieving tensions but solving nothing, to a
                            military takeover bringing fundamental changes.</p>

                            guarantee that presidential elections, which the party is confident of
                            winning, would be held as scheduled in 1976.</p>
                        <p>The National Party probably would support the arrangement, or at least
                            not oppose it.</p>
                        <p>The Popular Unity parties would be infuriated, but they probably would
                            defer action until it was clear what kind of policies the military
                            planned to follow. It is more likely than not, however, that eventually
                            the Socialists and Communists would turn to violent opposition.</p>
                        <p>Leftist extremist groups such as the Movement of the Revolutionary Left
                            would militantly oppose such an arrangement from the beginning.</p>

                            be willing to take on the armed forces despite the military’s superior
                            firepower.</p>
                        <p>The outcome of such a confrontation is uncertain—neither side is prepared
                            for a prolonged struggle. Assuming that the armed forces prevailed,
                            there would still be strikes, demonstrations, and other forms of
                            protest. Repressive measures would be necessary.</p>
                        <p>The Christian Democrats would support an all-military government only so
                            long as elections were guaranteed. If the military showed signs of
                            wanting to stay in power beyond 1976, Christian Democratic support would
                            evaporate.</p>
                        <p>The conservative National Party’s support for an all-military government
                            would be less conditional.</p>

                            </hi>. Indeed, a military government could even be instrumental in

                        <p>Socialism in Chile is based on widely held political beliefs and
                            supported by a large part of the electorate. Many Christian Democratic
                                <pb n="714" facs="0754" xml:id="pg_714"/>programs are socialist in
                            nature. The majority of military officers probably want to continue
                            programs that are welfare-oriented and designed to distribute the
                            nation’s wealth more evenly. While the military does not favor the
                            wholesale elimination of small- and medium-sized private industries, it
                            has little quarrel with government takeover of basic industries.</p>

                            government simply are irreversible at this point. The most obvious of
                            these is the expropriation of the US copper interests, which was
                            approved by practically all political sectors and is regarded as an
                            expression of national sovereignty. Another is the illegal takeover of
                            farms, either by peasants or government agencies. The military knows
                            that further seizures and expropriations must be stopped if farm
                            production is to be increased, but a concerted attempt to remove those
                            already occupying lands would be unlikely.</p>

                            supporters of the previous regime might have to be prolonged
                            indefinitely, and it could escalate into a wide-ranging civil war. This
                            danger would be enhanced under a new government headed by lower-level

                            financial, from various foreign sources would be severely curtailed. In
                            addition, <hi rend="italic">the US would be expected to undertake a

                            stability. The Christian Democratic and National parties would not be
                            likely to back the military if it appeared that their own interests were
                            to suffer. Political support might well be conditioned on a military

                            promise the military might be unwilling to make. Some of these

                            pro- and anti-<persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> forces.
                            The nation’s political life is characterized by inflamed rhetoric, ever
                            increasing civil violence and unchecked economic deterioration. The
                            October 1972 middle-class strike which was triggered by truckers and
                            paralyzed the nation for over a month is now being repeated by another
                            truckers strike with widespread support from middle-class labor guilds,
                            shop keepers and professional men.</p>
                        <p>The nation’s armed forces, traditionally remaining outside the political
                            arena, have been increasingly drawn to the center of the political
                            struggle. Although their constitutional persuasions are deeply rooted,
                            the Chilean military are under extreme pressure by the contending
                            political forces to either support the government in all its actions or
                            to intervene against it in one form or another. Plotting by disaffected
                            officers and rumors of impending coups are commonplace. Less common, but
                            no less symptomatic of the tensions within the armed forces were the
                            abortive attack of June 29 against the Presidential palace by elements
                            of a disaffected tank regiment and the more recent confused efforts by
                            some Chilean air force officers to openly defy President <persName

                            <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> is himself in part
                            responsible for pulling the armed forces closer to the political arena
                            by seeking on two occasions, in November 1972 and in August 1973, to
                            strengthen the government through the inclusion of high-ranking military
                            officers in his cabinet. This maneuver <pb n="716" facs="0756"
                                xml:id="pg_716"/>succeeded in its purpose in 1972 but obviously
                            failed in the current situation. The resignation on August 23 of Army
                                <gloss target="#t_CINC_1">CINC</gloss> and Defense Minister General
                                <persName corresp="#p_PGC_1">Prats</persName> removes from the armed
                            forces the most effective opponent to coup-minded military plotters.
                            Having lost the confidence of most of the senior officers under his
                            command and other ranks for his apparent determination to defend the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime, <persName

                            when requested to do so by a majority of his generals. This development
                            in the odyssey of the Chilean military would appear at this writing to
                            ease the way for intervention-minded officers in the Army to cooperate
                            more actively with their coup-prone colleagues in the Navy and Air

                        <p>This paper is limited to a review of only those more likely contingency
                            situations involving a change in government or a major change in the
                            present government’s policies and which could require an overall review
                            of U.S. policy toward Chile. The Ad Hoc Working Group recognizes that
                            such a chain of events may be set into motion by deteriorating
                            conditions or the actions of other power groups rather than by the
                            military itself. However, no such change could be effected without
                            active military support.</p>
                        <p>Possible military intervention could: (A) force <persName

                            “violations” and hold new elections; (C) carry out an outright coup
                            without reference to early elections; or (D) attempt to oust the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> Government but
                            founder on divisions within its own ranks. These contingencies are
                            separately reviewed below.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Contingencies:</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Acting in unison, the Chilean military, including the Carabineros
                            (National Police), could seek a compromise solution to the escalating
                            confrontations between government and opposition forces by forcing
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to moderate his
                            policies specifically with respect to the economic survival of
                            opposition media outlets, further government encroachments on the
                            private sector, and the disarming of civilian partisans of the
                            Government. The explicit or implied threat of more drastic military
                            action might induce <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to
                            accede (possible leftist reaction is discussed below). An adjustment of
                            economic policies to reduce consumer frustrations might also be
                            contemplated.</p>
                        <p>This option for the Chilean military would have the attraction of staying
                            within constitutional bounds. It could incorporate several variations.
                            The most likely would be military insistence upon a determining voice in
                            national policy, unlike the experience between November 1972 and March
                            1973 when military authority in ministries headed by armed forces
                            designees often proved transitory or superfi<pb n="717" facs="0757"
                                xml:id="pg_717"/>cial. The military might eventually demand more
                            strategic Ministries than they head now, as well as military staffing of
                            key sub-cabinet and secondary posts. Another possible demand would be
                            that the opposition parties be invited to participate in a Government of
                            national reconciliation. This is a more remote possibility, if only
                            because the opposition would hesitate to share the burden of resolving
                            Chile’s critical economic problems. It is more likely that military
                            pressure would be exerted to give the cabinet a more technical cast than
                            it has now.</p>
                        <p>This contingency would leave <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> in office and would not resolve our bilateral
                            problems. The military might well press initially for a resolution of
                            U.S.-Chilean differences out of a desire to resuscitate the Chilean
                            economy but would soon find itself up against political constraints
                            arguing against concessions of substance to the United States.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>If the temper of popular discontent becomes sufficiently intense, coupled
                            with some excess by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, a
                            united military could force his withdrawal from the presidency and
                            invoke the legal provisions for holding new elections. Although
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> can be expected to
                            exercise great care in this regard, the military could cite some
                            constitutional “violation” to justify its actions, or could find subtler
                            means to carry out its intent. While <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> is unlikely to volunteer his withdrawal and
                            would strongly resist any public charges of unconstitutional action, it
                            is remotely conceivable that he might prefer a gracious exit on the
                            pretext of ailing health to an unceremonious ouster.</p>
                        <p>While contingencies B and C both involve military interventions, the key
                            element in contingency B is the military’s declared intention promptly
                            to restore constitutional government. It would serve to demonstrate that
                            the military did not act out of selfish motives to usurp power. Possible
                            elements of this contingency might be the designation of a military
                            officer as Interior Minister who would then succeed <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> as Acting President during the
                            interval (a total of 70 days) before elections are held. Cabinet changes
                            to install noncontroversial or technically qualified persons in key
                            positions in the interim also might be incorporated. This contingency
                            assumes the Chilean military have no real desire to emulate their
                            Peruvian counterparts.</p>
                        <p>A military government of this sort, because of its caretaker nature,
                            probably would not be in a position to alter materially the course of
                            our bilateral problems.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>There is no indication of any widespread sense of “mission” among the
                            Chilean military to take over and run the country. However, in a chaotic
                            situation, it is conceivable that the influence of some mili<pb n="718"
                                facs="0758" xml:id="pg_718"/>tary men might cause an intervention in
                            the form of an outright coup, holding power until the next scheduled
                            Presidential elections in 1976, or for an indefinite period with little
                            pretense of holding elections or returning to constitutional norms
                            within a predictable time frame.</p>
                        <p>Depending on the circumstances, some private sector and political groups
                            probably would welcome military rule, for a time at least, while the
                            most difficult problems of economic adjustment and possible extreme
                            leftist terrorism are being faced rather than assume that responsibility
                            directly. However, as the period of military rule were extended, the
                            normal reaction of the political parties, and particularly the <gloss

                            constitutional government would be manifested.</p>
                        <p>The general lack of preparedness of the Chilean military to run a
                            government, particularly one enmeshed in critical economic difficulties,
                            would also argue against this contingency. Furthermore, the Chilean
                            military are all too well aware of the political pitfalls which they
                            would face. However, an abnormal electoral climate accompanying
                            political turmoil might induce the military to think in longer-range
                            terms.</p>
                        <p>D. <hi rend="italic">Divided Military</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The divisions within and between Chilean military services, the absence
                            to date of a charismatic military figure who could unite all the Armed
                            Forces and the possible effective infiltration of the military by the
                                <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> could lead to a situation where
                            some elements of the military might seek to carry out one of the above
                            contingencies and encounter significant resistance from within the Armed
                            Forces. This contingency would tend to escalate rather than lessen the
                            level of public disorder and violence. This would be particularly true
                            if the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> parties engaged in the same
                            type of demonstrations and strike action now being employed by the
                            government’s opponents. The resulting uncertain situation with rival
                            military factions supported by civilian elements could degenerate into a
                            chaotic situation and possibly civil war.</p>
                        <p>We consider a full-blown civil war improbable, but military divisiveness
                            or partial indecision could increase the chances of sustained civil
                            violence cum insurgency. This contingency could appear in a variety of
                            forms ranging from the revolt of a single unit, as in the ill-conceived
                            June 29 rising where plotters in one unit acted without coordinating
                            with any one else, to a revolt led by junior officers in one or more
                            services, without the blessing of superiors. Coordination among the
                            three services and the Carabineros on what to do about the course of
                            events under <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> has been
                            imperfect, but the likelihood of an entire service acting without the
                            knowledge and at least the tacit approval of the others is very low.
                            Sentiment in the army is more divided than in the other services.
                            Individual unit commanders of an action bent could <pb n="719"
                                facs="0759" xml:id="pg_719"/>take their men into the streets and
                            attempt to trigger a chain reaction leading to <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s ouster. This could
                            crystallize divisions within the military, especially if loyal units
                            fire on insurgents as in the June 29 rebellion. A further complication
                            is the possibility of insubordination and armed resistance within the
                            ranks in the event of a coup attempt. We doubt this would occur on any
                            massive scale, but the recent discovery of a MIR-inspired penetration of
                            the fleet has disquieted Chilean military leaders. The departure of
                            General <persName corresp="#p_PGC_1">Prats</persName> from the Army
                            probably reduces the chances for a divided army and a divided armed
                            forces in a given emergency situation.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sub-contingency Applicable to all Above
                            Contingencies in Varying Degrees:</p>
                        <p>Immediate leftist reaction to any indication of the impending likelihood
                            of one of the above contingencies could take the form of a non-violent
                            show of strength through strike action, the occupation of factories, and
                            street demonstrations. These are tactics favored by the Communists,
                            Radicals and some Socialists and could be used to try to overawe the
                            military and the country in general with working class support. Such
                            passive resistance or peaceful show of strength probably would not deter
                            or reverse the actions of a determined and unified military bent on
                            carrying out the above contingencies. Failing its objective, the <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> parties or elements thereof could turn
                            to armed resistance.</p>
                        <p>In general, the possibility of armed leftist resistance would tend to
                            increase from contingency A to D. The likelihood of a violent reaction
                            from the smaller, more extremist <gloss target="#t_MIR_1">MIR</gloss>
                            group and others including the <gloss target="#t_VOP_1">VOP</gloss> and
                            hardline Socialist Party youth elements exists under any of the
                            contingency situations described above. The <gloss target="#t_MIR_1"
                                >MIR</gloss> already receives assistance from Cuba and has close
                            ties to the Uruguayan Tupamaros and other terrorist organizations. Its
                            long threatened resort to armed struggle as the “only true road to
                            revolution” probably would be carried out whenever it became clear that
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s “peaceful path to
                            Socialism” had failed. We believe, however, that a united military could
                            control violent resistance or terrorist acts carried out by the
                            relatively small extreme left.</p>
                        <p>The problem of maintaining public order would be exacerbated if the
                            military were disunited and the larger U.P. political parties opted for
                            armed opposition. This possibility would be more likely under
                            contingency D than under contingencies A through C. Unless they sensed a
                            successful outcome, the Communists and Radicals in particular probably
                            would be inclined to avoid large-scale violence if possible and await
                            another opportunity to gain power. The Communists, for example, could
                            take comfort in the revolutionary gains already made by the <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime, much of which is not
                            likely to be undone by a successor government.</p>
                        <pb n="720" facs="0760" xml:id="pg_720"/>
                        <p>In addition to the extreme left, both the Socialist and Communist Party
                            shock brigades and security units possess arms and have some capability
                            to protect party headquarters and key installations. These, however, do
                            not yet encompass large numbers of party militants. <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> sources including <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> have frequently asserted that
                            any coup attempt would be countered by thousands of armed workers who
                            would seize factories and other vital installations to defend the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> Government by force
                            of arms. While much of this can be regarded as tactical rhetoric, the
                            Chilean military are not disposed to dismiss lightly the possibility of
                            having an armed showdown in the streets with thousands of <gloss
                                target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> militants. In fact, since the June 29
                            episode, the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> parties have been making
                            an effort to distribute arms to their partisans in the industrial belts
                            surrounding Santiago. Decisive and united military action could
                            forestall serious confrontations, while any evidence of military
                            indecision or disunity would tend to increase its chances of occurring.
                            In general, a milder form of military intervention, particularly one
                            which incorporated <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s
                            continuance in office or the military’s adherence at least to a
                            semblance of constitutional norms, would tend to mitigate an armed
                            leftist reaction except for those who are already violence prone.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">General Factors Affecting US Decisions:</p>
                        <p>We expect that any new government resulting from a military intervention
                            would quickly present us with urgent requests for substantial military
                            and economic assistance, based on a badly deteriorated economy and a
                            need to control disorders (of whatever magnitude). We also assume that,
                            to the extent any new government will represent a turn toward
                            moderation, we would wish to respond affirmatively to its needs. Our
                            basic problem would be how to respond positively given our policy and
                            legal constraints and given the magnitude of Chile’s economic problems
                            and financial limitations. We assume, given the nature and magnitude of
                            our bilateral compensation and debt differences, that these constraints
                            would continue for a time at least.</p>
                        <p>Our approach could be to separate out the emergency minimum essential
                            military and economic assistance which could be provided without
                            reference to our bilateral problems. Examples would be riot equipment
                            and relatively small food transfers. The more substantial elements of
                            economic assistance could depend on the kind of policy the new
                            government would adopt with respect to the outstanding issues of
                            compensation for expropriated American properties and debt rescheduling.
                            However, provision of emergency assistance to a successor government
                            would render us more vulnerable to the inevitable charges of political
                            involvement in Chilean internal affairs.</p>
                        <p>Within the variations included in the range of contingencies, a key
                            factor to any US decision would be whether any new government was <pb
                                n="721" facs="0761" xml:id="pg_721"/>essentially a caretaker pending
                            new elections, or whether it intended to remain in power indefinitely.
                            Only in the latter case could the new government be expected to take
                            significant decisions and actions on pending US-Chilean issues. In the
                            case of a caretaker government, such issues would probably have to
                            remain pending until the legally constituted successor government took
                            office. The following factors would have to be weighed:</p>
                        <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Outlook for the new Government’s Ability to
                                Govern</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In any of the contingencies listed above, it could be difficult to reach
                            a firm conclusion on this factor, at least at the outset of any new
                            government. Elements to consider would include the new government’s
                            effective control of the national territory (taking into account the
                            nature and extent of any subversive threat) and popular reaction to its
                            initiatives.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Likely Nature of its Domestic Political and Economic
                                Programs</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This factor is related to the preceding one and could signal what
                            positions the new government might take regarding relations with the US.
                            Additionally, the new government’s declarations on policy would have a
                            direct bearing on its general image and thus could significantly affect
                            reaction to it outside of Chile, including in the US Congress.</p>
                        <p>C. <hi rend="italic">Its General Foreign Policy</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Elements of particular importance in assessing this factor would be the
                            new government’s links to Cuba, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> and other socialist countries, the extent to which it
                            uses international forums against U.S. positions, and its willingness to
                            honor Chile’s international obligations.</p>
                        <p>D. <hi rend="italic">Likely Attitudes on Bilateral Issues with the
                                US</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The most important pending bilateral issues are Chile’s failure to pay
                            adequate compensation for expropriated US investments, particularly that
                            of the copper companies and <gloss target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> ; the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>’s unilateral moratorium on
                            payment of contracted debt; and the debt rescheduling begun in the Paris
                            Club.</p>
                        <p>The Ad Hoc Group believes that regardless of its desires, any successor
                            government to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> would find
                            it extremely difficult to reverse or openly back away from the public
                            positions already taken by the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> Government on these issues. For obvious reasons,
                            any new government can be expected to stress its nationalism and firm
                            adherence to Chile’s sovereign right to dispose of its natural resources
                            in accordance with its own laws. Thus, it would have to scrupulously
                            avoid any appearance of “selling out”—or already having sold out—to
                            “imperialist pressure”. This does not mean, however, that it could not
                                co<pb n="722" facs="0762" xml:id="pg_722"/>operate in seeking
                            mutually acceptable solutions to our bilateral problems.</p>
                        <p>E. <hi rend="italic">Likely Effect of US Posture on Chilean
                                Attitudes</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Similarly, the Ad Hoc Group believes that an overt indication by the U.S.
                            Government that it welcomed the change of government would reduce the
                            ability of a new government to reach an accommodation with us.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Categories of Decisions to Make</p>
                        <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Recognition</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Ad Hoc Group believes that in the event of a new government, once
                            that government has been firmly established, the US should confirm the
                            maintenance of relations seeking to be among neither the first nor the
                            last countries to extend recognition. The question of recognition does
                            not arise, of course, if there is no formal change of government. We
                            would want to consult with key Latin American governments about the
                            developing situation.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Setting the Tone of Relations</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Aside from the essentially mechanical question of recognition and the
                            less tractable bilateral issues, the US will be under great pressure to
                            specify its stance with regard to the new government in Chile. The Ad
                            Hoc Group recommends that our posture be a restrained and dispassionate
                            one in which we emphasize the strictly internal nature of, and entirely
                            Chilean responsibility for, developments in that country. We would note
                            that our future policies will depend on how our interests are affected.
                            We would scrupulously avoid any comment on how the change in government
                            might affect those interests.</p>
                        <p>C. <hi rend="italic">Bilateral Assistance</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>It is likely that any form of military intervention would result in a
                            request to the US for bilateral military assistance, particularly for
                            riot control equipment, tear gas supplies and possibly medical support
                            and Mobile Training Teams. In fact, an interest in purchasing riot
                            control equipment under <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credits
                            already has been communicated to us on an official basis. It might be
                            useful to process this request before any change in government occurs,
                            if the Chileans are willing to utilize unused past <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credits or pay cash.</p>
                        <p>In an emergency situation, sufficient riot control equipment and military
                            airlift capability are available in the Canal Zone to respond to
                            anticipated initial requests for such assistance. The Chilean Government
                            might possibly request assistance which would be highly visible <pb

                            identification between the US and the new government. An example would
                            be for internal helicopter or aircraft transportation service. In
                            response to such a request we could first seek to encourage support from
                            other Latin American countries considered capable of performing these
                            services, particularly Brazil, before deciding on whether US involvement
                            is warranted.</p>

                            assistance requests can also be expected, particularly for such items as

                            equipment and training also can be expected from the Carabineros; these
                            could be met through <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> Public Safety
                            programs or US military channels.</p>
                        <p>Chile is not currently a grant military matériel recipient, but could be
                            so designated under the pertinent provision of the Foreign Assistance
                            Act. The established, functioning foreign military sales and grant
                            military training programs with Chile could be augmented to meet the
                            need. Sections 620(e) (the <persName corresp="#p_HBB_1"
                                >Hickenlooper</persName> Amendment) and Sections 502, 620(q) and 653
                            of the Foreign Assistance Act would also have to be taken into
                            account.</p>

                        <p>If a clear-cut emergency situation existed in Chile which warranted the
                            provision of humanitarian disaster relief assistance, the U.S. would be
                            able to respond almost immediately to an official request. For example,
                            if an outbreak of fighting in Chile left large numbers of people
                            homeless, we could supply tents, blankets and other emergency equipment
                            from A.I.D. Disaster Relief stockpiles, provided that the Ambassador
                            declared a disaster and <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>/Washington
                            approved the shipments. About $200,000 of emergency equipment is kept in
                            Panama for this purpose at all times. The equipment could be transported
                            by U.S. military aircraft. Probable arrival time in Chile would be less
                            than 24 hours after an official request were received. The Ambassador
                            would also have authority to spend $25,000 for disaster relief purposes
                            as he saw fit. All cases involving Disaster Relief assistance must be
                            reported to the U.S. Congress. Therefore, we would have to be prepared
                            to justify the assistance in terms of the existing hardships for Chilean
                            citizens.</p>
                        <p>If there were an immediate need for food assistance, the food already in
                            Chile for our ongoing <gloss target="#t_PL480_1">PL–480</gloss> Title II
                            program could be used for emergency feeding. A report to the Congress is
                            not required for this type of assistance but the basis for providing the
                            assistance again would have to be in terms of existing rather than
                            potential hardships. The U.S. Voluntary Agencies operating the Title II
                            program in Chile would have to agree to the emergency feeding. They
                            might possibly be reluctant to agree if, because of worldwide food
                            shortages, the A.I.D.<pb n="724" facs="0764" xml:id="pg_724"/>Washington
                            Food for Peace Office were unable to guarantee the replacement of the
                            food used for the emergency.</p>
                        <p>Any new government in Chile would be faced with the need for massive
                            balance of payments assistance. The <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>
                            recently estimated that the 1973 balance of payments deficit will amount
                            to $338 million even if Chile obtains the maximum $290 million in relief
                            through debt payment deferments which it has requested. The problem, in
                            any event, would be so large and complicated that no one agency could
                            handle it, and it would be indispensable that there be close
                            coordination among the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_IDB_1">IDB</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_IBRD_1"
                                >IBRD</gloss>, Paris Club and the U.S. Government.</p>
                        <p>The capacity of the U.S. Government to respond to a request for balance
                            of payments assistance has declined considerably in recent years. The
                            principal means in the past has been through A.I.D. program lending;
                            however, there are many existing high-priority claims on very limited
                            funds. The same is true for supporting assistance funds which are
                            employed to meet major political requirements (e.g., Southeast Asia).
                            Regular development lending, either in the form of sector or project
                            loans, also faces serious funding constraints; moreover, the balance of
                            payments impact of this kind of lending is likely to be small during the
                            first year or two.</p>
                        <p>Aside from these funding limitations we would also have to take into
                            account various legislated restrictions in considering assistance to
                            Chile. These restrictions include requirements for prior Congressional
                            notification, the <persName corresp="#p_HBB_1">Hickenlooper</persName>
                            amendment, the <persName corresp="#p_GRE_1">Gonzalez</persName>
                            amendment, and Sections 620(a)(3) and 620(q) of the Foreign Assistance
                            Act.</p>
                        <p>Besides new A.I.D. assistance, the Chileans could request a reactivation
                            of the $15 million A.I.D. loan pipeline through extensions of the loan
                            terminal disbursement dates (<gloss target="#t_TDD_1">TDD</gloss>’s),
                            which are currently expired. Technical problems would have to be worked
                            out in several cases, however, before the <gloss target="#t_TDD_1"
                                >TDD</gloss>’s could be extended. Also, the immediate balance of
                            payments effect of the extensions would be small since the loans are
                            generally tied to specific projects or sectoral programs.</p>
                        <p>In sum, there are tight constraints on our ability to mount an A.I.D.
                            program of the dimension likely to be required. Should substantial
                            bilateral assistance prove politically and economically feasible and
                            desirable, we may want to consider a special request to Congress. This
                            kind of approach might also be used to waive the legislative restraints
                            mentioned above.</p>
                        <p>General balance of payments support could be requested through lines of
                            credit opened by the Export-Import Bank although it has a policy against
                            this type of lending. The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>’s
                            creditworthiness would affect the Bank’s response to a request for such
                            assistance. Important factors would be the Bank’s already high exposure
                            in Chile and whether the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> were
                            up-to-date in its repayments to the Bank (ex<pb n="725" facs="0765"
                                xml:id="pg_725"/>cept, of course, for those included in a bilateral
                            rescheduling agreement). The compensation issue would also be an
                            important factor in the Bank’s review of the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss>’s credit-worthiness.</p>
                        <p>Food import needs which are projected at $450 million in 1973, will be an
                            area of particular concern for any Chilean government during the coming
                            months. One source of long-term U.S. financing for food shipments is
                            Title I of <gloss target="#t_PL480_1">PL–480</gloss>. Probable terms for
                            sales to Chile would be up to 20 years. It would be very difficult,
                            however, to provide significant amounts of Title I assistance to Chile
                            during <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1974 due to possible statutory
                            restrictions, the reduction in Title I funding this year, and the severe
                            shortage of foodstuffs available for Title I programs. The commodity in
                            shortest supply is wheat, which is also the commodity for which Chile
                            has the greatest need. To ship Title I wheat to Chile would require a
                            diversion from top priority Asian countries and continued deferrals
                            under already signed agreements with other countries. For most other
                            commodities, the situation is almost as tight. With respect to corn for
                            example, enough is hoped to be available to meet existing commitments
                            but no surplus is expected for new programs. Only with vegetable oil is
                            there expected to be an adequate amount available for new
                            agreements.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_HBB_1">Hickenlooper</persName> amendment would
                            be applicable to Title I sales if it were invoked. Additionally, Title I
                            assistance may not be provided to governments making sales to Cuba or
                            permitting ships or aircraft of their registry to carry cargo to or from
                            Cuba. This restriction, which is subject to waiver, may be applicable to
                            Chile.</p>
                        <p>We have an ongoing <gloss target="#t_PL480_1">PL–480</gloss> Title II
                            grant program in Chile which currently amounts to about $2.5 million.
                            This is down sharply from previous years. Since the Title II program is
                            subject to the same commodity limitations as the Title I program,
                            further cuts during the year are a distinct possibility. An increase in
                            the program would be very difficult even if Chile were given top
                            priority. The <persName corresp="#p_HBB_1">Hickenlooper</persName>
                            amendment would apply to certain types of Title II programs if it were
                            invoked.</p>
                        <p>Another possible source of funding for food shipments to Chile would be
                            through the USDA’s Commodity Credit Corporation. The <gloss
                                target="#t_CCC_1">CCC</gloss>-financed commodities do not have to be
                            declared in surplus as they do for <gloss target="#t_PL480_1"
                                >PL–480</gloss> programs; therefore, the only supply restriction is
                            that an amount be available for export. Because of the uncertainties
                            with respect to this year’s supply, however, the <gloss
                                target="#t_CCC_1">CCC</gloss> currently is not approving new lines
                            of credit and requests from countries such as Poland, the Philippines,
                            and South Korea are being held in abeyance. The <gloss target="#t_CCC_1"
                                >CCC</gloss> is continuing to provide financing under
                            already-approved lines, however, and it expects to be able to approve
                            new lines of credit later in the fiscal year. <gloss target="#t_CCC_1"
                                >CCC</gloss> financing terms are very close to commercial rates. <pb

                        <p>While military and economic aid might be called for to shore up a

                            It would lend credence to the inevitable charge that the US masterminded

                            that the Chilean military intervention adhered to constitutional norms
                            and by the care with which we determined the timing and nature of our

                            fairly rapidly. However, there are outstanding technical problems in

                            provided that Chile was willing to comply with some fairly restrictive
                            financial conditions. If it agreed to maintain balance of payments
                            equilibrium over a twelve month period and to contain inflation the
                                <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> very likely would authorize a
                            $43 million first credit tranche drawing. To fulfill such a commitment,
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> would probably have to cut back
                            sharply on current imports, or obtain additional financing from other
                            sources. A second credit tranche (standby) of $43 million would also be
                            possible if Chile agreed to further monetary and financial commitments.
                            These <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> drawings could provide needed
                            balance of payments relief relatively <pb n="727" facs="0767"

                        </p>
                        <p>As provided for in the multilateral debt rescheduling agreement of April
                            1972 (Paris Club), we have discussed a bilateral debt rescheduling with
                            the Chileans; an agreement would reschedule 70% of the repayments which
                            fell due within the November 1971–December 1972 period. Since Chile has
                            not been making any payments to the U.S., payment of the 30% due under
                            the bilateral agreement plus other excluded repayments might mean an
                            immediate balance of payments drain for Chile. However, we could agree
                            to more favorable rescheduling terms if we wished.</p>
                        <p>Multilateral talks in the Paris Club have been underway this year on the
                            rescheduling of Chile’s 1973 and possibly, 1974 debt. Significant
                            balance of payments relief could be provided if we agreed to Chile’s
                            proposed terms—rescheduling over a ten-year period of 95% of the
                            payments due in 1973 and 1974. The other creditors might not be willing
                            to agree to such liberal terms in the multilateral format, but we could
                            agree to such terms in the subsequent bilateral negotiations. However,
                            it could be embarrassing for the U.S. to reverse the “orthodox” approach
                            we have applied to debt rescheduling for the <persName

                        <p>Before the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs, Committee on
                            Foreign Relations, September 12, 1973</p>
                        <p>Senator Church: We may not have engineered that overthrow in Brazil, but
                            information that has come to this Committee and been authenticated shows
                            we had lots do with it in the end. The same as now is true with
                            Chile.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName>: To the best of my
                            knowledge, no sir. (p. 15)</p>
                        <p>Senator Church: There were two events, one the miners’ strike that has
                            been well publicized, which apparently was undertaken to bring down the
                            government or it may have had that as its objective. And the other is
                            the “pots and pans” demonstration that took place earlier, much to the
                            embarrassment of the Government, I think. Were we involved in any way in
                            either of those activities? Were we behind them in any way? Was the
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> involved in them? Did we give
                            financial support to them? (p. 24)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName>: No.</p>
                        <p>Before the House Subcommittee on Inter-American Affairs, September 20,
                            1973</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName>: In sum, it is untrue
                            to say that the United States Government was responsible either directly
                            or indirectly for the overthrow of the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> Regime. (p. 8)</p>
                        <p>We were not responsible for the difficulty in which Chile found itself.
                            It is not for us to judge what would have been best or will now be best
                            for the Chilean people. (p. 9)</p>
                        <p>Mr. Fascell: ... The question is whether or not the U.S. Government
                            directly or indirectly financed in any way the activities of the
                            opposition of the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            Government. (p. 45)</p>
                        <pb n="729" facs="0769" xml:id="pg_729"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName>: Mr. Chairman, here
                            again I think this is something that we should discuss in an executive
                            session. I really don’t want to get into any statements today in a
                            public session that could be carried on the press that would give
                            misleading impressions abroad. I certainly don’t want to add to that. I
                            just want to reaffirm categorically that we were not involved in any way
                            in the overthrow of President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> or his government, not the U.S. Government and
                            not any element of the U.S. Government, including the Central
                            Intelligence Agency. (p. 45)</p>
                        <p>Mr. Fascell: The official answer is that the United States Government
                            knows nothing about it (Operation Centaur) and was not involved in any
                            way? (p. 46)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName>: That’s right.</p>
                        <p>Before the Executive Session of the Subcommittee on Inter-American
                            Affairs, September 25, 1973</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName>: Mr. Fraser, I will
                            tell you all that I know that I am sure of, and that I feel authorized
                            to speak on. In that connection, I want to exclude my competence to
                            testify on <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> activities in Chile
                            prior to the time I became Assistant Secretary of State on May 29th of
                            this year. (p. 23)</p>
                        <p>Separate limitations on what I feel qualified or authorized to speak to.
                            Yes; that is correct. In other words, I don’t feel qualified nor am I
                            prepared to go back and discuss all the allegations about <gloss
                                target="#t_ITT_1">ITT</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss> going back to early this year, or last year, or alleged
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> involvement in clandestine
                            activities in Chile. (p. 24)</p>
                        <p>I believe that if the Subcommittee wants to get into that kind of
                            information it should get someone who is better equipped to respond to
                            those questions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Fraser: Let me ask you this question, Mr. Secretary: Were there any
                            decisions taken by the National Security Council regarding the position
                            of the United States in giving tacit or covert encouragement or support
                            to opposition groups in Chile let’s say during 1973?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName>: I am thinking
                            carefully about this because it is an important question, Mr. Fraser.
                            (p. 25)</p>
                        <p>I cannot recall any <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> decisions of
                            that type.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Fraser: I am not asking if decisions were made during this year; if
                            they were operated during this year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName>: I know of none.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName>: Well, I am familiar
                            with <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> operations in Chile; yes. I
                            believe I am, and I believe I am fully informed at the moment on <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> activities in Chile, both
                            intelligence-gathering, counter-intelligence, and their other activities
                            there.</p>
                        <p>But, as an official of the Department of State, I do not feel really
                            competent to speak for <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and its
                            activities in Chile. (p. 26)</p>
                        <pb n="730" facs="0770" xml:id="pg_730"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName>: If I may just make a
                            general observation on that, without trying to speak for <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Fraser, I would
                            say this:</p>
                        <p>In my judgment—I speak this very honestly and candidly and sincerely—the
                            kinds of things that you have in mind, I believe—I think it would be a
                            mistake to think that the United States did anything that had any kind
                            of significant impact on what has happened in Chile. I do not exclude
                            the possibility that there were some small program or activities that
                            within the United States Government there was sponsorship of, but
                            compared to what the situation was in Chile, compared to what has
                            happened—and taken in the context of what has happened in Chile—I would
                            say they were insignificant or nearly insignificant, what I know of
                            them. (p. 27)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName>: I am certainly not
                            here to try and obfuscate you or the members of this committee. (p.
                            28)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName>: Yes. I thought I
                            made that clear to Mr. Fraser and subsequently to you, but if I did not,
                            my impression is I know everything they do in the large programs,
                            activities, number of personnel, what their programs are, et cetera.
                            Yes. (p. 36)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName>: . . . our policy in
                            recent months was—as far as Chile was concerned—not to do anything to
                            bring about the overthrow of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>. (p. 58)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName>: There were
                            individuals who came to U.S. representatives and said, “Will you help
                            the truckers in their strike, or will you help others who are fomenting
                            work stoppages, others who are trying to bring about problems for the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime and trying to
                            bring about the government’s downfall?” (p. 60)</p>
                        <p>When those proposals came the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName>: I would never come

                        <p>We are not trying to keep anything from you or this Committee on that

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName>: There were other

                            that a proposal was made and discussions took place between <gloss

                            <p>Our Embassy has made numerous representations to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> concerning American firms
                                nationalized or intervened under the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> government. Many of these firms have also
                                engaged in direct negotiation with the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                    >GOC</gloss> or its entities.</p>
                            <p>Since December 1972, we have engaged in formal negotiations aimed at
                                reaching a settlement to the dispute arising out of the 1971 copper
                                nationalizations. Other nationalized American firms have been
                                mentioned only marginally in the course of these conversations. Four
                                bilateral sessions have been held, the latest in Washington August
                                16–17. We have sought Chilean agreement either to submit the dispute
                                to an expeditious binding third party arbitration or to utilize some
                                other means which would permit the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                    >GOC</gloss> to pay compensation to the copper companies. The

                                decision of the Special Copper Tribunal refusing to review <persName

                                companies owed excess profits exceeding book value are legal
                                obstacles for the Chileans.</p>
                            <pb n="733" facs="0773" xml:id="pg_733"/>
                            <p>The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> has said in effect that it
                                could not pay compensation to the companies without additional
                                legislation and/or constitutional amendment, and has refused to
                                accept binding arbitration on the ground that such acceptance would
                                also require Congressional approval. Chile has asked that the
                                dispute be submitted to non-binding conciliation procedures under a
                                1914 bilateral treaty, but has been vague about how the results of
                                such procedure would be implemented internally. At the August
                                meeting Chile suggested a procedure by which (a) an international
                                panel would find that the proceedings of the Special Copper Tribunal
                                amounted to a denial of justice, and (b) the Tribunal would reopen
                                excess profits and other key issues, with the Chilean executive
                                committed to pay compensation if such a finding were rendered by the
                                Tribunal. The United States indicated its dissatisfaction with this
                                procedure, but it was agreed that prior to the next meeting we would
                                submit to Chile a list of questions concerning various aspects.</p>

                            <p>We have for the most part avoided formal involvement in negotiations.
                                However, our Embassies in Panama, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru have
                                assisted various U.S. corporations in attempting to reach
                                settlements of expropriations or other takings of those governments.
                                In one instance, Bolivia, several American mining firms were able to
                                reach settlement agreements on nationalizations with the assistance
                                of the Embassy in 1972 after the Torres Government was succeeded by
                                the more moderate Banzer regime. In Peru, President <persName

                        <p>Attached is a paper for the Washington Special Actions Group which
                            outlines the general magnitude of economic needs of the new Chilean
                            Government; examines resources available within the U.S. Government, the
                            international institutions, and other governments to meet Chile’s needs;
                            and recommends that we send a team composed of representatives of
                            A.I.D., the Departments of Agriculture and Treasury, and the
                            Export-Import Bank to Santiago as soon as conditions permit to develop
                            programs which will help meet the new Government’s immediate needs. It
                            also recommends that we encourage the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"

                            <p>The September 11 coup in Chile occurred at a time of deepening
                                economic crisis and chaos. Inflation, which had reached levels of 22
                                percent in 1971 and 163 percent in 1972, was pointing toward a 200
                                percent or greater surge in 1973. During 1971 and 1972, the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> government lost
                                more than $600 million; it inherited $340 million in foreign
                                exchange reserves from the Frei government (and is now in a negative
                                reserve position) and this notwithstanding virtual 100 percent
                                relief (through default) from payments to <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                    >USG</gloss> creditors and very substantial relief from payment
                                to other creditors. There have been widespread and increasingly
                                serious shortages of foodstuffs and consumer goods. At the root of
                                these phenomena was an economic policy designed to effect rapid
                                income redistribution, resulting in a spiraling fiscal deficit. The
                                    <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>’s price, income and
                                exchange rate policies have also contributed to the
                                disequilibrium.</p>
                            <p>As the economy has gotten further and further out of kilter,
                                circumstances have become increasingly propitious for strikes.
                                Particularly disruptive and costly strikes have occurred in the
                                copper and transportation sectors; the coup occurred on the 47th day
                                of a paralyzing truckers’ strike.</p>
                            <p>Consequently, the new government confronts enormous problems in
                                putting the economy back together and cannot possibly succeed
                                without very substantial external help. It has effectively exhausted
                                its international reserves, yet faces another whopping balance of
                                payments deficit, compounded by extraordinary food import
                                requirements attributable largely to the disruption of the
                                agriculture sector by <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> policies. About the only bright spot is the
                                rapid rise of world copper prices in recent months (from 46 cents
                                per pound at the end of 1972 to about 85 cents currently). However,
                                nationalization of the mines and labor strife have resulted in
                                drastically reduced—and higher cost—production.</p>
                            <pb n="736" facs="0776" xml:id="pg_736"/>
                            <p>Particularly urgent is the shortage of foodstuffs, wheat foremost
                                among them. We have one unverified report that 300,000 tons will be
                                needed for the balance of 1973. Complicating the wheat problems may
                                be the inability of Chilean ports to handle the quantities
                                needed.</p>
                            <p>Also in acute shortage are spare parts, particularly for vehicles. We
                                also have a report that pharmaceuticals are in short supply. Of
                                course, should widespread fighting break out, additional
                                requirements for emergency feeding, shelter, and medical supplies
                                could develop.</p>
                            <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Stages of Economic Effort</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>The new government confronts three stages of economic effort. The
                                first is a consolidation stage during which the government must try
                                to create economic conditions which will facilitate a degree of
                                normalization of national life which will, in turn, facilitate its
                                consolidation of power. Priority goals during this stage, which can
                                be expected to last for several months, will be the normalization of
                                public services and the increased availability of foodstuffs and
                                other critical commodities.</p>
                            <p>The second stage can be called the economic stabilization stage; it
                                will overlap both the first and third stages. The new <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> inherits a bankrupt and contorted
                                economy. Much will depend on the policies it chooses and the
                                external support, both technical and financial, that it receives.
                                The stabilization program is likely to take several months to
                                develop; because of the severity of the disequilibrium, the
                                execution of the program is likely to be both drawn out and
                                difficult.</p>
                            <p>The stabilization program will have better prospects and be easier to
                                bear if the third, or development, stage moves ahead promptly and
                                effectively. The rehabilitation and expansion of the copper industry
                                can be thought of as one of the keystones of this stage; also of
                                great importance is agricultural rehabilitation and development.</p>

                            <p>Despite the present uncertainties in Chile, for planning purposes we
                                make the assumption that the new Chilean government will urgently
                                seek external assistance, both short- and long-term, in order to
                                consolidate its position and to restore the economy of Chile. We
                                make the further assumption, for planning purposes, that the United
                                States will determine it to be in its national interest to respond
                                positively to such a request. In such a circumstance, however, we
                                believe that, for financial and technical as well as political
                                reasons, the United States effort should be part of a larger effort
                                of various international and other sources of assistance, and that
                                the role of the U.S. should not be the leading one. That function is
                                probably most appropriate for the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1"

                                well be in the best position to respond rapidly and

                                relevant: supporting assistance, for which the rationale is the

                                where a development need is being met. First quarter <gloss

                                for on-going needs in Southeast Asia and Pakistan flood relief.
                                Amounts made available in the new Continuing Resolution that will be

                                ability to respond from this account will depend on the duration and
                                size of the Continuing Resolution that will be required on October

                            <p>The needs for external resources during the consolidation stage may

                                every effort should be made to assure the most concessional possible
                                financing for Chile, given the enormity of the balance of payments
                                problems facing it.) Unfortunately, the world food shortage has led
                                to unprecedented rigidities in <gloss target="#t_PL480_1"
                                    >PL–480</gloss> programs. There are only two Title I wheat

                            <p>Assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act is proscribed to

                                    >PL–480</gloss> contains a similar proscription and also
                                proscribes assistance to countries whose governments make matériel
                                assistance available to Cuba. (Both the <gloss target="#t_PL480_1"
                                    >PL–480</gloss> prohibitions under certain circumstances can be
                                waived by a national interest determination.) Presumably the
                                attitude of the new <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> toward Cuba
                                will obviate problems on this score.</p>
                            <p>There is also a prohibition of assistance to countries in default on
                                Foreign Assistance Act loan payments. Chile is currently one such
                                country. This prohibition can, however, be waived by a national
                                interest determination (which has already been done for technical
                                assistance by the Secretary of State).</p>
                            <p>The law requires justification to the Congress for supporting
                                assistance programs not included in the Congressional
                                Presentation.</p>
                            <p>Finally, under an agreement between A.I.D. and the Subcommittee on
                                Foreign Operations of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the
                                Subcommittee Chairman must be notified of proposed loans which have
                                not been presented to Congress.</p>
                            <p>The foregoing legislative problems do not in any event apply in the
                                case of the Export-Import Bank, which might be an appropriate source
                                for the kind of financing Chile needs, given its economic woes, for
                                spare parts, pharmaceuticals, and perhaps other key commodities the
                                availability of which will contribute to achievement of
                                consolidation objectives. A line of credit arrangement might provide
                                a convenient device. Ex-Im would want to reach some understandings
                                on its future relationships with the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"

                            <p>If a clear-cut emergency situation existed in Chile which warranted
                                the provision of humanitarian disaster relief assistance, the U.S.
                                would be able to respond almost immediately to an official request.
                                For example, if an outbreak of fighting in Chile left large numbers
                                of people homeless, we could supply tents, blankets and other
                                emergency equipment from A.I.D. Disaster Relief stockpiles. All
                                cases involving Disaster Relief assistance must be reported to the
                                U.S. Congress. Similarly, if there were an immediate need for food
                                assistance, the food already in <pb n="739" facs="0779"

                            <p>We may wish to consider expansion of the Title II program even in the
                                absence of conditions which would qualify for disaster relief. This
                                would be particularly true if there were widespread unemployment and
                                hunger. We would, however, want to do this only in the case of very
                                clear need because of the difficulty of reducing or terminating such
                                programs after the emergency passes and because of the extreme
                                tightness of <gloss target="#t_PL480_1">PL–480</gloss>
                                availabilities.</p>
                            <p>All of the foregoing program tools could play a role during the
                                stabilization and development stages. However, the magnitude of
                                requirements during these stages may be so great, particularly in
                                the light of substantial recent reductions in A.I.D. and <gloss

                                seek special authority for Chile, even assuming that other
                                institutions take leadership roles. As an example, the entire

                                The dimensions of needed external resources are likely to be so
                                great that indeed without the involvement of these institutions, as

                            <p>The role of the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> is critical.
                                Because of its staff work for the Paris Club, it has a better

                                institution. It has a natural leadership role among external

                                could qualify Chile for a standby agreement which could yield it
                                substantially more. The <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> could
                                also be extremely helpful to Chile in its negotiations with its

                                important because of its likely ideological identification with the

                            <p>A. We encourage the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> to make
                                early contact with the international financial institutions,

                            Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs Jack Kubisch was asked to

                            were other Senators in addition to Senator <persName corresp="#p_MGW_1"
                                >McGee</persName> and that Senator <persName corresp="#p_MGW_1"
                                >McGee</persName> wished to have a confidential briefing from Mr.

                                >Allende</persName> in Chile.</p>
                        <p>During the session Senator Javits asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1"
                                >Kubisch</persName> to convey to the White House his hope that the
                            President would consider making a public statement about <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s overthrow. Specifically,
                            Senator Javits suggested that the Presidential statement “deplore the
                            abrupt end of constitutional government” in Chile, affirm his “great
                            interest and concern” about developments there, and his hope for “early
                            elections” that would return Chile to constitutional government and a
                            free and democratic society. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MGW_1"
                                >McGee</persName> supported Senator Javits’ suggestion.</p>
                        <pb n="742" facs="0782" xml:id="pg_742"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName> debated with the
                            Senators the advisability of such a statement given the unclear
                            situation in Chile, the fact that what had happened was entirely an
                            internal Chilean matter, and the need for the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> to consider all of its interests in that country
                            including its relations with whatever new government might emerge.</p>
                        <p>Following the formal session, Senators Javits and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGW_1">McGee</persName> repeated informally their
                            suggestion that such a Presidential statement be made but they also
                            recognized that such a statement might be deemed inadvisable for a
                            variety of reasons. They intimated that there may also have been some
                            other reason for handling the matter the way they did—that is, to head
                            off a more undesirable action by the Committee or some of its
                            members.</p>

                            presidential election. Our role in the election was limited to an effort

                            a number of congressional by-elections. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines not

                            both the <gloss target="#t_UP_1">UP</gloss> and the opposition as a form
                            of plebiscite to determine whether or not the government had a popular
                            mandate to continue the implementation of its revolutionary program.
                                [<hi rend="italic">4 lines not declassified</hi>] Funds authorized
                            by the 40 Committee were also used to insure the continued existence of
                                <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi>, Chile’s largest and most
                            important newspaper, which acted as an effective rallying-point for
                            opposition forces. Limited support was also made available to private
                            sector organizations, but because some of these groups began to try to
                            provoke a military coup, our funding was confined to specific activities
                            in support of the opposition coalition in the March congressional
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>3. After the March 1973 elections, it became increasingly apparent that
                            three years of political polarization had strained the fabric of Chilean
                            society to the breaking point. Various U.S. policy options were
                            considered, and on 20 August 1973 the 40 Committee approved an
                            additional $1,000,000 to support opposition political parties and
                            private sector organizations through June 1974; support to the private
                            sector, however, was made contingent on the concurrence of Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DN_1">Davis</persName> and the Department of
                            State. Since this concurrence was not given, no support was provided to
                            the private sector, whose initiative in launching and maintaining a
                            series of crippling strikes was instrumental in provoking the military
                            coup of 11 September 1973. Thus, while the Agency was instrumental in
                            enabling opposition political parties and media to survive and to
                            maintain their dynamic resistance to the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> regime, the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                            played no direct role in the events which led to the establishment of

                                >Korry</persName> considered the three options transmitted to him
                            over other channels, he should consider the “fourth option”: i.e., the
                            overthrow of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> or the
                            prevention of his inauguration. <persName corresp="#p_CJH_1"
                                >Crimmins</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName> to comment on: the prospect that the Chilean
                            military and police would act on their own to overthrow <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>; their prospects for success
                            if they made such a try; and the importance of the U.S. attitude to the
                            initiation or success of such an operation.</p>
                        <p>August 11—<persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> replied to
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJH_1">Crimmins</persName>’ 5 August message
                            that he would not regard the fourth option as a very realistic
                            alternative and that it was one that in any event could be considered
                            only as part of “Phase II”; i.e., after the general elections and prior
                            to inauguration. If <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> were
                            inaugurated by constitutional process, it was highly unlikely that there
                            would be conditions for a military overthrow; only a condition of chaos
                            could be an effective impulse for army intervention once congress
                            elected <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. Any military
                            effort after inauguration would be almost impossible. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> went on to say that it was
                            doubtful that there would be any effective army move to block <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. The idea of a military <gloss
                                target="#t_golpe_1">golpe</gloss> without the blessing of Frei and
                            without outside support in the form of technical assistance or political
                            action was a non-starter. <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>,
                            speculating on the possible scenario of an Alessandri rejection of a
                            narrow popular-vote win and subsequent election with Frei as a candidate
                            (President of the Senate acting as interim President) and Frei election,
                            said that such a progression would work only with military support.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> added that he could
                            not conceive of any supportable scheme for a U.S. role strictly limited
                            to the military. In Phase II, he said, the U.S. would have an
                            opportunity to play a constructive role in which the military would be
                            included.</p>

                        <p>Sept. 8—40 Committee agreed there was little likelihood of success in
                            buying congressional votes. <persName corresp="#p_HR_1">Helms</persName>
                            said that a military <gloss target="#t_golpe_1">golpe</gloss> (which he
                            noted he was not advocating) would have little chance of success unless
                            undertaken soon. <persName corresp="#p_PD_1">Packard</persName> agreed
                            and said he hoped that the Chilean military would undertake such action
                            soon on its own initiative. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1"
                                >Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MCA_1"
                                >Meyer</persName> noted that if <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s election were frustrated by a military
                            take-over, a full scale civil war would result. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> was probably the lesser of the
                            two evils. The chairman called for an assessment of the pros and cons
                            involved in the organization of a Chilean military coup with U.S.
                            assistance.</p>
                        <p>Sept. 9—<gloss target="#t_CAS_1">CAS</gloss> Headquarters, in a message
                            to Santiago, asked for an assessment of the possibility of any action by
                            the Chilean military. In introducing its message, <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> stated that the 40 Committee on 8
                            September, in considering “the possibility of manipulation of Chilean
                            Congressional and military action, decided to give serious consideration
                            only to the latter possibility.” <gloss target="#t_CAS_1">CAS</gloss>
                            was authorized to make appropriate contacts to obtain information but
                            was instructed not to incite or organize at this point.</p>
                        <p>Sept. 12—<persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>, presumably
                            replying to same (8 September) query, said that it was clear that the
                            Chilean military would not move, barring national chaos and wide spread
                            violence. He said that if the Alessandri/Frei gambit were to be
                            undertaken, the military would have no part to play in it until the
                            final act. Here, he said, Frei was the problem. The success of the
                            enterprise would depend on Frei’s will and skill. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> summed up by saying that
                            opportunities for further significant U.S. action with the Chilean
                            military were non-existent; they knew they had U.S. blessings for any
                            serious move against <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            but, while the message could be repeated if circumstances so dictated,
                            it would be imprudent and unreasonable to go further.</p>
                        <p>Sept. 14—The 40 Committee, through <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1"
                                >Johnson</persName>, instructed <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName> to find out from Frei to what degree he was
                            committed to the gambit of a congressional election of Alessandri with a
                            subsequent Alessandri resignation that would leave Frei free to run for
                            the Presidency. Suitable and discreet U.S. support was to be indicated
                            for this effort if Frei wished it. The Committee further requested
                            military contacts by all appropriate mission members on an intensified
                            basis in order to assure that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            had the requisite intelligence to permit independent assessment of the
                            military determination to back the Frei reelection gambit. In the course
                            of this message, <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> was
                            reminded of his contingency fund of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>] that had been made available for covert support
                            of projects that Frei thought important. <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName> was told that his role was a very delicate one
                            requiring him to walk a fine line.</p>
                        <pb n="749" facs="0789" xml:id="pg_749"/>
                        <p>Sept. 16—<persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>, in the course of
                            his reply, said that the Committee instructions regarding the military
                            would be applied by him in a manner best designed to obtain optimum
                            political mileage and the necessary intelligence on military plans. He
                            said there was little hope that the military could be galvanized into
                            action by anything the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> might do;
                            they were a union of toy soldiers.</p>
                        <p>[N.B.: In the introduction to this message, <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName> said that he was “extremely grateful for the
                            confidence and support of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                >Nixon</persName> and the 40 Committee”. It will be recalled that it
                            was at this time that <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> is
                            reported in the Anderson papers to have said that he had a “green light”
                            from the State Department and the White House. Both <persName
                                corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>’s expression of gratitude in his
                            16 September reply and his “green light” statement appear
                            disproportionately exuberant when compared to the license extended him
                            in the 15 September message (which makes no mention of the President),
                            or in any other communication to him that we know of. It thus appears
                            possible that another communication to <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"

                            the danger of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> to the
                            scenario which would result in an entrance of military officers into the

                        <p>Sept. 24—<persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> reported that Frei
                            had ruled out cabinet resignations with military replacement, on the
                            pretext that this would do nothing more than assure a constitutional
                            election of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. He said
                            also that Frei had informed <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1"
                                >Schneider</persName> that the congressional formula was out and
                            that it was the military or nothing and that a Marxist government would
                            probably end U.S. military aid. <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName> said that, according to his informant, <persName

                            support for his [<persName corresp="#p_SCR_1">Schneider</persName>’s]
                            constitutionalist doctrine.</p>

                                >CAS</gloss> Channels that <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName>’s message was puzzling; Washington had assumed
                            that the offer of financial support to Frei would encourage him to take
                            whatever action was necessary to block <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> and also that the assurances to the Chilean
                            military of continued support if they participated in this effort would
                            also encourage them. <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> was
                            told that he should be clear that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> hoped the Chileans would find a way to block <persName

                            the assurances he had been authorized to give were sufficient, he should

                            message, said there was no necessity of his giving assurances of any
                            kind to Frei since he had emphasized from the start that whatever Frei
                            did would be Chilean and only Chilean.</p>

                            would welcome the U.S. doing his dirty work for him by seeking to
                            provoke a military takeover but that he, <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName>, was convinced that we could not provoke one and

                            with other military leaders to explain that there was no hope of a

                        <p>Sept. 28—<persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> reported hearing
                            indirectly from an Anaconda representative that a group of military
                            persons (below the top level) was prepared to launch a coup if they

                            that he had given no answer to this indirect approach other than to
                            remind his interlocutor that <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>’s adherents might be attempting to provoke an

                            travel should be suspended and that the Chilean military might be so
                            informed.</p>
                        <p>Oct. 5—<persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> suggested that
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss> deliveries should be described
                            as “held in abeyance” since the term “suspension” might cause a reaction
                            favorable to <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Oct. 6—In a message to <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>,
                            apparently from <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>, the
                            Ambassador was notified of the Committee’s concurrence to hold Chilean
                            military training and travel in abeyance and of its concurrence in a
                            recommendation that delivery of military equipment to the Chilean Armed
                            Forces should also be held in abeyance and that it should be made known
                            to those forces that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would not
                            discriminate against them in the event of a non-<persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> Government.</p>
                        <p>Oct. 7—In another message to <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName>, this time from <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1"
                                >Johnson</persName>, the same points were made except that the point
                            about discrimination was made a little more explicit. “You have also
                            previously been authorized to inform the military that if the effort to
                            block <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> from taking office
                            is successful, the Chilean military will not be ostracized, but rather
                            can continue to count on us for <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss>
                            support and maintenance of our close relationship”. The message went on
                            to say that <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> was now
                            authorized to inform discreetly the Chilean military that, if a
                            successful effort were made to block <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName>, the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would
                            reconsider its cuts in Chilean<gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss> and
                            would otherwise increase programmed <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss>
                            for the Chilean Armed Forces. Increased ship loans were also a
                            possibility. “If any steps the military should take should result in
                            civil disorder, we would also be prepared promptly to deliver support
                            and material that might be immediately required. Obviously we cannot,
                            and we assume Chilean Forces do not want, sup<pb n="752" facs="0792"
                                xml:id="pg_752"/>port of American personnel in such a contingency”.
                            The message concluded by saying that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> would not want the Chilean military to be deterred by
                            what they might feel was ambiguity with respect to the U.S. attitude
                            toward the election of <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>.
                            It was left to <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>’s
                            discretion on how all this could best and most promptly be communicated
                            to the military.</p>
                        <p>Oct. 9—In response, <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> said
                            that he had taken every appropriate measure to make known to the Chilean
                            military the points about<gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss>suspension
                            and how the Chilean military could count on continued <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss> support and a close relationship with
                            the U.S. should a successful effort be made to block <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>. He went on to say, however,
                            that as far as a coup was concerned, he was unalterably persuaded that
                            the U.S. could and should do nothing to encourage such an action. He
                            said as well that any effort to block <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> by offering more <gloss target="#t_MAP_1"
                                >MAP</gloss> would be totally ineffective and might even produce a
                            contrary reaction. He said that his own view and that of his senior
                            State associates was that the odds were overwhelmingly against a
                            successful coup without Frei and/or <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1"
                                >Schneider</persName>. In sum, he said, any attempt on the part of
                            the U.S. activity to encourage a coup could lead the U.S. to a Bay of
                            Pigs failure. An abortive coup (and this, he said, was what was under
                            discussion) would be an unrelieved disaster for the U.S. and for the
                            President that would do the gravest harm to U.S. interests throughout
                            Latin America. There was no basis, he said, for any hope that there was
                            a reasonable chance of success for any action program.</p>

                            and that discreet contacts with the Chilean military should be

                            campaign, on grounds revelation U.S. involvement would be worse than

                            a suitable and discreet way. <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"

                                >Korry</persName> was told that military contacts by appropriate

                            said he was aware of the delicacy of his situation. That through an

                            appropriate support if Frei would only act. That there was little hope
                            that the military could be galvanized into action; they were toy
                            soldiers. <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> reminded

                            there would be violence but that there was less than an even chance of
                            long term insurgency. If the coup succeeded, the resulting government
                            would have a very difficult problem in maintaining law and order; if it
                            failed the military would be destroyed; external assistance would
                            probably be necessary.</p>

                            over <gloss target="#t_CAS_1">CAS</gloss> channels said that there was
                            no necessity for him to give assurances of any kind to Frei since he,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName>, had emphasized from

                                <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> said, was at zero
                            level and no risk had been taken. <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName> still had his doubts about a coup. Embassy was
                            operating under strictest orders to seek no contacts of any kind.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> said he would welcome
                            a reversal of the Department’s position of diplomatic non-action with
                            our friends, especially the British.</p>

                        <p>September 25—<persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> reported that
                            Frei would welcome the US doing his dirty work for him by seeking to
                            provoke a military coup, but <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1"
                                >Korry</persName> said that he was convinced that we could not
                            provoke one and that we should not run any risk simply to have another
                            Bay of Pigs. He therefore had instructed strongly his military and

                            of any kind. <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> commented

                            become president. <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> said he

                            suggestions with US companies in the US, particularly if one totally

                            community should mention specifics in any propaganda it spread in order
                            to push savings and loan associations over the edge; and persuade
                            Anaconda to accede to union demands. The rest of <persName

                        <p>September 25—<persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> took back his

                            it had been up to now. Beyond suggesting economic pressures by working

                            hearing from Anaconda representative that a group of military persons
                            was prepared to launch a coup if it could get appropriate assurances

                            conversations with Ford. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>

                                <persName corresp="#p_VVP_1">Vaky</persName> said what we were

                            said action was imperative. It was emphasized that there would be no

                            said that this sort of economic warfare amounted to a change in foreign

                        <p>October 9—<persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> reported that he
                            had taken every appropriate measure to make the points made in the

                            to the military. He said, however, that he was “unalterably persuaded”
                            that the US could and should do nothing to encourage coup action. The
                            odds were, he said, overwhelmingly against a successful coup without the
                            compliance and commitment of Frei and/or <persName corresp="#p_SCR_1"
                                >Schneider</persName>. Any attempt to encourage a coup could lead to
                            a Bay of Pigs failure. He said he had been appalled to learn that there
                            was liaison for coup plotting among <persName corresp="#p_RGP_1">Pablo

                            and the President. It would, he said, be disastrously risky and
                            recommended that the US should disassociate itself promptly from any
                            association with <persName corresp="#p_RGP_1">Rodriguez</persName>, and

                                Government was a failure. On the economic side, his Administration
                                had brought Chile in less than three years from a relatively
                                prosperous and stable position to a point of utter bankruptcy.

                                Widespread shortages of foodstuffs and consumer goods had

                            <p>At the time of the coup last Tuesday, the country was paralyzed
                                economically and near social chaos. Truckers were in the 47th day of
                                their strike and public transportation had been brought to a virtual
                                halt. Distribution facilities were not functioning. The middle
                                classes—shopkeepers, doctors, housewives, etc.—were demonstrating
                                against the Government. Even the workers had suffered heavily, as a
                                result of the inflation, under the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> regime. Misguided monetary, fiscal and
                                economic policies had carried the annual rate of inflation to almost
                                300%. There had been prolonged and costly strikes by the copper
                                miners.</p>
                            <p>The country simply could not go on in this fashion. <persName

                                because his Government and its policies were an absolute
                                failure.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">SUGGESTED REPLY:</hi> Frankly, we regret this
                                interruption of Chile’s long democratic tradition. We certainly
                                regret very much such a violent end to President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s regime and his own
                                death. However, I do not believe that any of us are in a position to
                                make a value judgment about what happened last week in Chile. It is
                                not for us to say whether the people of Chile would have been better
                                served to continue on under the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> Government or to see his Government
                                overthrown. This had to be—and it was—a Chilean decision by Chileans
                                and, in my view, we must accept it.</p>
                            <p>My impression is that those who made the decision to overthrow the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> Government did
                                so reluctantly and could not have found it more painful or
                                difficult. The Chilean armed forces have been among the most
                                competent, respected and democratic-minded of any military services
                                anywhere in the world. In observing what happened in Chile we must
                                keep in mind the terrible ordeal that the Chilean people have
                                suffered in recent months and how hopeless their future looked to
                                them under the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                                Government.</p>

                            <p>We had been receiving a steady stream of reports from a wide variety
                                of sources in Chile speculating about a possible coup. Indeed, as we
                                all know, an unsuccessful coup was attempted on June 29 and the
                                reports of possible new attempts increased in frequency in recent
                                weeks. We assessed these reports and concluded that there was indeed
                                such a possibility. However, Chile had moved to the brink of a coup

                                reshuffling of his Cabinet—had managed to draw back from the brink.
                                Therefore, reports prior to and up to the eve of September 11 were
                                evaluated in that light: there might or might not be a coup at any
                                time. We simply did not know.</p>
                            <p>I want to make it absolutely clear, however, that there was no
                                official direct contact of any kind with us by the organizers and
                                leaders of the coup, who have subsequently become the Government of
                                Chile. We did not learn of the coup itself until shortly after it
                                began early Tuesday morning, September 11.</p>

                                last week. If I am not mistaken, the press reports were based upon a

                                it was held in the context of regular meetings by Government

                                discuss world affairs. The previous day’s developments in Chile were
                                naturally discussed during the course of the luncheon, but no

                                to cooperate with it because of the very important interests the

                            <p>The reality is that there has been a coup in Chile and that there is

                                healthy situation. Obviously, it will be well beyond the resources
                                of the United States alone to provide for all of the needs of Chile,
                                but I would hope that it will be possible for us to help in the

                                annual <gloss target="#t_UNITAS_1">UNITAS</gloss> exercise was
                                agreed to by the participating navies about a year ago. Our vessels
                                (3 destroyers, 1 submarine) left their anchorage at a Peruvian port
                                on Tuesday morning, September 11, to proceed with the scheduled next
                                phase of the exercise scheduled with the Chilean Navy. After our
                                vessels sailed, we learned that a coup had been initiated in Chile.
                                Our vessels were then instructed to interrupt their schedule and
                                they subsequently turned north in order to avoid giving any credence
                                to the possible charge of involvement.</p>
                            <p>FYI: We still don’t have confirmed information whether the Chilean
                                Navy actually left Valparaiso the night before the coup and then
                                returned. If true, it’s difficult to see what advantage could be

                        <p>(1) The overriding cause of Chile’s economic plight was its own misguided

                            Billion direct or guaranteed debts.</p>
                        <p>(3) Multilateral banks continued disbursements on existing loans to Chile
                            throughout the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>
                            period—with average annual disbursements <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>(4) Multilateral banks—like the Inter-American Development Bank and the
                            World Bank—are independent institutions with expert staffs of wide
                            experience. They are not controlled by the U.S., but make their own
                            independent judgments. (I would cite especially the statement made by
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRS_1">Bob McNamara</persName> of the World

                            Responses” paper.)</p>
                        <p>(5) On the question of military credits, two things stand out: (a) the
                            requests were made by the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"

                            military forces themselves; and (b) Chile had paid its military debts in
                            contrast with its sad performance on government and bank credits.</p>

                            loans was to a great extent determined by the will of Congress itself as

                            <p>Question: Did U.S. wage economic warfare against Chile and cause
                                downfall?</p>
                            <p>Answer: No. Chile’s economic plight was caused by their own misguided
                                economic policies. The facts amply support that as does objective
                                international opinion.</p>
                            <p>The posture of <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> was correct in
                                every sense of the word in its economic relations with Chile, and I
                                might even say, benign in view of the actions they took in
                                expropriating without compensation over $800 million of U.S. private
                                assets and in defaulting on over $1 billion worth of <gloss
                                    target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> direct or guaranteed debt. Here
                                are the facts:</p>
                            <p>1. No embargoes (unlike Cuba) on trade with Chile were carried out.
                                In fact, U.S. firms continued to supply spare parts and equipment as
                                long as the country’s economic management and credit rating merited.
                                Cash sales continued. No overt or covert pressure or restrictions
                                were put on U.S. firms or their subsidies abroad by <gloss
                                    target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>2. Private U.S. copper firms whose assets had been seized in Chile
                                pursued their international legal right by court actions abroad (in
                                France and Germany).</p>
                            <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> continued to disburse
                                normally on the small remaining bilateral aid loans after Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> came to
                                power.</p>
                            <p>Characteristic of most Marxist governments, there was no evidence of
                                a desire on their part to ask for bilateral aid from us. Under laws
                                of our country (<persName corresp="#p_HBB_1">Hickenlooper</persName>
                                Amendment) it would not have been legal for us to make new bilateral
                                loans—even had they expressed an interest.</p>
                            <p>The 100 percent default on Chilean debts to U.S. since November 1971,
                                representing not having to pay about $250 million, was, of course,
                                equivalent to making a new loan to them of like amount.</p>
                            <p>4. Multilateral banks continued to disburse during entire period on
                                existing loans to Chile—totaling $83M during the August 1971 to
                                August 1973 period. This represented an increase in average annual
                                disbursements as compared with the three years prior to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s coming to power.</p>
                            <pb n="772" facs="0812" xml:id="pg_772"/>
                            <p>The World Bank made no new loans to Chile—in line with its stated
                                policies of (a) not loaning to countries who are in default on their
                                international debt, (b) who have expropriated and not compensated
                                assets of private firms, or (c) who don’t meet normal economic
                                policy criteria. Chile failed on all three counts. I would refer you
                                to a speech by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRS_1">McNamara</persName>,
                                the President of the World Bank—never known as one who is the
                                implementor of U.S. policies—answering the Chilean charge that no
                                World Bank loans were made to Chile for political reasons. As he
                                explained, the absence of credit was due purely and simply to the
                                disastrous economic policies which the country was following.</p>
                            <p>This same objective analysis and conclusion was repeated this year,
                                when professional International Monetary Fund Staff, after an
                                in-depth analysis, reported on the deplorable state of the economy
                                and the need for sensible policies. The Fund has never been known as
                                a particularly American-biased institution.</p>
                            <p>The creditor countries who make up the Paris Group—including
                                countries most sympathetic to the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> Government, such as the French, Germans,
                                Danes, Spanish and Italians concluded in April of 1972 and again in
                                July of 1973 that there was little they could do to help Chile
                                unless it would adopt sensible policies. I will provide subsequently
                                some facts and figures for your records on the extent and nature of
                                their economic policies—but let me return to some other points
                                first.</p>
                            <p>(a) Illustrative of our giving the benefit of the doubt to Chile were
                                the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> favorable votes on two
                                Inter-American Bank loans to Chile of over $10 million in January of
                                1972—more than two months after accession of President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> and after nationalization
                                of the copper companies had been announced.</p>
                            <p>(b) New Eximbank loans were withheld for economic reasons, not
                                political. Chile was and is still in default on all their Eximbank
                                debt. For 18 months discussions on this debt have gone on
                                multilaterally in the Paris Club and bilaterally without any
                                payments having been made—again with some considerable restraint on
                                U.S.’s side. This, of course, is why the request for Exim loans for
                                the purchase of Boeing aircraft was turned down in 1971.</p>
                            <p>(c) Minor military loans of about $12 million were made to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>’s government to keep the
                                minimum level of equipment going and maintained. It could be likened
                                to our continuing disbursement on existing <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                    >AID</gloss>, and Eximbank loans for past projects, as well as
                                our decision to approve the two mentioned Inter-American Bank loans.
                                We were trying to keep the signals positive and the door open.</p>
                            <p>(d) In 1971/3 period the International Monetary Fund made the
                                equivalent of two separate loans (drawings) to Chile totaling $86
                                    mil<pb n="773" facs="0813" xml:id="pg_773"/>lion to make up
                                shortfalls in export earnings. The U.S. took no action to oppose or
                                otherwise make these drawings difficult.</p>
                            <p>Thus the answer to the question: did the U.S. cut off their credit in
                                international agencies is demonstrable NO. Where new credit flows
                                ceased, it was due to the rules and policies of the institutions
                                themselves and to Chile’s own economic action.</p>
                            <p>(e) Private credit from industrial countries did dry up over time.
                                This again was a function of a response to Chilean economic policies
                                and actions rather than some plot. U.S. and European banks postponed
                                payment of 70 percent of Chile’s debt payment falling due in
                                1972—worth about $128 million, which is the same as having given her
                                new money.</p>
                            <p>What I can say unequivocally—what President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> said earlier regarding our
                                relations with Chile—is that we were prepared to have the kind of
                                relations that Chile wanted. A consistently open-handed policy was
                                followed. In fact, some consider that we were soft on Chile, as I am
                                sure you will recall from the testimony given earlier this year
                                before the Church Subcommittee.</p>
                            <p>The truth of the matter is we did not want to drive the <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> Government into an
                                opposing camp or to an extremist position. We hoped they would be
                                reasonable and pragmatic. It would have made little sense in this
                                era of détente to have done otherwise. The fact remains that for
                                their own domestic political reasons the Government of Chile showed
                                little or no inclination to have good relations with us and, in
                                fact, did use international forums to attack us continuously—to
                                which we responded with restraint.</p>
                            <p>In sum, I believe no one can assert that this Government—the
                                Administration of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                    >Nixon</persName>—did anything directly or indirectly to bring
                                down the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> regime.
                                Quite to the contrary, I believe we bent over backward to show
                                patience and restraint in word and deed in the face of their
                                economic and public attacks. The Chilean revolution was a revolution
                                of the middle class—of doctors, housewives, airplane pilots,
                                truckers and the like. It was to support these people and to save
                                Chile from economic chaos that the military government intervened.
                                It was done after many months of trying to work as part of the

                                    >Allende</persName> Government, including the Inter-American
                                Development Bank, the World Bank, and private U.S. banking
                                institutions.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="italic">Response:</hi> This is patently false. The
                                international institutions cited are independent bodies which have
                                their own lending criteria and have sufficient experience in this
                                field to formulate their own judgments.</p>
                            <p>Private banks and other private U.S. entities are entirely free to
                                make decisions as they perceive in their self-interest. Some private
                                bank lending has continued, although it is true that the amounts
                                have dropped sharply. We assume this is because private banks have
                                been as concerned as others about Chile’s lack of
                                creditworthiness.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="italic">Allegation:</hi> Ex-Im Bank refused the loan

                                arbitrarily ended further lending.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="italic">Response:</hi> Regarding the aircraft case, there
                                was no refusal. The Ex-Im was perfectly prepared to continue
                                discussions on the loan request.</p>
                            <p>Ex-Im did ask for information on Chile’s economic policies pertinent
                                to the Bank’s responsibilities, since assurance of repayment is
                                fundamental. This normal precaution by Ex-Im was fully justified
                                when, less than three months later, the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> Government unilaterally declared a
                                moratorium on its existing debt schedule, effective November 12,
                                1971. Chile has been in default to Ex-Im ever since. In accordance
                                with its normal practice, Ex-Im extended no further loans or
                                insurance and guarantee coverage after Chile defaulted.
                                Disbursements were also suspended then, for the same reason. I
                                emphasize the sequence of dates. It is totally false to state that
                                Ex-Im informed Chile in August 1971 that disbursements would be
                                terminated.</p>
                            <p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Response:</hi> We have said many times that the
                                international lending institutions are responsible organizations,
                                staffed by experienced, skilled and responsible experts in their
                                field. They know their business <pb n="775" facs="0815"
                                    xml:id="pg_775"/>and we have every confidence that their
                                decisions are based entirely on such considerations as
                                creditworthiness and economic performance.</p>
                            <p>I should like to clarify the repeated misstatements on this subject
                                by quoting a statement made by the President of the World Bank on
                                October 18, 1972. I quote: “The primary condition for bank lending—a
                                soundly managed economy with a clear potential for utilizing
                                additional funds efficiently has not been met. The Chilean economy
                                is in severe difficulty . . . in this situation it is clear that
                                internal measures to reestablish reasonable economic stability are
                                required—and no amount of external financial assistance can
                                substitute for them. As matters stand—in the absence of such
                                fundamental economic stability—it is simply impossible for Bank
                                funds to be used productively for the benefit of the Chilean people,
                                and with the reasonable probability of repayment, which the Bank’s
                                Articles of Agreement require.”</p>
                            <p>I think it also important to note that during the entire period of
                                the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName> Government no
                                Chilean loan applications were presented to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_IBRD_1">IBRD</gloss> Board, therefore, it is absurd
                                to speak of “U.S. veto”. Regarding the Inter-American Bank, two
                                Chilean applications for loans came to a vote early in 1971 when
                                economic conditions were much healthier. At that time, the U.S.
                                voted for these loans. It is totally false to say that the U.S.
                                blocked a Chilean loan application for the development of a
                                petro-chemical industry. This project has not come before the Board
                                for a vote and has been under study by the Bank’s technicians.</p>

                                office in November 1970. Only one loan was signed after October 1968
                                and that was a $2.5 million Human Resources loan which was signed in
                                April 1970. After President <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                    >Allende</persName> took office, we continued disbursements on
                                existing A.I.D. loans and Chile did not request any new loans.</p>
                            <p>It could hardly be expected that the U.S. would extend new

                                had requested them, after Chile stopped servicing existing loans
                                beginning November 1971. Nonetheless, in <pb n="776" facs="0816"

                                certain A.I.D. loans, the U.S. waived legislative provisions which
                                would have cut off existing U.S. grant assistance programs. It is
                                frequently overlooked that there are ongoing U.S. assistance
                                programs in Chile. These include a P.L. 480 grant program for food

                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic Facts</p>
                            <p>1. At time of accession of new government in November 1970, the
                                Chileans had a historic net foreign exchange position of $343
                                million. The net foreign exchange position now is estimated at
                                negative $450 million.</p>
                            <p>2. The preceding government laid the groundwork for a stable economic
                                expansion, particularly in the copper sector. A purchase favorable
                                to Chile of 51% of U.S. companies share at book value or less had
                                taken place with 12 year repayment terms. Payment would come from
                                the government’s share of company profits, so in effect it cost them
                                nothing. In addition, an expansion plan was agreed to by the
                                companies to double production.</p>
                            <p>3. In spite of the doubling of physical capacity by the companies as
                                a result of the above decision, production has never come close to
                                capacity because of mismanagement. The professional cadres in the
                                mines, particularly engineers and supervisors, left the country.</p>
                            <p>4. Copper which was worth 45¢ to 50¢ per pound has increased to over
                                80¢ today. Under normal economic management, each cent increase
                                should have meant $20 million in new exports to Chile.</p>
                            <p>5. The money supply was increased 150% in 1972 and is estimated to
                                rise more than 400% in 1973. A fiscal deficit as a percentage of
                                total revenues increased from 14 percent in 1970 to over 80 percent
                                in 1972. Naturally, inflation was rampant—reaching from around 163%
                                in 1971 and 350 or more in 1973.</p>
                            <pb n="777" facs="0817" xml:id="pg_777"/>
                            <p>6. For a good part of the first year—while Chile was living beyond
                                its means, some felt better off. Once the reserves had run out,
                                investment declined and the inflation had caught up with everyone,
                                it was clear even to workers that they were worse off.</p>

                                New Communist country credits of more than $100 million were

                                International Monetary Fund. All of these resources, on top of
                                historically high reserves, were used up.</p>

                        <p>K: Frank, I just wanted to call you to tell you two things—one how much
                            your vote meant to me personally and secondly to reaffirm what I said to
                            the committee during the sessions of my really strong desire to
                            establish a new relationship with the committee—and of course with you
                            personally whom I’ve known for many years.</p>
                        <p>C: It’s awfully nice of you to do that Henry, I was glad to give you my
                            vote—you knew that and I look forward to working with you.</p>
                        <p>K: I know you must—it couldn’t have been easy in the total context of the
                            pressures in this country right now.</p>
                        <p>C: You were the most deserving man to be nominated as any I know and I’m
                            sure you are going to make a great secretary. And if we can reestablish
                            an effective working relationship between the State Dept and the
                            Committee, I think it would serve the country—</p>
                        <p>K: I feel very strongly—and anything I can do I will do, and if you have
                            any suggestions on how we might do it effectively, I’d be eager to hear
                            them.</p>
                        <p>C: Thank you Henry. I will take that as an opening wedge and I wish
                            that—I will follow them up. There’s one thing that’s been weighing
                            heavily on my mind and that’s the question of political asylum for these
                            large numbers of people that have been taken into custody in Chile and
                            it occurs to me—two things, first I understand there are or may be some
                            American citizens among them and I assume the State Dept is pursuing it
                            at the moment, the other thing is that the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1"
                                >OAS</gloss> as I recall has a council or commission that deals with
                            questions of political asylum—and I am wondering if we have done
                            anything to urge the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> to look into
                            this question on strictly humanitarian grounds.</p>
                        <pb n="780" facs="0820" xml:id="pg_780"/>
                        <p>K: I don’t think—in the last few days, I’ve not had the chance to follow
                            this as closely as I should—I don’t think we have, but I have a meeting
                            scheduled this afternoon—an interdepartmental meeting on Chile—and I
                            will raise this issue and if anything develops, I’ll call you first
                            thing in the morning.</p>
                        <p>C: That’d be fine. I appreciate it if you would. We’ve been—we’ve often
                            been the asylum you know for fascist exiles in this country—I don’t
                            propose we be an asylum for these Chileans, but I think there are other
                            countries like Mexico that might open up their gates for some of these
                            exiles and the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> would be the
                            appropriate instrument through which to work, it would seem to me.</p>
                        <p>K: Let me—first I’m very sympathetic to the asylum idea. I don’t know
                            what the best instrument is—I’d like to consult my colleagues, but you
                            can be certain that it will be high on the agenda this afternoon and
                            I’ll call you tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>C: Thank you Henry.</p>
                        <p>K: Goodbye.</p>

                                    Frank Mankiewicz called <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                        >Kissinger</persName> to discuss in more detail what was
                                    happening in Chile—in particular, regarding the emerging human
                                    rights crisis—and what the United States might do to improve the
                                    situation.</p>

                        <p>M: Henry.</p>
                        <p>K: Frank, how are you?</p>
                        <p>M: I’m fine. I have to . . . I was talking to Frank Touch [Church] this
                            morning and he told me you might be having some kind of discussions
                            about Chile this afternoon.</p>
                        <pb n="781" facs="0821" xml:id="pg_781"/>
                        <p>K: That’s right.</p>
                        <p>M: And I thought if I could I would take about a minute and a half and
                            give you a couple of notions which may or may not work. I don’t know
                            what attitudes are but it seems to me that with foreign correspondents
                            in there now we are going to start to get I think a fair amount of
                            rather unpleasant reporting because all of the reports I get are that
                            these are not very nice people and very insecure. And that there are
                            probably a lot more people dead and there may be you know torture going
                            on and people being held in the stadiums and that all has a bad ring.
                            It’s not your kind of classic Latin American coup by any means and from
                            the fact that they’re making up all kinds of stories. Maybe they are all
                            true but it’s hard to believe that these people were simultaneously
                            stashing Russian arms and planning assassination plots and stealing all
                            the money. I mean that has all the ring of insecurity that those stories
                            are coming out of the junta. I think that regardless of what kind of
                            face the U.S. is going to put toward this at a very minimum we could be
                            talking about human rights you know. About asylum and respecting asylum
                            and after all the courts are working. There is no reason to have
                            military trials of civilians make that kind of representation, because,
                            I’ll send you the excerpts from the newspapers that are being printed
                            and statements that were made in the week or so prior to the coup. They
                            talk about an Indonesian solution which is most ominous. And I also got
                            this 2 days ago. Something somebody sent me a full week before the coup,
                            which was an editorial in the Christian Democratic paper. The party
                            paper. A most straight anti-semitic editorial including last names of
                            the suffixes of names of people we must now go after. This editorial
                            says, “the Soviet Union is an anti-Jewish dictatorship and Chile is
                            pro-Jewish Communist dictatorship.” I just can’t believe that more than
                            9 Jews in the whole country.</p>
                        <p>K: I was just going to say.</p>
                        <p>M: I don’t think its Jews they’re after but it indicates a state of mind
                            that I think is most un-Latin.</p>
                        <p>K: Yeah. That is amazing.</p>
                        <p>M: I assume we have people down there now but as I say I would guess that
                            by tonight, tomorrow morning, the next day, the foreign journalists are
                            going to put quite a different face on it. You’re not going to have
                            foreign journalists being arrested.</p>
                        <p>K: Well, you know, I told Frank that this was something that we were
                            discussing this afternoon but really, only in a sort of a fact finding
                            way. I’m not in a good position until I’m confirmed and sworn in really
                            to take a reading roll but I did tell Frank that I would raise the
                            asylum issue.</p>
                        <p>M: Yeah, you see there is a U.N., there’s a <gloss target="#t_OAS_1"
                                >OAS</gloss> rights commission and unlike anything connected with
                                <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> he has done some good work <pb
                                n="782" facs="0822" xml:id="pg_782"/>in the past. Almost in spite of
                            himself and has some respect down there. I think it would be very
                            difficult for these people to refuse to let it in. The civilians even
                            are trying not to let them come in and investigate allegations of
                            torture a couple of years ago and we’re not on it which is even better.
                            I think 5 members and kind of a distinguished jurist____ and I would
                            think anything that could promote their coming in or sending a
                            representative in would be very effective.</p>
                        <p>K: Let me . . . this is a point about which perhaps I can do something
                            this afternoon but don’t expect it.</p>
                        <p>M: I realize you’re in a very difficult position.</p>
                        <p>K: I’m going to look into it.</p>
                        <p>M: When do you think confirmation is coming?</p>
                        <p>K: I think they are voting tomorrow morning. I think there is unanimous
                            consent now to vote tomorrow morning.</p>
                        <p>M: Well that’s fine.</p>
                        <p>K: And then I’ll be sworn in Saturday but next week I’ll have to spend
                            three days at the U.N.</p>
                        <p>M: Seeing the new members.</p>
                        <p>K: Well, I’ve got to deliver the speech and . . . for the U.S. It gives
                            me a chance perhaps to say something a little more thoughtful than has
                            been said in recent years though I have hardly the time to prepare
                            something.</p>
                        <p>M: Well, I think it is a good opportunity. Don’t let them ask you
                            questions afterward. That’s my advice to you but you know major foreign
                            policy speakers do not accept questions. Do you think the White House
                            wants Agnew to resign and then you’ll say I have no comment and then
                            that’s the story.</p>
                        <p>K: I’ll bet that’s right.</p>
                        <p>M: So just keep your counsel.</p>
                        <p>K: No, I’ll say I couldn’t be interested in it since I’m ineligible.</p>
                        <p>M: That’s right, constitutionally ineligible. I think you’ll do fine up
                            there. So it’s tomorrow. That’s good.</p>
                        <p>K: I hope so.</p>
                        <p>M: And then you’ll be sworn in Saturday.</p>
                        <p>K: That’s what it looks like.</p>
                        <p>M: OK.</p>
                        <p>K: Many thanks.</p>
                        <p>M: I’m just passing this on because you know when ever anything happens .
                            . .</p>
                        <p>K: That’s what I want you to do Frank.</p>
                        <p>M: 10 or 15 people call me up every hour.</p>
                        <pb n="783" facs="0823" xml:id="pg_783"/>
                        <p>K: I want you to feel that I am a place you will try and call and should
                            call.</p>
                        <p>M: Normally I’ll do it by paper but you know this thing is moving fast
                            and I . . .</p>
                        <p>K: I enjoyed seeing you on Saturday.</p>
                        <p>M: Yeah, and we’ll set up a couple of dinners up here very soon. Holly
                            thinks that’s an excellent idea.</p>
                        <p>K: Good. McGovern also mentioned it when he called me the other day and
                            told me he was going to vote against me but . . .</p>
                        <p>M: Yeah, I thought that was a pretty good statement of his, all things
                            considered.</p>
                        <p>K: It was a good statement. No, he had his constituency to worry
                            about.</p>
                        <p>M: Sure.</p>
                        <p>K: I thought it was the minimum criticism he could make.</p>
                        <p>M: That’s right. That’s exactly my thought that he could have done a lot
                            more.</p>
                        <p>K: No I understood it very well and there were no bad feelings, not only
                            no bad feelings, I thought it laid the basis for good . . .</p>
                        <p>M: I had dinner with him last night and he told me that he had called you
                            and I said I thought, my feeling was that you would respect that
                            considerably. He said he thought you had. So I think that will be good.
                            Well, alright. If I get other things I’ll pass them along.</p>
                        <p>K: Good, wonderful. Bye.</p>

                            officers have seen detained Americans and what we are doing to assure
                            their welfare.</p>
                        <p>Imperative that consular officers gain access to detainees so spokesman
                            can say so. We note Junta representative told Embassy officer they
                            trying to improve their image in foreign press. Continued refusal to
                            allow access by consular officers to detainees runs counter to this

                        <p>187854. Subject: Transcript of State Dept. News Briefing, Thursday,
                            September 20.</p>
                        <p>The following are the pertinent remarks concerning Chile made by the
                            State Department spokesman at today’s noon briefing for your information
                            and possible use in answering questions:</p>
                        <p>Q: John, on Chile, how many Americans are being held by the Chile
                            Government and what is the U.S. doing about getting them out?</p>
                        <p>A: We have, from various sources, information about the Americans and
                            their condition at Chile. At the moment, it seems that perhaps as many
                            as six have been detained by the Junta. I have some of their names but,
                            in other cases, next of kin have not been notified, so we would withhold
                            that for the time being.</p>
                        <p>But, in any event, to answer the second part of your question, we’ve
                            instructed the Embassy to continue its efforts to communicate with all
                            American citizens who we would have reason to believe have been detained
                            or otherwise deflected from their original purposes.</p>
                        <p>We will do the usual—that is to say, ascertain their welfare—seek to
                            insure their human needs, if any—and, obviously be in contact with
                            Chilean authorities to insure that they receive fair and equitable
                            treatment.</p>
                        <p>Q: Why are they being held, John?</p>
                        <p>A: We don’t know yet. As I say, we don’t have all the facts.</p>
                        <p>Q: Are any of the six American officials—of any agency?</p>
                        <p>A: No, they’re not officials. There are a couple of Maryknoll missionary
                            priests: Joseph Dougherty, and Francis Flynn.</p>
                        <p>Q: Has there been any contact between the Embassy and these detainees to
                            this point?</p>
                        <pb n="786" facs="0826" xml:id="pg_786"/>
                        <p>A: I’m pretty sure with some of them, but I just can’t catalog it for
                            you. Let me give you the other names I have: Adam Schesch, and his wife
                            Patricia.</p>
                        <p>Q: Who are they, do you know?</p>
                        <p>A: American citizens. That’s really the only way to characterize them
                            now. And the last two names are: Carol Nesso—and—David Cusack. I’m
                            sorry. That’s all the information.</p>
                        <p>Q: Do you have occupations for the two last ones, John?</p>
                        <p>A: No.</p>
                        <p>Q: John, you don’t have any information that Adam Schesch and David
                            Cusack are American professors who were under contract to an American
                            agency working in—</p>
                        <p>A: They could well be. I did see reference in at least one story this
                            morning that the Schesch’s were connected with an American university.
                            But I can’t confirm that; I don’t know it yet.</p>
                        <p>We may well have the information. It just hasn’t come in.</p>
                        <p>Q: American professors under contract to the United States Government,
                            working in Chile?</p>
                        <p>A: It could well be. I just don’t know.</p>
                        <p>Q: Do your previous sources say anything about the sort of treatment that
                            these and other people are receiving?</p>
                        <p>A: Well, I guess I’m left in the unsatisfactory position of just saying
                            that we don’t have any firm information which would substantiate these
                            charges which we’ve seen in several reports, but—</p>
                        <p>Q: What charges?</p>
                        <p>A: About repressive measures used against people who have been detained
                            in Chile. I can assure you that the Embassy will do everything it can to
                            perform the usual functions on behalf of American citizens who may be in
                            need of assistance.</p>
                        <p>Q: We have not been given access to them though. We have not been denied
                            that privilege?</p>
                        <p>A: This came up in a different form earlier. I just don’t know. I can’t
                            speak to all of them. We know they’re there, and we’ve been in touch
                            either with them or with the appropriate authorities.</p>
                        <p>Q: John, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1">Allende</persName>, in an
                            interview in the “Times” today, suggested that the U.S. Government might
                            have helped foment the coup by paying off the striking transportation
                            workers. Do you have any comment on that?</p>
                        <p>A: I’m not sure exactly what Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> said, but let me repeat that the United States
                            Government—and I speak for all elements of the Government—were not
                            involved in the Chilean coup. We’ve said this repeatedly; I will say it
                            again in answer to that.</p>
                        <pb n="787" facs="0827" xml:id="pg_787"/>
                        <p>Q: You recognize my question is different from that, do you?</p>
                        <p>A: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Q: Will you check into that? I mean it’s getting a lot of publicity.</p>
                        <p>A: I realize that.</p>
                        <p>Q: Will you look into that?</p>
                        <p>A: I will stand on what I just said: We were not involved—and I repeat
                            that.</p>
                        <p>Q: Then you’re not denying you might have paid off the transportation
                            workers.</p>
                        <p>A: Well, we were not involved in any way in that coup.</p>
                        <p>Q: John, are these people who are being detained—the Americans—charged,
                            or about to be charged, with anything?</p>
                        <p>A: We don’t know yet. We just don’t know.</p>
                        <p>Q: John, in your opinion, would the payment—if you made any to the
                            transport workers in Chile—constitute what Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> would have construed as an
                            “interference in the internal affairs of another country”? He made a
                            great issue of this at the confirmation hearings about internal
                            affairs.</p>
                        <p>A: Look, I have great trouble accepting this premise that “if we did
                            this” and that “if we did that.” I said—and I repeat—we were not
                            involved in any way in the overthrow of the <persName corresp="#p_AGS_1"
                                >Allende</persName> government.</p>
                        <p>Q: No. I realize, of course, that’s a theoretical question.</p>
                        <p>A: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Q: Not directly or indirectly involved—is that what you’re saying?</p>
                        <p>A: I said “in any way.”</p>
                        <p>Q: John, I realize that your remarks are directed about the coup, but it
                            still does not get down to the question about whether there was money
                            given to the transportation strikers. Could you address yourself
                            specifically to that question and not to the coup itself?</p>
                        <p>A: I see; yes.</p>
                        <p>Let me look into that. (Note: See end of cable.)</p>
                        <p>Q: Including the possibility that there may have been humanitarian
                            assistance?</p>
                        <p>A: Well, we’re including all possibilities. That’s why I want to be as
                            careful as possible about this matter.</p>
                        <p>Q: John, do you know if these Americans are being held in the sports
                            stadium, or where?</p>
                        <p>A: I don’t have their locale at hand. I can try to find that out for you.
                            I assume they’re in one of the two sports stadiums, which apparently are
                            being used for detention purposes.</p>
                        <pb n="788" facs="0828" xml:id="pg_788"/>
                        <p>Q: John I’m a little bit surprised at you. You had no answer to the
                            question whether there was any contact between the Embassy and the
                            detained people.</p>
                        <p>A: Yes. I assume there has been, but I don’t know whether they’ve seen
                            them all. As I said, the information that they are detained has come to
                            us from various sources; and I just can’t be categoric about it. But, in
                            any event, we will make every appropriate effort to do what is needed to
                            assist these people.</p>
                        <p>Q: John, could I turn that question around? Has the Chilean Government
                            offered any obstacles to American requests to see the six?</p>
                        <p>A: That’s hard to say. It’s a pretty confused situation. You know how you
                            can run into anomalous situations. When I tell you that, I don’t want
                            you to think that we’re having trouble.</p>
                        <p>The one case I do know about, where we were informed that the American
                            had a problem, that the Embassy moved immediately, was in contact with
                            the authorities—the person was released within hours, and everything
                            seems to be all right.</p>
                        <p>Q: John, it’s correct though that you have made representations to the
                            new government on behalf of the six?</p>
                        <p>A: Well, no. We always like to be sure of our facts first. And before we
                            get to that stage, you want to know exactly what they’re charged with or
                            why they’re being held, and that sort of thing.</p>
                        <p>Q: Well, we have gone that far. We have asked the Chileans for the facts
                            surrounding the individuals?</p>
                        <p>A: Yes. You can assume that we’re doing that. Yes.</p>
                        <p>Q: John, how many of the Americans who were held, who were detained, have
                            now been released?</p>
                        <p>A: I know of a couple of cases. I can’t be more specific than that. And
                            the material we pulled together here just doesn’t address itself to that
                            question. But you know that the swimmers were having a problem there.
                            They arrived in Miami this morning.</p>
                        <p>Q: How many?</p>
                        <p>A: Half a dozen or so.</p>
                        <p>Q: Can you apply that statement of the “no American involvement in the
                            coup in any way” to the six?</p>
                        <p>A: To the six?</p>
                        <p>Q: To the six who were being detained?</p>
                        <p>Q: In Santiago?</p>
                        <p>A: Yes. As far as I know, these were private citizens. I’m speaking about
                            government involvement—the allegations of government involvement.</p>
                        <pb n="789" facs="0829" xml:id="pg_789"/>
                        <p>I just can’t be blanket and categoric about a matter involving
                            individuals.</p>
                        <p>Q: But you did say, John, that a couple of Americans were released; is
                            this true?</p>
                        <p>A: Yes. To my knowledge, yes.</p>
                        <p>Q: Then you’re not ruling out the possibility that some private business
                            interests may have been involved in the coup? You’re only denying from a
                            government standpoint.</p>
                        <p>A: No change; surely. I wouldn’t presume to speak for anybody else.</p>
                        <p>Q: I ask: Do you rule out the possibility?</p>
                        <p>A: I wouldn’t even accept the question. I speak only for the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>Q: But you said you spoke for all agencies of the U.S. Government.</p>
                        <p>A: For the United States Government, lest there be any misapprehensions
                            here.</p>
                        <p>Q: Could I just finish up one question on Chile, please?</p>
                        <p>I’m just puzzled by your wording. You said “as many as six have been
                            detained.” Does that mean that you know there are no more and that some
                            of these may be released by now?</p>
                        <p>A: I guess we calculate that at the time of the coup there may have been
                            as many as several thousand Americans in Santiago or environs; and, you
                            know, who knows what problems some of these people have?</p>
                        <p>Well, for instance—for days you couldn’t get an airplane out of Chile.
                            And I just can’t be categoric about all the Americans.</p>
                        <p>Q: But you know there are no more than these six in detention.</p>
                        <p>A: We have no information that there are more; I have no information that
                            there are more.</p>
                        <p>What I’m saying is that we’re dealing with a half dozen to a dozen people
                            here, as I understand it. Only six Americans that we know of were being
                            detained as of today.</p>
                        <p>Q: John, just for the purpose of this story, when was the last time the
                            Department was absolutely sure that these six people were still being
                            detained?</p>
                        <p>A: This morning.</p>
                        <p>End transcript.</p>
                        <p>Later in the afternoon the following statement was released by the

                            suggesting that the United States might have financed the truckers’
                            strike which preceded the coup in Chile. Such suggestions are <pb
                                n="790" facs="0830" xml:id="pg_790"/>absurd. The United States
                            played no part, financial or otherwise, in that strike or in the other

                        <p>1. Of nine persons reported currently detained or missing in last <gloss

                            confirmed by Chilean authorities—two Garrett-Schesches and two Maryknoll
                            priests, Flynn and Dougherty—all held at National Stadium. We have
                            assurances that two Garrett-Schesches will be released to Embassy at
                            1000 hours Sept. 21st. Of remaining five, two were seen by employers or
                            neighbors when detained. Other three reported missing by relatives or
                            friends and presumed detained. Chilean military authorities deny they
                            are held at National Stadium and have no further info. Embassy continues
                            to check other sources including hospitals to locate them.</p>

                            reported safe, eight personally reported circumstances of detention and
                            release to Embassy. Their time of detention varied from thirty minutes
                            to overnight. Consulate made inquiries in four of these cases—other four
                            were released before Embassy heard they detained. In the remaining other
                            five of these thirteen cases, all of which were eventually reported
                            safe, consulate had unconfirmed info on detentions and sought

                        <p>1. Re paragraphs 8 and 9 of <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>, I
                            regret that I must report that a request for ammunition has been
                            received since the flare and helmet request. The Chilean Air Force would
                            like to buy one million rounds of 7.62 mm <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> ammunition. They would like to do this as an <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> cash sale. The FACH would send
                            aircraft to pick up ammunition if made available, and would prefer Canal
                            Zone.</p>
                        <p>2. While we have not so far had any requests from Chilean Army and Navy,
                            as a realistic assessment, we must expect similar requests soon to be
                            forthcoming. In fact, the Army has already asked about hydraulic fluid
                            for artillery recoil mechanisms and the Navy is talking about 3000
                            rounds of 3″/50 projectiles for shipboard use.</p>
                        <p>3. In light of the foregoing, I shall not rpt not make any statement
                            about the continuance of previously planned and approved shipments of
                            military supplies to Chile until further instructed. I fully understand
                            the sensitivity of this problem and factors which would make it
                            immensely preferable if Chileans could turn to procurement from other
                            friendly countries. However, I am sure you also fully understand the
                            urgency of Chile’s needs and the importance the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1"
                                >GOC</gloss> does and will place on the willingness of the <gloss

                            considerable cost and risk. A decision to deny all such requests—even
                                <pb n="792" facs="0832" xml:id="pg_792"/>for a relatively short
                            period—would have extremely serious and long term consequences here in
                            our relations with Chilean military.</p>

                        <p>1. Of ten persons reported currently detained or missing in last <gloss
                                target="#t_sitrep_1">sitrep</gloss> (Santiago 4528), one (Abeid) has
                            been removed as not AmCit—determined to be Kuwaiti according to military
                            authorities at National Stadium. Four have been confirmed by Chilean
                            authorities as detained—the two Maryknoll priests, Dougherty and Flynn,
                            at the National Stadium; Fisk, at the Aviation School; and Nolasco, by
                            the Investigations Bureau. According to military authorities at the
                            National Stadium, the latter two had not yet arrived there—the normal
                            long-term detention locale—as of noon 23 Sept. Of the remaining five,
                            three (Nezzo, Ritter and Welsh) were seen by friends or neighbors to be
                            detained and taken away. The other two (<persName corresp="#p_HC_1"
                                >Horman</persName> and Wool) have been reported missing and are
                            assumed to be detained. Chilean authorities report no info on any of
                            these five. Embassy continues to check other sources including hospitals
                            to locate them.</p>
                        <p>2. Of the twenty additional persons reported in sitrepts to be missing or
                            detained, but then subsequently reported safe, twelve personally
                            reported circumstances of detention and release to Embassy. Consulate
                            made inquiries in eight of these cases. Four—two Garrett-Schesches,
                            Cerretti and Warlow—were released to consular officer. Four were
                            released on their own cognizance, and the other four were released
                            before Embassy heard they detained. Of the remaining eight of these
                            twenty cases, all of which were eventually reported safe, con<pb n="793"
