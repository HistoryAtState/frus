                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In July, 1900, when the antiforeign uprising
                        in China had cut the Government off from communication with our minister at
                        Peking, and it was deemed of great importance that the general condition of
                        affairs in that country should be promptly reported on and the bearing of
                        events on American interests exactly determined, the President was pleased
                        to appoint me commissioner of the United States to China.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0010"/>
                    <p>I reached Shanghai on the 29th of August and proceeded at once to Peking,
                        where I discussed with our minister, Mr. Conger, the situation and the steps
                        he proposed taking to hasten the restoration of order and for the protection
                        of American persons and property, and I was pleased to be able to report to
                        you that I fully concurred with him in all the measures he had been and was
                        advocating.</p>
                    <p>After a brief stay at Peking I returned to Shanghai and then visited the
                        Viceroy Liu K’un-yi at Nanking, and later the Viceroy Chang Chih-tung at
                        Wu-chang, for the purpose of thanking them, in the name of the United
                        States, for the perfect manner in which they and the other viceroys had
                        maintained peace, and the friendly spirit they and their provincial
                        administrations were showing foreigners during these troublesome times. I
                        wished also to ascertain their views on the question of the restoration of
                        order and the return of His Majesty the Emperor to Peking. The courteous and
                        friendly receptions given me by the two viceroys, and the personal relations
                        which I was thus so fortunate as to establish, and which were kept up during
                        the remainder of my mission in China, did not a little, I think, in the
                        interest of peace and the common benefit of the two countries.</p>
                    <p>After returning to Shanghai and conferring with the various American
                        commercial and missionary bodies there, I left again for Peking, where you
                        had directed me to proceed to act as counselor and adviser of the American
                        minister in the negotiations then begun. I discharged this duty, and, I am
                        pleased to say, always in perfect harmony with our minister, until the 23d
                        of February of this year, when Mr. Conger, having obtained from you leave of
                        absence with permission to visit the United States, I was appointed by the
                        President, under telegraphic instructions from you, plenipotentiary to
                        continue the negotiations on the part of the United States. In this capacity
                        I acted until September 7, when the Final Protocol, embodying the results of
                        the negotiations between the various powers and China, was signed. I then
                        left for the United States and arrived at Washington on October 23.</p>
                    <p>The different phases of the negotiations between the powers and China, which
                        extended over a period of about fourteen months, are shown in detail in the
                        correspondence of Mr. Conger and myself with the Department and also in the
                        printed minutes of the various meetings of the conference at Peking. With
                        these before you I shall not go over these questions again. I shall confine
                        myself to summarizing the work of the United States in the conference.</p>
                    <p>The circular note which you telegraphed on July 3, 1900, to our embassies in
                        Europe and to our missions in Vienna, Brussels, Madrid, Tokyo, The Hague,
                        and Lisbon defined the policy then already adopted by the United States in
                        the settlement of affairs in China and from which they never departed.
                        Bearing these instructions always in mind, the task of the agents of our
                        Government in Peking was a comparatively easy one. Throughout the
                        negotiations our object was to use the influence of our Government in the
                        interest of justice and moderation and in a spirit of equal friendship to
                        the powers negotiating jointly with us and the Chinese nation.</p>
                    <p>The twelve demands made by the powers on China, the accomplishment of which
                        was deemed necessary for the restoration of normal relations with that
                        country and which were embodied in the joint note of December 22, 1900, may
                        be classified under four principal heads: (1) Adequate punishment for the
                        authors of and those guilty of actual <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0011"
                        />participation in the antiforeign massacres and riots; (2) the adoption of
                        measures necessary to prevent their recurrence; (3) the indemnification for
                        losses sustained by States and foreigners through these riots; and (4) the
                        improvement of our relations, both official and commercial, with the Chinese
                        Government and with China generally.</p>
                    <p>As regards the punishment of the responsible authors and actual perpetrators
                        of the antiforeign outrages, the Government of the United States, while
                        insisting that all such should be held to the utmost accountability,
                        declined to determine in every case the nature of the punishment to be
                        inflicted, and maintained that the Chinese Government itself should in all
                        cases carry them out.</p>
                    <p>As soon as the chief culprits had been punished, considering the terrible
                        losses in life and property sustained by China, not only through the Boxers
                        and their adherents, but by the destruction of Tientsin, Peking, and the
                        military occupation of a large portion of the Province of Chih-li, the
                        United States threw the weight of its influence on the side of moderation
                        and the prevention of further bloodshed. To this it was mainly due that the
                        long lists of proscription, which had been prepared by the representatives
                        of the powers, of Chinese in the provinces charged with participation in the
                        massacres or riots, were repeatedly revised before presentation to the
                        Chinese Government. The demands for capital punishment were finally reduced
                        from ten to four and many names erroneously or on insufficient evidence
                        placed on the lists were removed, or lighter forms of punishment asked for
                        numbers of those left on them.</p>
                    <p>While seeking with the other powers the best means to prevent the recurrence
                        of such troubles and to guard the future American residents in Peking from
                        such dangers as they had passed through, the United States did not lend its
                        support to any plan which contemplated either the prolonged occupation by
                        foreign troops of any portions or points in China or the erection of an
                        international fort in the city of Peking from which to carry on friendly
                        relations with the Chinese Government. Our policy has always been in favor
                        of a strong, independent, and responsible Chinese Government, which can and
                        will be held accountable for the maintenance of order and the protection of
                        our citizens and their rights under the treaties. Throughout the
                        negotiations we strictly adhered to this just principle, with results which
                        have proved beneficial to all.</p>
                    <p>As regards the third point of the negotiations, the equitable indemnification
                        of the various states for the losses and expenses incurred by them in China
                        and in sending expeditionary forces to relieve the legations and foreign
                        residents at Peking and restore order, and also the securing of indemnities
                        to societies, companies, and individuals for their private losses through
                        the antiforeign riots, the Government of the United States advocated that
                        the sum total of these indemnities should not exceed a reasonable amount,
                        well within the power of China to pay. After careful inquiry you reached the
                        conclusion that with her present resources and liabilities, China could not
                        pay as indemnities to the powers more than two hundred millions of dollars,
                        and that the exaction of any larger amount would not only entail permanent
                        financial embarrassment on the country, but might possibly result in either
                        international financial control or even loss of territory. The
                        representative of the United States was instructed accordingly, and he was
                        further told that in the opinion of our Government the amount <pb n="6"
                            xml:id="pg_6" facs="0012"/>should be asked of China by the powers
                        jointly, without detail or explanation, and afterwards divided among them,
                        according to their losses and disbursements. You also stated that every
                        facility of payment should be accorded China, and that the debt should be
                        paid by bonds issued at par and bearing 3 per cent interest and running for
                        thirty or forty years.</p>
                    <p>Though it became necessary, after protracted discussion in the conference, to
                        accept the proposition of the other powers to demand of China the sum total
                        of their losses and disbursements, reaching the enormous sum of
                        $333,000,000, our insistance in pressing for a much lower sum, and the
                        weight of the arguments adduced in favor of such a policy, resulted in
                        closing the indemnities at the above lump sum, when they bid fair to go on
                        swelling indefinitely. This, and the acceptance of your suggestion that the
                        indemnities be paid in bonds issued at par and bearing a low rate of
                        interest (4 per cent was finally agreed upon) and running for forty years,
                        resulted in saving a vast sum to China, hastened the evacuation of the
                        country by the expeditionary forces and the restoration of order and of
                        normal relations with the Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the question of the indemnity, I should particularly
                        mention that, it having been proved necessary to the powers in their search
                        for revenues applicable to the service of the indemnity debt that the
                        existing nominal 5 per cent ad valorem customs tariff on foreign imports
                        should be made an effective 5 per cent ad valorem, the United States,
                        mindful of the furtherance of lawful commerce in China in the interests of
                        the world, and believing that no opportunity should be lost to secure to
                        foreign trade all the facilities its vast importance entitles it to, and
                        that any additional tax on trade should be met by commercial compensations
                        on the part of China of equal value, declined to consent to the above
                        increase of the customs tariff on imports unless (1) all the treaty powers
                        and China agreed to cooperate in the long desired improvement of the water
                        approaches to Shanghai and Tientsin, and (2) that specific duties should be
                        substituted to the present ad valorem ones in the tariff on foreign imports.
                        Both of these conditions were ultimately agreed upon.</p>
                    <p>No divergence of views existed fortunately between the representatives the
                        powers on the question of improving the channels of direct communication
                        between them and the Chinese Government. The long vexed question of the
                        ceremonial to be observed in the public audiences granted by the Emperor of
                        China to foreign representatives was finally settled by the
                        plenipotentiaries on lines perfectly satisfactory to all parties to the
                        negotiations. The Tsungli Yamen, or bureau of foreign affairs, which the
                        experience of forty years had shown Chinese and foreigners alike was
                        unwieldly and incapable of discharging the duties devolving upon it, was
                        altered in the way suggested by the conference, changed into a responsible
                        ministry of foreign affairs, and organized on lines similar to those adopted
                        in every other country of the world.</p>
                    <p>Such, in brief, has been the part played by the United States in the
                        conference of Peking. While we maintained complete independence, we were
                        able to act harmoniously in the concert or powers, the existence of which
                        was so essential to a prompt and peaceful settlement of the situation, we
                        retained the friendship of all the negotiating powers, exerted a salutary
                        influence in the cause of moderation, humanity, and justice, secured
                        adequate reparation for wrongs done our citizens, <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7"
                            facs="0013"/>guaranties for their future protection, and labored
                        successfully in the interests of the whole world in the cause of equal and
                        impartial trade with all parts of the Chinese Empire.</p>
                    <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        missions in Vienna, Brussels, Madrid, Tokyo, The Hague, and Lisbon.]</p>
                    <p>In this critical posture of affairs in China it is deemed appropriate to
                        define the attitude of the United States as far as present circumstances
                        permit this to be done. We adhere to the policy initiated by us in 1857 of
                        peace with the Chinese nation, of furtherance of lawful commerce, and of
                        protection of lives and property of our citizens by all means guaranteed
                        under extraterritorial treaty rights and by the law of nations. If wrong be
                        done to our citizens we propose to hold the responsible authors to the
                        uttermost accountability. We regard the condition at Pekin as one of virtual
                        anarchy, whereby power and responsibility are practically devolved upon the
                        local provincial authorities. So long as they are not in overt collusion
                        with rebellion and use their power to protect foreign life and property, we
                        regard them as representing the Chinese people, with whom we seek to remain
                        in peace and friendship. The purpose of the President is, as it has been
                        heretofore, to act concurrently with the other powers; first, in opening up
                        communication with Pekin and rescuing the American officials, missionaries,
                        and other Americans who are in danger; secondly, in affording all possible
                        protection everywhere in China to American life and property; thirdly, in
                        guarding and protecting all legitimate American interests; and fourthly, in
                        aiding to prevent a spread of the disorders to the other provinces of the
                        Empire and a recurrence of such disasters. It is of course too early to
                        forecast the means of attaining this last result; but the policy of the
                        Government of the United States is to seek a solution which may bring about
                        permanent safety and peace to China, preserve Chinese territorial and
                        administrative entity, protect all rights guaranteed to friendly powers by
                        treaty and international law, and safeguard for the world the principle of
                        equal and impartial trade with all parts of the Chinese Empire.</p>

                        transmit it to your excellency. The Imperial message is respectfully
                        transmitted, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    Excellency the President of the United States,
                                greeting:</hi></p>
                            <p>China has long maintained friendly relations with the United States
                                and is deeply conscious that the object of the United States is
                                international commerce. Neither country entertains the least
                                suspicion or distrust toward the other. Recent outbreaks of mutual
                                antipathy between the people and Christian missions caused the
                                foreign powers to view with unwarranted suspicion the position of
                                the Imperial Government as favorable to the people and predjudicial
                                to the missions, with the result that the Taku forts were attacked
                                and captured. Consequently there has been clashing of forces with
                                calamitous consequences. The situation has become more and more
                                serious and critical. We have just received a telegraphic memorial
                                from our envoy, Wu Tingfang, and it is highly gratifying to us to
                                learn that the United States Government, having in view the friendly
                                relations between the two countries, has taken a deep interest in
                                the present situation. Now China, driven by the irresistible course
                                of events, has unfortunately incurred well-nigh universal
                                indignation. For settling the present difficulty, China places
                                special reliance in the United States. We address this message to
                                your excellency in all sincerity and candidness, with the hope that
                                your excellency will devise measures and take the initiative in
                                bringing about a concert of the powers for the restoration of order
                                and peace. The favor of a kind reply is earnestly requested and
                                awaited with the greatest anxiety.</p>

                    <p>I have received Your Majesty’s message of the 19th of July, and am glad to
                        know that Your Majesty recognizes the fact that the Government and people of
                        the United States desire of China nothing but what is just and equitable.
                        The purpose for which we landed troops in China was the rescue of our
                        legation from grave danger and the protection of the lives and property of
                        Americans who were sojourning in China in the enjoyment of rights guaranteed
                        them by treaty and by international law. The same purposes are publicly
                        declared by all the powers which have landed military forces in Your
                        Majesty’s Empire.</p>
                    <p>I am to infer from Your Majesty’s letter that the malefactors who have
                        disturbed the peace of China, who have murdered the minister of Germany and
                        a member of the Japanese legation, and who now hold besieged in Pekin those
                        foreign diplomatists who still survive, have not only not received any favor
                        or encouragement from Your Majesty, but are actually in rebellion against
                        the Imperial authority. If this be the case, I most solemnly urge upon Your
                        Majesty’s Government to give public assurance whether the foreign ministers
                        are alive, and if so, in what condition.</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>To put the diplomatic representatives of the powers in immediate and
                            free communication with their respective Governments and to remove all
                            danger to their lives and liberty.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>To place the Imperial authorities of China in communication with the

                            order.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>If these objects are accomplished it is the belief of this Government that no
                        obstacles will be found to exist on the part of the powers to an amicable
                        settlement of all the questions arising out of the recent troubles, and the
                        friendly good offices of this Government will, with the assent of the other

                            <p>In the present conflict between Chinese and foreigners there has been

                    <p>It is evident that there can be no general negotiation between China and the

                        that the powers can not cease their efforts for the delivery of these
                        representatives, to which they are constrained by the highest considerations

                        confer with Secretary of State upon subject of withdrawal of troops and
                        appointment of plenipotentiary to negotiate settlement of all other
                        questions so as to preserve amicable relations. I await early reply.</p>

                        minister August 12 has not been fulfilled, and the powers have been
                        compelled to rescue their ministers by force of arms unaided by the Chinese
                        Government, still this Government is ready to welcome any overtures for a
                        truce, and invite the other powers to join, when security is established in
                        the Chinese capital and the Chinese Government snows its ability and
                        willingness to make on its part an effective suspension of hostilities there
                        and elsewhere in China. When this is done—and we hope it will be done
                        promptly—the United States will be prepared to appoint a representative to

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your note of August 4 (17), and
                        to my reply thereto of the 23d instant, concerning a reported resolution of
                        the admirals of the allied fleets at Taku to interdict the Chinese
                        plenipotentiary, Li Hung Chang, from communication with the Chinese
                        authorities in the event of his arrival at Taku, I have now the honor to
                        inform you that a supplementary report, under date of yesterday, has been
                        cabled by the United States naval commander in those waters.</p>
                    <p>Admiral Remey therein states that in a conference with the admirals held on
                        that day (August 24) it was agreed that the Italian admiral should write to
                        the dean of the foreign legations in Pekin “for instructions in case Li Hung
                        Chang should arrive at Taku,” and it was also agreed that, pending a reply
                        from Pekin, Li Hung Chang should not be allowed to communicate “with shore
                        Chinese authorities.” Admiral Remey has dissented from the latter
                        proposition. He further reports that a misunderstanding has existed
                        concerning the action taken at a prior conference. He learns that the
                        conference considered that the prohibition to which your note of the 4th
                        (17th) relates had been agreed upon at a previous meeting, but that was not
                        the American admiral’s understanding. His objection, made at the time, was
                        acknowledged and should have been noted with any mention of the proposition,
                        but in the signed protocol of the meeting there was no formal note nor any
                        allusion to the matter. At the meeting of August 24 Admiral Remey states
                        that he would inform his Government of the misunderstanding, and he expects
                        that the fact of his disapproval will have been notified by the other
                        commanders to their respective Governments.</p>
                    <p>The views of the Government of the United States touching the action of the
                        admirals at Taku have been communicated to the representatives of the United
                        States in Berlin, Vienna, Paris, London, Rome, Tokyo, and St. Petersburgh
                        for communication to the governments to which they are respectively
                        accredited, so that the Russian Government is doubtless by this time advised
                        of our attitude in the matter.</p>
                    <p>I inclose for your fuller information a copy of the telegram in question,
                        which was sent on the evening of August 24.</p>
                    <p>The views of this Government have also been communicated to Admiral
                        Remey.</p>

                        <p>The following note was received by us from the chargé of the Russian
                            Government at this capital, August 17:</p>
                        <p>“I have just received a communication from the Imperial Government
                            informing me of the resolution of the admirals of the allied fleets
                            interdicting the plenipotentiary <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0025"
                            />of the Chinese Government, Li Hung chang, from all communication with
                            the Chinese authorities in the event of his arrival at Taku.</p>
                        <p>“This resolution being inexplicable, in view of the fact that all the
                            powers have recognized the utility of admitting his (Li Hung chang’s)
                            services, in the eventual negotiations for peace, and especially because
                            it would be impossible for him to fulfill his mission in the character
                            of Chinese plenipotentiary if this were done, it would be desirable that
                            the interested governments should give orders to countermand the
                            above-mentioned decision.”</p>
                        <p>Inquiry of Admiral Remey, commanding our fleet at Taku, was first
                            answered that no such resolution had been adopted. He now cables that
                            the admirals have agreed to write the dean of the legations in Pekin for
                            instructions in case Li Hung chang should arrive at Taku, and meantime
                            not to allow him to communicate with Chinese shore authorities. Remey
                            dissented from last proposition.</p>
                        <p>We take the same view expressed in the Russian note. In interests of
                            peace and effective presentation of just demands of all the powers
                            against China, it seems important that the Chinese plenipotentiary
                            should be able to communicate both with his own Government and its
                            military commanders, whose action will be necessary to any suspension of
                            hostilities as required in my telegram to you of 22d. Chinese minister
                            here is without powers or advices. Li Hung chang is prima facie
                            authorized by imperial decree to negotiate, and is the only
                            representative of responsible authority in China so far as we are
                            advised. We have instructed our representative in China in the spirit of
                            the Russian note.</p>
                        <p>Any misunderstanding or divergent action on this subject by
                            representatives of the powers in China would be unfortunate, and we
                            would be glad to learn from other powers if there are reasons not known
                            to us which in their judgment should lead to a view different from that
                            which we take.</p>

                    <p>The Russian chargé yesterday afternoon made to me an oral statement
                        respecting Russia’s purposes in China, to the following effect:</p>
                    <p>That as already repeatedly declared, Russia has no designs of territorial
                        acquisition in China; that, equally with other powers now operating there,
                        Russia has sought safety of legation at Pekin and to help the Chinese
                        Government to repress the troubles; that, incidentally to necessary
                        defensive measures on Russian border, Russia has occupied Niuchwang for
                        military purposes and, as soon as order is reestablished, will retire troops
                        therefrom if action of other powers be no obstacle thereto; that the purpose
                        for which the various governments have cooperated for relief of legations in
                        Pekin has been accomplished; that, taking the position that, as the Chinese
                        Government has left Pekin, there is no need for her representative to
                        remain, Russia has directed Russian minister to retire with his official
                        personnel from China; that the Russian troops will likewise be withdrawn;
                        and that when the Government of China shall regain the reins of government
                        and afford an authority with which the other powers can deal, and will
                        express desire to enter in negotiations, the Russian Government will also
                        name its representative. Holding these views and purposes, Russia expresses
                        hope that the United States will share the same opinion.</p>
                    <p>To this declaration our reply has been made by the following memorandum: <pb
                            n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0026"/>

                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Memorandum in response to the Russian
                                    chargé’s oral communication made on August 28, 1900, to the
                                    Acting Secretary of State touching the purposes of Russia in
                                    China.</hi></p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States receives with much satisfaction
                                the reiterated statement that Russia has no designs of territorial
                                acquisition in China, and that, equally with the other powers now
                                operating in China, Russia has sought the safety of her legation in
                                Pekin and to help the Chinese Government to repress the existing
                                troubles. The same purposes have moved and will continue to control
                                the Government of the United States, and the frank declarations of
                                Russia in this regard are in accord with those made to the United
                                States by the other powers. All the powers, therefore, having
                                disclaimed any purpose to acquire any part of China, and now that
                                adherence thereto has been renewed since relief has reached Pekin,
                                it ought not to be difficult by concurrent action through
                                negotiations to reach an amicable settlement with China by which the
                                treaty rights of all the powers will be secured for the future, the
                                open door assured, the interests and property of foreign citizens
                                conserved, and full reparation made for wrongs and injuries suffered
                                by them.</p>
                            <p>So far as we are advised, the greater part of China is at peace and
                                earnestly desires to protect the life and property of all
                                foreigners, and in several of the provinces active and successful
                                efforts to suppress the Boxers have been taken by the viceroys, to
                                whom we have extended encouragement through our consuls and naval
                                officers. This present good relation should be promoted for the
                                peace of China.</p>
                            <p>While we agree that the immediate object for which the military
                                forces of the powers have been cooperating, viz, the relief of the
                                ministers at Pekin, has been accomplished, there still remain the
                                other purposes which all the powers have in common, which are
                                referred to in the communication of the Russian chargé, and which
                                were specifically enumerated in our note to the powers of July
                                3.</p>
                            <p>These are: To afford all possible protection everywhere in China to
                                foreign life and property; to guard and protect all legitimate
                                foreign interests; to aid in preventing the spread of the disorders
                                to other provinces of the Empire and a recurrence of such disorders;
                                and to seek a solution which may bring about permanent safety and
                                peace to China, preserve Chinese territorial and administrative
                                entity, protect all rights guaranteed by treaty and international
                                law to friendly powers, and safeguard for the world the principle of
                                equal and impartial trade with all parts of the Chinese Empire.</p>
                            <p>In our opinion these purposes could best be attained by the joint
                                occupation of Pekin under a definite understanding between the
                                powers until the Chinese Government shall have been reestablished
                                and shall be in a position to enter into new treaties with adequate
                                provisions for reparation and guaranties of future protection. With
                                the establishment and recognition of such authority, the United
                                States would wish to withdraw its military forces from Pekin and
                                remit to the processes of peaceful negotiation our just demands.</p>
                            <p>We consider, however, that a continued occupation of Pekin would be
                                ineffective to produce the desired result unless all the powers
                                unite therein with entire harmony of purpose. Any power which
                                determines to withdraw its troops from Pekin will necessarily
                                proceed thereafter to protect its interests in China by its own
                                method, and we think that this would make a general withdrawal
                                expedient. As to the time and manner of withdrawal, we think that,
                                in view of the imperfect knowledge of the military situation
                                resulting from the interruptions of telegraphic communication, the
                                several military commanders at Pekin should be instructed to confer
                                and agree together upon the withdrawal as a concerted movement, as
                                they agreed upon the advance.</p>
                            <p>The result of these considerations is that, unless there is such a
                                general expression by the powers in favor of continued occupation as
                                to modify the views expressed by the Government of Russia and lead
                                to a general agreement for continued occupation, we shall give
                                instructions to the commander of the American forces in China to
                                withdraw our troops from Pekin after due conference with the other
                                commanders as to the time and manner of withdrawal.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States is much gratified by the
                                assurance given by Russia that the occupation of Niuchwang is for
                                military purposes incidental to the military steps for the security
                                of the Russian border provinces menaced by the Chinese, and that as
                                soon as order shall be reestablished Russia will retire her troops
                                from those places, if the action of the other powers be not an
                                obstacle thereto. No obstacle in this regard can arise through any
                                action of the United States, whose policy is fixed and has been
                                repeatedly proclaimed.</p>

                        <p>On the third day of the eighth moon of Kwang-hsu, twenty-sixth year
                            (August 27), the following imperial edict was issued:</p>
                        <p>“We hereby command Li Hung Chang, envoy plenipotentiary with full
                            discretionary powers and grand secretary of state, to proceed at once by
                            steam vessel to Pekin and there to associate himself with Prince Ching
                            in discussing and dealing with all pending questions. Let there be no
                            delay. Respect this.”</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>The above has been communicated to me in obedience to the imperial will.</p>
                    <p>Another communication from the privy council states an edict has already been
                        issued commanding Sir Robert Hart to confer with (the representatives of)
                        the foreign nations for the loan of a steam vessel to convey Li Hung Chang
                        without delay to Pekin, where he is to associate himself with Prince Ching
                        in dealing with all pending questions. <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0028"
                        />There was also a copy of an edict for Li Hung Chang, which the
                        inspector-general of customs (Sir Robert Hart) was directed to depute an
                        official to deliver in person (to Earl Li). The documents referred to have
                        been despatched by post, but on account of the roundabout method employed
                        and fearing a mistake or failure might arise, the edicts are respectfully
                        transcribed (as above). On receipt of the same, the Shantung government is
                        requested to transmit them by telegraph to Envoy Li.</p>
                    <p>Having received imperial orders urging my speedy departure for the North, it
                        behooves me to make arrangements to start on my journey soon. Please inform
                        Secretary of State and request instructions be telegraphed to the United
                        States commanders at Tientsin and Pekin to cooperate in affording me
                        protection if required.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: By direction of the Imperial
                        Chancellor I have the honor to respectfully communicate to your excellency
                        the following:</p>
                    <p>The Government of His Majesty the Emperor considers as a preliminary <pb
                            n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0030"/>condition for entering into
                        diplomatic negotiations with the Chinese Government a surrender of such
                        persons as are determined upon as being the first and real perpetrators of
                        the crimes committed in Pekin against international law. The number of
                        perpetrators who served as tools is too great; a wholesale execution would
                        be averse to the civilized conscience. Furthermore, circumstances would not
                        allow that even the group of leaders could be completely ascertained; but
                        the few among them whose guilt is notorious should be surrendered and
                        punished. The representatives of the powers in Pekin will be in a position
                        to make or adduce in this investigation fully valid testimony. The number of
                        those punished is of less importance than their character as principal
                        instigators and leaders. The Government of His Majesty the Emperor believes
                        that it can depend in this matter upon the concurrence of all the cabinets;
                        for, indifference toward the idea of a just expiation would be equivalent to
                        indifference toward a repetition of the crime.</p>
                    <p>The Government of His Majesty the Emperor therefore proposes to the
                        interested cabinets that they request their representatives in Pekin to
                        designate the principal Chinese personages whose guilt in the instigation or
                        execution of the crimes is beyond a doubt.</p>
                    <p>A similar communication is forwarded to the other interested cabinets.</p>
                    <p>Requesting of your excellency a reply as soon as is practicable, I embrace
                        this occasion to tender the assurance of my most distinguished
                        consideration.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In response to your inquiry of the 18th
                        instant as to the attitude of the Government of the United States in regard
                        to the exemplary punishment of the notable leaders in the crimes committed
                        in Pekin against international law, I have the honor to make the following
                        statement:</p>
                    <p>The Government of the United States has from the outset proclaimed its
                        purpose to hold to the uttermost accountability the responsible authors of
                        any wrongs done in China to citizens of the United States and their
                        interests, as was stated in the Government’s circular communication to the
                        powers of July 3 last. These wrongs have been committed not alone in Pekin,
                        but in many parts of the Empire, and their punishment is believed to be an
                        essential element of any effective settlement which shall prevent a
                        recurrence of such outrages and bring about permanent safety and peace in
                        China. It is thought, however, that no punitive measures can be so effective
                        by way of reparation for wrongs suffered and as deterrent examples for the
                        future as the degradation and punishment of the responsible authors by the
                        supreme Imperial authority itself; and it seems only just to China that she
                        should be afforded in the first instance an opportunity to do this and thus
                        rehabilitate herself before the world. Believing thus, and without abating
                        in any wise its deliberate purpose to exact the fullest accountability <pb
                            n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0031"/>from the responsible authors of the
                        wrongs we have suffered in China, the Government of the United States is not
                        disposed, as a preliminary condition to entering into diplomatic
                        negotiations with the Chinese Government, to join in demand that said
                        Government surrender to the powers such persons as, according to the
                        determination of the powers themselves, may be held to be the first and real
                        perpetrators of those wrongs. On the other hand, this Government is disposed
                        to hold that the punishment of the high responsible authors of these wrongs,
                        not only in Pekin but throughout China, is essentially a condition to be
                        embraced and provided for in the negotiations for a final settlement. It is
                        the purpose of this Government, at the earliest practicable moment, to name
                        its plenipotentiaries for negotiating a settlement with China, and in the
                        meantime to authorize its minister in Pekin to enter forthwith into
                        conference with the duly authorized representatives of the Chinese
                        Government with a view to bringing about a preliminary agreement whereby the
                        full exercise of the imperial power for the preservation of order and the
                        protection of foreign life and property throughout China, pending final
                        negotiations with the powers, shall be assured.</p>
                    <p>Accept, sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.</p>

                        Princes Tsai Lien and Tsai Ying are deprived of all their respective ranks
                        and offices; that Prince Tuan is deprived of office and is handed over to
                        the Imperial clan court, which shall consult and decide upon a severe
                        penalty, and his salary is to be stopped; that Duke Tsai Lan and the
                        President of the Censorate Ying Nien are handed over to the said board, who
                        shall consult and decide upon a severe penalty; and that Kang Yi, assistant

                            punishment of Prince Tuan and other high Chinese
                        officials.]</seg></opener>
                    <p>The Chinese minister communicated to the Secretary of State, on the 2d
                        instant, a telegram received by him from Director-General Sheng, conveying
                        the purport of an Imperial edict, dated September 25, 1900, by which the
                        degradation and punishment of Prince Tuan and other high Chinese officials
                        is decreed.</p>
                    <p>The Government of the United States is disposed to regard this measure as a
                        proof of the desire of the Imperial Chinese Government to satisfy the
                        reasonable demands of the foreign powers for the injury and outrage which
                        their legations and their nationals have suffered at the hands of
                        evil-disposed persons in China; although it has been thought well, in view
                        of the vagueness of the edict in regard to the punishment which some of the
                        inculpated persons are to receive, to signify to the Chinese minister the
                        President’s view that it would be most regrettable if Prince Tuan, who
                        appears from the concurring testimony of the legations in Pekin to have been
                        one of the foremost in the proceedings complained of, should escape such
                        full measure of exemplary punishment as the facts warrant, or if Kang Yi and
                        Chao Shu-Chiao should receive other than their just deserts.</p>
                    <p>With a view to forming a judgment on these points, the United States minister
                        in Pekin has been instructed to report whether the edict completely names
                        the persons deserving chastisement; whether the punishments proposed accord
                        with the gravity of the crimes committed; and in what manner the United
                        States and the other powers are to be assured that satisfactory punishment
                        is inflicted.</p>
                    <p>It is hoped that Mr. Conger’s replies to these interrogatories will confirm
                        the Government of the United States in the opinion which it now shares with
                        the Imperial German Government that the edict in question is an important
                        initial step in the direction of peace and order in China.</p>

                        attained. The thing now to be done is to obtain from the Chinese Government,
                        which has given to Prince Ching and Li Hung Chang full powers to negotiate
                        and treat in its name, appropriate reparation for the past and substantial

                        credentials.</p>
                    <p>It may be convenient to enumerate the clauses of the memorandum and to add
                        some observations dictated by the attitude of the United States in the
                        present circumstances.</p>
                    <p>1. The punishment of the guilty parties who may be designated by the
                        representatives of the powers at Pekin.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese Government has already indicated its intention to punish <pb
                            n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0034"/>a number of those responsible for the
                        recent disorders. The rep resentatives of the powers at Pekin may suggest
                        additions to that list when negotiations are entered upon.</p>
                    <p>2. The continuance of the interdiction against the importation of arms.</p>
                    <p>It is not understood that this interdiction is to be permanent, and the
                        duration of it and the details of its regulation seem a proper subject of
                        discussion by the negotiators.</p>
                    <p>3. Equitable indemnities for the governments, corporations, and private
                        individuals.</p>
                    <p>This is an object desired by all the powers. The Russian Government has
                        suggested that in case of protracted divergence of views, this matter might
                        be commended to the consideration of the International Court of Arbitration
                        of The Hague. The President thinks this suggestion worthy the attention of
                        the powers.</p>
                    <p>4. The organization in Pekin of a permanent guard for the legations.</p>
                    <p>The Government of the United States is unable to make any permanent
                        engagement of this nature without the authorization of the legislative
                        branch, but in the present emergency we have stationed in Pekin an adequate
                        legation guard.</p>
                    <p>5. The dismantling of the forts at Taku.</p>
                    <p>The President reserves the expression of his opinion as to this measure
                        pending the receipt of further information in regard to the situation in
                        China.</p>
                    <p>6. The military occupation of two or three points on the road from Tientsin
                        to Pekin.</p>
                    <p>The same observation which has been made in reference to No. 4 applies also
                        to this proposition. The President is unable to commit the United States” to
                        a permanent participation in such occupation, but he thinks it desirable
                        that the powers shall obtain from the Chinese Government the assurance of
                        their right to guard their legations in Pekin and to have the means of
                        unrestricted access to them whenever required.</p>
                    <p>The President believes that the Governments of France and the other powers
                        will see in the reserves we have here made no obstacle to the initiation of
                        negotiations on the lines suggested, and he hopes it will be found
                        practicable to begin such negotiations at an early day.</p>

                    <p>It has afforded me much pleasure to receive Your Imperial Majesty’s
                        telegraphic letter of October 14, which has been delivered by Your Majesty’s
                        minister in Washington.</p>
                    <p>I cordially share Your Majesty’s wish that there may be a peaceful settlement
                        of all questions between China and the powers whose interests and nationals
                        have so grievously suffered wrong in Your Majesty’s dominions, and that the
                        outcome may be the complete effacement of ill feeling between them. The
                        desire of this Government that such a settlement may be brought about
                        speedily has been made known to all the powers, and I trust that
                        negotiations may begin so soon as we and the other offended governments
                        shall be effectively satisfied of Your Majesty’s ability and power to treat
                        with just sternness the principal offenders, who are doubly culpable, not
                        alone toward the foreigners, but toward Your Majesty, under whose rule the
                        purpose of China to dwell in concord with the world has hitherto found
                        expression in the welcome and protection assured to strangers.</p>

                    <p>The Government of the Republic has highly appreciated the response which the
                        Government of the United States has made to its note of the 4th of October;
                        it has been especially gratifying to it to observe the sentiments of
                        sympathy for France which have evidently inspired that reply.</p>
                    <p>All the interested powers have adhered to the essential principle of the
                        French note. In so far as concerns the points which have called forth
                        comments on the part of certain cabinets, they could, it would seem, be
                        discussed among the powers or between their diplomatic representatives at
                        Pekin in the course of the negotiations and receive such modifications as
                        might be judged necessary in order to more surely and speedily attain the
                        common end.</p>
                    <p>The essential thing now is to show the Chinese Government, which has declared
                        itself ready to negotiate, that the powers are animated by the same spirit;
                        that they are decided to respect the integrity of China <pb n="30"
                            xml:id="pg_30" facs="0036"/>and the independence of its Government, but
                        that they are none the less resolved to obtain the satisfaction to which
                        they have a right.</p>
                    <p>In this regard it would seem that if the proposition which has been accepted
                        as the basis of negotiations were communicated to the Chinese
                        plenipotentiaries by the ministers of the powers at Pekin, or in their name
                        by their dean, this step would be of a nature to have a happy influence upon
                        the determinations of the Emperor of China and of his Government.</p>
                    <p>It goes without saying that this collective step would in no wise interfere
                        with the examination of the points in the French proposition to which the
                        reservations made by certain governments relate.</p>
                    <p>The minister for foreign affairs would be particularly happy to learn that
                        this is also the opinion of the President of the United States and of the
                        honorable Secretary of State, and that they have thought it opportune to
                        send to the minister of the United States in Pekin instructions in this
                        sense.</p>

                        of October 4, and trusts that such reservations as they have suggested will,
                        like those mentioned in the reply of the United States, prove no
                        embarrassment to the progress of the negotiation, in the course of which
                        they can be frankly discussed with a view to a common agreement.</p>
                    <p>Holding, as it does in accord with the French Government, that the essential
                        thing now is to prove to the Chinese Government that the powers are ready to
                        meet it in the path of peaceful negotiation, and that they are united in
                        their repeatedly declared decision to respect the integrity of China and the
                        independence of its Government, while equally united in the resolve to
                        obtain rightful satisfaction for the great wrongs they and their nationals
                        have suffered, this Government has instructed its minister in Pekin to
                        concur in presenting to the Chinese plenipotentiaries the points upon which
                        we are agreed as the initial step toward negotiations and toward the
                        reestablishment of the effective power and authority of the Imperial
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>The Government of the United States believes that the happy influence upon
                        the determinations of the Chinese Emperor and of his Government which the
                        Government of the French Republic anticipates as the result of the step
                        would be still further induced if the powers were to include as part of
                        their initial declaration a collective manifestation of their determination
                        to preserve the territorial integrity and the administrative entirety of
                        China, and to secure for the Chinese nation and for themselves the benefits

                        receipt of your note of the 23d of October, inclosing the text of an
                        agreement between Great Britain and Germany relating to affairs in China
                        which was signed in London on the 16th instant by the Marquis of Salisbury

                    <p>These principles are— <quote rend="blockquote">

                                Government will not on their part make use of the present
                                complication to obtain for themselves any territorial advantages in
                                Chinese dominions and will direct their policy toward maintaining
                                undiminished the territorial condition of the Chinese Empire.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The United States have heretofore made known their adoption of both these
                        principles. During the last year this Government invited the powers
                        interested in China to join in an expression of views and purposes in the
                        direction of impartial trade with that country and received satisfactory
                        assurances to that effect from all of them. When the recent troubles were at
                        their height, this Government, on the 3d of July, once more made an
                        announcement of its policy regarding impartial trade and the integrity of
                        the Chinese Empire, and had the gratification of learning that all the
                        powers held similar views. And since that time the most gratifying harmony
                        has existed among all the nations concerned as to the ends to be pursued,
                        and there has been little divergence of opinion as to the details of the
                        course to be followed.</p>
                    <p>It is therefore with much satisfaction that the President directs me to
                        inform you of the full sympathy of this Government with those of Her
                        Britannic Majesty and the German Emperor in the principles set forth in the
                        clauses of the agreement above cited.</p>
                    <p>The third clause of the agreement provides— <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>III. In case of another power making use of the complications in
                                China in order to obtain under any form whatever such territorial
                                advantages, the two contracting parties reserve to themselves to
                                come to a preliminary understanding as to the eventual steps to be

                    </p>
                    <p>As this clause refers to a reciprocal arrangement between the two high
                        contracting powers, the Government of the United States does not regard
                        itself as called upon to express an opinion in respect to it.</p>

                        Government, but was himself powerless to prevent what has happened. It was
                        understood that the visits were only friendly visits, and so no discussion
                        of business was had. He said he was awaiting the arrival <pb n="33"

                        conducted at Shanghai, or, better still, at Washington. The question is so
                        large and so many of the great powers vitally interested therein that
                        constant and quick communication between all is necessary. This can not be
                        accomplished from here. The telegraph line is at present totally inadequate
                        and is not likely to be sufficiently improved in the near future.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to append hereto translations
                        of your telegram of the 30th ultimo sent through the United States minister
                        at Tokyo and my telegram of the 12th instant.</p>
                    <p>Some of the Russian troops have already been withdrawn. The minister told me
                        yesterday that he should leave to-day, and that most of their forces were
                        going at once, but he has not gone and troops that were ordered to move this
                        morning are still held here. * * *</p>
                    <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0040"/>
                    <p>The weakness of the Imperial Government becomes daily more apparent, and the
                        possibility of restoration of peace and order in this province under Chinese
                        authority still more remote. We have now had possession of Peking for four
                        weeks, and the only move made by the Chinese Government toward a settlement
                        is to send Prince Ching herewith reputed full powers, but which have not
                        been shown, and the statement that he is waiting for Li Hung-chang, who is
                        to act with him. But a telegram received from Consul-General Goodnow of the
                        7th instant says, “Li Hung-chang will leave for the north in a week or so.”
                        There is not, therefore, much prospect of any early propositions from them.
                        I repeat that I am sure they will be unable to offer any feasible plan, and
                        that the foreign powers will be compelled to devise the plan and China will
                        be compelled to accept it.</p>
                    <p>The negotiations necessary, therefore, are those between the powers, and
                        these can be conducted almost anywhere better than here.</p>
                    <p>No visible effort has been made by the Chinese Government for a suspension of
                        hostilities. “Boxers” and Chinese soldiers are still in possession of most
                        of the cities and villages of this province, and persecutions of Christians
                        continue.</p>
                    <p>It does not seem to me advisable for the general conference of the powers to
                        await the restoration of Chinese authority in and about this capital. But in
                        my judgment the withdrawal of all troops from Peking would be a great
                        mistake. The Chinese people would doubt our strength, we would lose one of
                        the most potent levers with which to move the Chinese Government to an
                        acceptance of our terms, and the thousands of Chinese Christians in this
                        vicinity would be immediately massacred.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: A whole month has elapsed since the arrival of
                        the “relief expedition” and the flight of the imperial court, and apparently
                        no progress has been made toward reestablishment of Chinese authority here
                        or negotiations for a settlement.</p>
                    <p>Prince Ching is still waiting the arrival of Li Hung-chang. Most of the
                        foreign ministers are without instructions. At a meeting of the diplomatic
                        corps yesterday it was suggested that if the Emperor and Empress Dowager
                        could be induced to return to Peking negotiations might be greatly
                        facilitated. All agreed that if they could be withdrawn from the influence
                        of Prince Tuan and other pernicious advisers it would be better. Much time
                        could also be saved, because if acts of Prince Ching and Li Hung-chang must
                        be presented to the Throne for approval, it would take weeks to get them to
                        Sianfu and returned.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that each would write an informal note to Prince Ching
                        suggesting the return of the Emperor and Empress Dowager, the Court, or the
                        Emperor, as he pleased. I preferred to mention only the “Emperor,” and have
                        written Prince Ching accordingly, inclosing a copy herewith of the note sent
                        him.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Highness</hi>: I have the honor to address your
                            highness concerning the existing situation. Into the cause of that
                            situation it is not necessary at this moment to inquire. It is
                            sufficient to refer to the fact that in order to relieve the foreign
                            legations from imminent peril a joint expedition was undertaken by
                            various foreign powers, which has led to the withdrawal of the court and
                            the present occupation of the capital.</p>
                        <p>The main object of this expedition was the relief of the legations, and
                            as soon as that was accomplished the ministers showed their willingness
                            to terminate hostilities by welcoming your highness back to Peking for
                            the purpose of opening peace negotiations.</p>
                        <p>These negotiations seem to be delayed by the nonarrival of the grand
                            secretary, Li Hung-chang. In the meantime I beg to point out to your
                            highness that it is my personal opinion that permanent peace
                            negotiations would be very much facilitated if the Emperor were also to
                            return to the capital.</p>
                        <p>It is, as your highness must acknowledge, difficult to restore
                            tranquillity to the country while the minds of the people are disturbed
                            by uncertainty as to the future, and nothing would reassure them more
                            than His Majesty’s return. While he remains at a distance, surrounded by
                            the same advisers as before, the prospect of a permanent settlement must
                            remain doubtful, however successful your highness may be in arranging
                            its terms, for it suggests both to foreign governments and to the people
                            that there will be no change in the policy of the Throne toward foreign
                            powers and their subjects in China.</p>
                        <p>I therefore venture to suggest to your highness the advisability of
                            making known to His Majesty the views herein expressed, and I beg to add
                            that there need be no apprehension that if he returns he will be treated
                            otherwise than with all respect or subjected to any restraint.</p>
                        <p>I am sure that the treatment your highness has received since your return
                            will support this assurance.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: On the 16th instant I had the
                            honor to receive your excellency’s note, in which you state that the
                            main object of the expedition sent by the various foreign powers was the
                            relief of the legations, and as soon as that was accomplished the
                            ministers showed their willingness to terminate hostilities and open
                            peace negotiations. Your excellency also pointed out that it is your
                            personal opinion that permanent peace negotiations would be very much
                            facilitated if the Emperor were to return to the capital; that the minds
                            of the people are disturbed, and nothing would reassure them more than
                            His Majesty’s return. While he remains at a distance the prospect of a
                            permanent settlement must remain doubtful, however successful I may be
                            in arranging its terms, for it suggests that there will be no change in
                            the policy of the Throne toward foreign powers and their subjects in
                            China. Your excellency <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0042"/>therefore
                            suggested the advisability of making known to His Majesty the views
                            expressed in your note and to add that there need be no apprehension
                            that if he returns he will be treated otherwise than with all
                            respect.</p>
                        <p>In reply, I beg to observe that on account of the reckless manner in
                            which disturbances have been caused by the Chinese banditti, which
                            resulted in a revolution suddenly breaking out, the forces of the
                            various foreign powers came to Peking to relieve the legations. I feel a
                            deep sense of shame that this should have been found necessary.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency’s note is full of peaceful sentiments. You say that the
                            return of His Majesty will have the effect of reassuring the minds of
                            the people. From this it is evident that your excellency is interested
                            in what is good and right, and that you hold upright and noble views.
                            Words are inadequate to express my gratitude and thanks for your
                            excellency’s kindly expressions.</p>
                        <p>I have, together with some of the high ministers of Peking, prepared a
                            joint memorial to the Emperor requesting his return to Peking. I shall
                            have a copy of your excellency’s note made and send it to His Majesty,
                            together with the other memorial, within a day.</p>
                        <p>The grand secretary, Li Hung-chang, has already left Shanghai for
                            Tientsin and should be here in a few days. When the terms of peace have
                            been determined upon and settled, (China) will not fail to see that they
                            are wholly and sincerely acted upon. On no account will matters be

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to confirm my telegrams of
                        the 24th and 27th instants and to say that at this end of the line but
                        little, if any, progress is being made toward a settlement of existing
                        troubles.</p>
                    <p>Better order is being established in the city, and particularly in the
                        portions under the jurisdiction of the Americans and Japanese; the Chinese
                        are returning to their homes, opening their shops, etc., but each army is
                        acting independently and controlling in its own way the section over which
                        it has charge.</p>
                    <p>Outside the city the Chinese soldiers and Boxers are as active and hostile as
                        ever. Scouts and reconnoitering parties are meeting them or being fired upon
                        from ambush almost daily.</p>
                    <p>Foreign troops have been sent out in various directions from 5 to 30 miles
                        and have met and punished them severely in several places, but they return
                        again or others appear elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>On the 25th instant a note was received by the dean of the diplomatic corps
                        from Prince Ching, copy of which I inclose, reciting the efforts of the ad
                        interim viceroy of Chihli (I think the provincial treasurer, since executed
                        by the Pao-ting punitive expedition) to exterminate the Boxers, but we have
                        no evidence of the success of his efforts, and I apprehend they do not
                        extend much beyond the issuance of orders and proclamations, to which little
                        or no attention is paid. I also inclose copy of a note received by the dean
                        of the diplomatic corps yesterday, transmitting copy of an Imperial decree
                        appointing Jung Lu to assist in peace negotiations, and also ordering Prince
                        Ching to communicate concerning negotiations with the Viceroys Liu Kun-yi of
                        Nanking and Chang Chih-tung of Wuchang.</p>
                    <p>These viceroys are at their homes. Li Hung-chang is at Tientsin, Jung Lu is
                        at Paoting-fu, and Prince Ching here. None of them has exhibited any powers,
                        nor has there been any request made to start negotiations.</p>
                    <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0043"/>
                    <p>The Russian minister, with his whole legation staff, removed to Tientsin on
                        the 29th. The French are to follow soon. The Germans have been ordered to go
                        when the others do. The Japanese have expressed a willingness to go, so that
                        there seems little prospect of beginning early negotiations here. There is
                        considerable objection to accepting Jung Lu as a negotiator, because during
                        the siege he was commander in chief of the Imperial troops, and soldiers
                        belonging to his special corps were often in evidence in our immediate
                        front. I am not sure, however, that it will be persisted in.</p>
                    <p>It has been my idea, and with which, upon conferring freely, as directed,
                        with Mr. Rockhill, I find he agrees, that negotiations of the most
                        preliminary character should be started here at once, or just as soon as the
                        Chinese Government showed an earnest effort and a sincere desire to
                        negotiate.</p>
                    <p>For instance, declaring the purpose of the foreign powers in landing troops
                        in China, and the Chinese agreeing at once to suspend hostilities, restore
                        order, and speedily arrange for just and reasonable indemnity to the several
                        powers and for full reparation for all wrongs and injuries suffered by their
                        citizens and subjects, and to guarantee that for the future the treaty and
                        international rights of all the powers shall be secure and all interests and
                        property of foreign citizens be adequately conserved, and mutually agreeing
                        that plenipotentiaries shall be appointed to negotiate an equitable
                        settlement of all the questions arising out of the recent troubles, and that
                        as soon as such plenipotentiaries are duly named and qualified the foreign
                        troops, except adequate legation guards, not to exceed an average of 1,000
                        for each legation, shall be retired to points near the coast pending the
                        completion of negotiations, etc. This would make a start, would give a base
                        for negotiations, which could then be conducted at some convenient place for
                        the powers, and the presence of the allied forces at Peking and coast points
                        would compel Chinese to keep faith, at least pending the completion of
                        negotiations. If this can not be done, and done quickly, complications are
                        likely to arise and possible differences among the powers result, which will
                        compel separate settlements and the certain dissolution of the Empire.</p>
                    <p>The Germans are now insisting upon the surrender and punishment of the
                        original and real instigators of the crisis in Peking * * * before any
                        negotiations whatever are begun. This should by all means be accomplished,
                        and probably can be, before final settlement, but if it is to be insisted on
                        as preliminary to all, then no negotiations will be possible.</p>

                        <p>The 29th the viceroy pro tempore of Ohihli addressed to me the following
                            communication:</p>
                        <p>“I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of the communication in which
                            you say to me: ‘The Boxers of Chihli and of Peking are within your
                            jurisdiction, and you ought to disperse them without delay. If they dare
                            to recommence the struggle, exterminate them with your soldiers in order
                            to prevent new reprisals.’ Mr. de Giers told me in an interview that in
                            the neighborhood of Feng-tai, where they were repairing the railway,
                            there were still Boxers armed with guns, who held the country, and
                            requested me to have them disbanded or destroyed. It is necessary that
                            you act with vigor.</p>
                        <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0044"/>
                        <p>“The beginning of hostilities between China and the powers [said the pro
                            tempore viceroy of Chihli] had for its origin the existence of the
                            Boxers. They are the cause of the ruin of Peking and of Tientsin and of
                            the destruction of the inhabitants. My heart has been most grievously
                            affected, and I burn with a desire to take and execute their chiefs and
                            arrest their followers. But thinking of the means to accomplish this, I
                            consider that the deserted soldiers are also scattered everywhere for
                            the purpose of creating disorder, and that the first thing to do is to
                            suppress them. I have not a sufficient military force for both
                            tasks.</p>
                        <p>“I have commenced by presenting to the Throne the question of the Boxers
                            and asking for an Imperial decree ordering all the great military chiefs
                            to exterminate them. On the 10th instant the Taotai Tan Wen-huan, at the
                            head of the Boxer chiefs Tsao Fu-tien, etc., nine in all, came to
                            Tientsin to renew the troubles. I immediately sent some officers to
                            arrest these Boxers. Eight were beheaded and their (heads) exposed. Tan
                            Wen-huan escaped by a circuitous route. Three Boxers were taken alive.
                            Che San, one of them, was examined, sentenced, and beheaded. As to Tan
                            Wen-huan, I have requested from the Throne his degredation.</p>
                        <p>“Tsao Fu-tien is the chief of the Boxers of Shantung and was the
                            instigator of the troubles at Tientsin, but the Tsao arrested at
                            Tientsin is another individual. The real Tsao Fu-tien has fled with the
                            Taotai Tan, but his crimes are innumerable and his capital condemnation
                            is necessary for the public good. As to the other Boxers, they are the
                            principal leaders in the subprefectures of Ching Hai and Yen Chiu
                            (Chihli). I think it is necessary to decapitate them or they will
                            continue to incite uprisings among the people.</p>
                        <p>“After the destruction of Peking and Tientsin a large number of Boxers
                            took refuge in the subprefecture of Liang Hsiang, near Peking, and
                            around Tientsin there are also some. If they are not immediately
                            exterminated they will recommence their mischief. So I have sent some
                            large forces to exterminate them. I have also sent a brigadier-general
                            from Tientsin, Lin Che-piao, and a lieutenant colonel, Tan Tien-kuei,
                            into the north of Chihli; a general of division, Lu Pen-yuen, in the
                            region of Ho-chkiu-fu (near Tientsin), with order to confer with the
                            general commanding at T’sang Chou, Nei Tsung-yi, and I have enjoined all
                            the camps from south to north to unite their efforts, hoping thus to
                            destroy the very root of the Boxers. Those which were at Tientsin exist
                            no longer. This then is the present situation of the question of
                            suppressing the Boxers.</p>
                        <p>“I have received the communication in which it is said that the European
                            powers desire to send out troops to exterminate the Boxers in order to
                            end the troubles and protect the merchants. Now the Boxers sometimes
                            show themselves and then disperse. I fear that the arrival of foreign
                            troops would frighten the people and cause them to flee en masse, while
                            the Boxers would scatter on all sides. So China herself ought to
                            accomplish the task of exterminating the Boxers in her own territory and
                            of protecting the missionaries in order to hasten the conclusion of
                            peace and the protection of commerce.</p>
                        <p>“In regard to the region of Feng-tai, where they are at present repairing
                            the railway, and where there are still some Boxers, it is necessary to
                            immediately exterminate them; but in these localities there are foreign
                            troops. If the Chinese troops are sent there it is to be feared that
                            conflicts will occur.</p>
                        <p>“I beg you to discuss this question with the foreign ministers. When
                            European troops may be in the neighborhood they ought to permit the
                            Chinese troops to pass for the purpose of going to fight the Boxers,
                            each controlling their own soldiers and not impeded by the operations of
                            the others. This will facilitate the suppression of the rioters,
                            etc.”</p>
                        <p>I (Prince Ching) consider that the viceroy pro tempore of Chihli offers
                            some excellent ideas concerning the suppression of the Boxers, and that
                            his letter is very sensible. I therefore submit it to the examination of
                            your excellency, and beg you to communicate it to your colleagues.</p>

                            and Chang Chih-tung. I have besides charged Jung Lu to concert with them
                            in negotiating; and in order to facilitate their relations Jung Lu has
                            gone to Huo-lu. I order him to go <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0045"

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to confirm Department
                        telegrams of September 22 and 29 and mine of October 1, 3, and 4. I also
                        inclose copy of Imperial decree mentioned in my telegram of the 3d instant,
                        and which has to-day been received by the dean of the diplomatic corps from
                        Prince Ching. The punishments so far as named are grossly inadequate. Titles
                        of nobility can easily be restored, and it is not uncommon for a Chinese
                        officer to be degraded, and soon thereafter to be reinstated or promoted to
                        a higher place. Governor Yü Hsien and General Tung Fu-hsiang, who, with the
                        exception of Prince Tuan, were the worst of all, are not mentioned in the
                        decree.</p>
                    <p>The question of punishment is most important, but, in my judgment, it may
                        well be left until after preliminary negotiations are begun.</p>
                    <p>The arrival of Li Hung-chang is still awaited. More German troops are
                        arriving, while American and Japanese are being withdrawn. The foreign
                        ministers all seem to be waiting definite instructions, so no apparent
                        progress is being made. However, I shall do whatever I properly may to
                        facilitate the preliminary negotiations.</p>
                    <p>I have, etc.,</p>

                        <p>On the 25th of September the grant secretariat received a decree as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>The trouble at the present time which broke out between China and foreign
                            countries is a revolutionary movement quite out of the ordinary, and has
                            been the cause of bringing calamity upon us. This was not in accordance
                            with our wish, and it is all due to the princes and ministers of state
                            having participated in and protected the “Boxer” banditti movement, thus
                            embroiling us in trouble with friendly nations, causing injury to our
                            state and our removing from the capital.</p>
                        <p>We certainly can not but acknowledge that we are at fault and reprove
                            ourselves, the princes and ministers having without cause stirred up the
                            present trouble. It is urgently necessary that they should have meted
                            out to them various degrees of a severe form of punishment.</p>
                        <p>Let Prince Chuang, Prince I, Tsai Lien, and Tsai Ying (the last two
                            princes of the third order) be deprived of their rank or title of
                            nobility. Prince Tuan we treat (more) leniently, and he is hereby
                            removed from all his official appointments and handed over to the
                            Imperial clan court for the determination of a severe form of penalty;
                            he is’ also deprived of his official salary. Duke Lan, and Ying Men,
                            president of the censorate, are ordered to be handed over to the yamen
                            concerned for the determination of a severe form of punishment. K’ang I,
                            assistant grand secretary and president of the board of civil office,
                            and Chao Shu-chiao, president of the board of punishments, are to be
                            handed over to the censorate and board of civil office for the
                            determination of a penalty, in order to make an example of them.</p>
                        <p>We have been charged and intrusted by our ancestors with the performance
                            of an important post. Our only hope is to serve and protect the public
                            interests, regardless of others. The princes and ministers have not
                            served the country as good statesmen, and they have themselves to blame.
                            This is understood by the officials and people of the Empire.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to confirm, on the overleaf,
                        my telegram of the 16th instant, and to inclose copy of the convention
                        submitted by Prince Ching and Earl Li Hung-chang, their note of transmission
                        and my acknowledgment thereof. The dean of the diplomatic corps also
                        received a brief note requesting the ministers to visit the
                        plenipotentiaries to discuss the proposed terms of settlement on the 20th
                        instant, or on any other day which might suit their convenience.</p>
                    <p>The German minister has not yet arrived; the new British minister is here,
                        but has not yet taken charge; the French minister is ill, so there must
                        still be some delay before commencing negotiations. In the meantime I hope
                        to receive reply to my telegram of the 16th instant.</p>
                    <p>It will be useless for the foreign representatives to meet with Chinese
                        plenipotentiaries for discussion until the powers have more fully agreed
                        among themselves. I still think it best, as I have already written you, and
                        which I understand is in accordance with the view of the Department, that a
                        convention, the most preliminary possible, should be made, which shall
                        include the restoration of order, the reestablishment of potential
                        government, agreements to negotiate, how and when, guaranties of punishment,
                        indemnities, and future protection of all foreign rights and interests; to
                        be followed by due appointment of plenipotentiaries, who shall make, as
                        nearly as can be done, a general final settlement, leaving as little as
                        possible for separate negotiations between the separate powers. However, a
                        purpose seems now to be indicated by most of the representatives here to let
                        the very first negotiations include and settle as much as possible, and let
                        separate negotiations with the various powers settle the rest.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>The expeditions which left here and Tientsin for Pao-ting Fu some days since
                        met with no opposition on the way, and the city was surrendered on their
                        approach without firing a gun.</p>
                    <p>We have no information of their determination as to proceeding farther into
                        the interior or returning, though it is reported that the French and German
                        troops will remain there indefinitely, the former because of their and the
                        Belgian interest in the railroad and the latter for what reason is not
                        known.</p>
                    <p>Count von Waldersee is here, but further great international movements appear
                        not to be necessary. Chinese soldiers, so says Li Hung-chang, nave been
                        ordered not to fire on or oppose the movements of the foreign armies in any
                        way. This seems to be confirmed by the reports from the Pao-ting Fu
                        expeditions, and indicates a practical suspension of hostilities in this
                        province.</p>
                    <p>I have seen the French proposals and anxiously await your views thereon. Lord
                        Salisbury telegraphed the British minister that all the Governments have
                        agreed to them.</p>
                    <p>I have, etc.</p>

                        <p>Last spring the Boxer bandits made their appearance around Peking and
                            caused the most unheard of calamities; they multiplied so fast that at
                            last they besieged the foreign legations, and then the powers sent
                            troops to Peking and the Court removed to a distant place. If anyone had
                            predicted these events several months beforehand nobody would have
                            believed him. But now the Court is aware that these misfortunes came
                            through the protection given the Boxer banditti by princes and
                            ministers; these delinquents, therefore, are to be severely punished
                            according to Chinese law, as the proper tribunals may decide, and we,
                            Prince Ching and Li Hung-chang, have been appointed plenipotentiaries
                            with full powers to open negotiations for peace at once and settle this
                            affair. But our negotiations will not be confined to one country, nor
                            will the questions be the same with all the countries concerned; add to
                            this the unusual nature of the case and it will be seen that the
                            negotiations are beset with difficulties.</p>
                        <p>In view of this we think it will be better first to settle general
                            questions with the combined powers in a special convention applying to
                            all, and then proceed to negotiate a separate treaty in detail with each
                            power as varying conditions will require. This done, the commercial
                            treaties may then be settled if any changes are to be made in existing
                            ones, and, finally, rules for application of treaty provisions in
                            specified provinces may be made for the common benefit and lasting
                            security of both high contracting parties.</p>
                        <p>We inclose herewith for your consideration and that of the diplomatic
                            corps copy of draft of the preliminary convention we propose, and we ask
                            that your excellency will telegraph our proposals to your Department of
                            State, with the view to an early settlement of these matters.</p>
                        <p>Besides sending you this copy we have sent similar ones to your
                            colleagues, and we now beg your excellency to consider this matter and
                            favor us with a reply.</p>

                        <p>His Majesty the Emperor, being oppressed with sorrow for the unexpected
                            events of the past few months, has now appointed the writer, Prince
                            Ching, to return to Peking to verbally express this sentiment, and has
                            given to us, namely, Prince Ching and Minister Li Hung-chang, full
                            plenipotentiary powers to settle all affairs that may come under
                            discussion. As a preliminary we now submit the subjoined draft of
                            articles proposed for a special convention between the combined powers
                            and China: <list>
                                <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Article</hi> 1. Laying siege to legations
                                    of foreign ministers is a high offense against one of the
                                    important principles of international law. No country can
                                    possibly tolerate such a thing. China acknowledges her great
                                    fault in this respect and promises that it shall never occur
                                    again.</item>
                                <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 2. China admits her liability
                                    to pay indemnity for the various losses sustained on this
                                    occasion, and the powers will each appoint officials to examine
                                    and present all claims for final consultation and
                                    settlement.</item>
                                <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 3. As to future trade and
                                    general international relations, each power should designate how
                                    these matters should be dealt with—whether the old treaties
                                    shall continue or new conventions be made slightly adding to the
                                    old treaties or canceling the old treaties and negotiating new
                                    ones. Any of these plans may be adopted, and when China has
                                    approved further special regulations can be made in each case as
                                    required.</item>
                                <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 4. This convention will be made
                                    by China with the combined powers to cover general principles
                                    which apply alike to all. This settled, the foreign ministers
                                    will remove the seals they caused to be placed in various parts
                                    of the tsungli yamen, and then the yamen ministers may go to the
                                    yamen and attend to business as usual. And, further, each power
                                    should arrange its own special affairs with China, so that
                                    separate treaties may be settled in due order. When the various
                                    items of indemnity are all arranged properly, or an
                                    understanding has been come to about them, then the powers will

                        of a letter from Mr. Thomas D. Holmes, stating that Major Siao, the Chinese
                        military official of Kinhwa, province of Chenkiang, China, rescued him and
                        his family and another family—eight persons in all—from certain death at the
                        hands of a Chinese mob in that city, and that for this act of kindness Major

                    <p>The disgrace or other vindictive treatment of any official counseling
                        friendly action toward foreigners or aiding them in their perilous straits
                        is indirectly but none the less effectively a wrong to foreigners. A
                        striking instance of this was seen in the decapitation of the two friendly
                        members of the tsungli yamen and in the beheading of Chang Yen Hoon,
                        formerly minister of China in Washington. Such acts not only deserve the
                        severest censure, but persistence in their commission must inevitably impair
                        if not destroy confidence in the protestations of the Chinese Government of
                        its desire and purpose to punish the authors and abettors of antiforeign
                        outrages.</p>

                            family, about seven years in the interior of China. Last July we were
                            hopelessly surrounded by a Chinese mob and were about to be murdered,
                            but Major Siao, the military official of the city Kinhwa, in Chenkiang
                            province, where we were, rescued us at the risk of his own life and gave
                            us a private bodyguard and escort of 20 soldiers to Shanghai, and lent
                            us $100 besides. For this act of kindness I learn that he has been
                            recalled to Hangchao and degraded. Can not our Government look into the
                            matter and, through our minister, protest to the viceroy at Hangchao
                            against such treatment? The man had been in that position for eighteen
                            years, and was a good official.</p>
                        <p>I beg that this matter may be looked into, for if he had not helped us
                            two families of eight persons would have been murdered.</p>

                    <p>I have obtained from the French minister a copy of the French propositions,
                        and think we can use them as a base to work from. The new British minister

                        one for whom such support is deemed necessary. But, realizing the unusually
                        difficult problem before me, and knowing Mr. Rockhill’s familiarity with the
                        views and policies of the Department of State and his experience in
                        important special diplomatic work, I should like very much to have his

                        26th instant, and to say that on yesterday the several foreign ministers met
                        to formally begin the discussion of terms of a settlement to be presented to
                        the Chinese plenipotentiaries. Each had been instructed that all the powers
                        had agreed substantially or in principle with the French propositions; and
                        as the question of punishments was the first of these, it was the first
                        taken up. After much discussion it was unanimously decided that the
                        punishment of death should be demanded for 11 officials, whom, it is agreed
                        by all foreign ministers and Chinese Government, are chiefly responsible for
                        the crimes committed, to wit, Princes Tuan, Chuang and I (Pu Ching), Tsai
                        Lien and Ysai Ying, Duke Lan, Tung Fu-hsiang, Yü Hsien, K’ang I, Chao
                        Shu-chiao, Ying Men. The manner of their death was much discussed, but it is
                        believed that whatever we demanded, most of them would either voluntarily or
                        by Imperial order commit suicide, so we simply say “death.” I have to-day
                        received a note from Li Hung-chang, which I inclose, informing me that Kang
                        I had died and that Governor Yü Hsien had taken his own life by swallowing
                        gold leaf.</p>
                    <p>The details that come to us of the horrible murder and mutilation of our
                        missionaries in the interior are so frightfully shocking that less severe
                        punishment can not be asked, and I believe the Chinese Government are so
                        impressed by the terrible results of their efforts to get rid of the
                        foreigners that they will readily accede to our demand unless the court is
                        held in the power of those who are to be thus punished; <pb n="44"

                        it and to furnish ample and satisfactory proof of its accomplishment.
                        Provision must also be made for adequate punishment for all provincial and
                        local officials who may be proved to be in any way responsible for or

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: We have just received your
                            excellency’s communication, in which you state that reports have been
                            reaching you that reactionary and disturbing officials are being
                            appointed in the Yangtze provinces; that the power of the viceroys is
                            being undermined, and the removal of the viceroys of the Liang Hu
                            provinces and of Nanking is contemplated, but that you can not believe
                            this, etc.</p>
                        <p>In reply we have the honor to say that it is very evident from your
                            excellency’s communication that you are sincerely friendly in your
                            intercourse with us, for which we feel exceedingly grateful.</p>
                        <p>We would observe, however, that in regard to the two viceroys—Liang Hu
                            provinces and Nanking—a decree was recently issued appointing these
                            officers to consult with us in arranging terms of peace, and they are
                            granted the position of minister plenipotentiary. The court certainly
                            relies on the position of these officers, and they certainly have not
                            been removed from their respective posts. Even supposing that the idea
                            [of their removal] emanated from persons who are opposed to them, still
                            the fact of their being high officials of the Government would certainly
                            prevent them from venturing to defeat or overthrow them before the very
                            presence of the Throne. We may inform your excellency that we have never
                            heard of the reports to which you allude, and even your excellency knows
                            that they are certainly not really true.</p>
                        <p>In sending this communication in reply to your excellency’s, which we beg
                            you will duly take note of, we ask you not to listen to false reports,
                            etc.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to confirm my telegram of the
                        28th. To make the Chinese Government indemnify native Christians for wrongs
                        to their persons and property by the “Boxer” movement, the responsibility
                        for which the Imperial Government practically acknowledges, would be a most
                        humane act, and would give to missionary work great prestige for the future;
                        but it would open up an almost limitless field of investigation, and I am of
                        the opinion that if the missionary societies are adequately indemnified for
                        their mission as well as their personal property, and commensurate
                        punishment exacted for guilty or negligent officials, that it will be going
                        far enough.</p>
                    <p>The missionaries can themselves settle many of the losses of their native
                        Christians with the villagers where the losses have occurred. In fact, in
                        some places the headmen of some localities have already proposed to rebuild
                        the chapels and missionary residences destroyed.</p>
                    <p>After much discussion the ministers have all agreed that indemnity should be
                        demanded for the losses of all Chinese who were during the recent trouble in
                        the employ of foreigners.</p>

                        thereafter appointed elsewhere or honored and promoted. The case of Yü

                        least to control and police the city and vicinity. Besides, the weather will
                        soon be too inclement for them to travel; so that the probability is that we

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have learned that the allied forces at
                            Paoting Fu killed the provincial treasurer of Chihli, Ting Yung, and
                            others, in all six men. I have also learned that the foreign soldiers
                            have gone to various districts, imprisoned and killed various
                            magistrates. Although the reports in the foreign press say that the
                            treasurer, Ting, had connived at and tolerated the “Boxers,”
                            nevertheless since August he certainly repented of his past deeds and
                            dispatched soldiers to exterminate the “Boxer” bandits. Further, when
                            the foreign soldiers went to Paoting Fu and the various districts, the
                            treasurer did not lead his troops against the foreign soldiers, but went
                            outside of the city to receive them and presented them with oxen and
                            wine. It may be said that he certainly treated them kindly. Nothing was
                            said beforehand that it was the purpose of the foreign forces to kill
                            the treasurer, and, further, no explanation was made as to the crime he
                            committed and a request made to China to deal with him herself. This can
                            only cause foreigners to be treated with contempt, and still further
                            give rise to a feeling of hatred in the future. It will be difficult for
                            the Chinese officials to open their mouths in having any control in
                            arranging peace, and they will be very much harassed. The Government of
                            the United States is known to be equitable, sincere, and to do what is
                            right, and desires China to exercise complete sovereign rights. This
                            question was brought to the attention of the foreign powers by the
                            United States, and it was agreed that China should herself deal with the
                            leaders in this calamity. The action taken at Paoting Fu is at variance
                            with the views of the United States, and this, I believe, the United
                            States will agree to. The matter, however, is finished, and it is not
                            necessary to thoroughly discuss it. What we are anxious about is that
                            the foreign soldiers are still moving about in many directions, and it
                            is not known what may happen. I ask you to consult with Mr. Conger and
                            request the United States Government to use its best endeavors with the
                            foreign powers to prevent them from again using their military power, so
                            that the minds of the people may be set at rest and avoid further
                            complications; that help may be offered to accomplish a settlement of
                            terms of peace, and then enable China to get out of the difficulty. The
                            people will then not harbor any feeling of resentment. A speedy
                            settlement will enable the merchants and farmers to resume their

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Confirming my telegram of this date, I have
                        the honor to report that while the military expedition of the allied forces
                        were at Pao-ting Fu a court of inquiry was organized, and five Chinese
                        officials were tried, and three of them sentenced to decapitation, viz: Ting
                        Yung, the provincial treasurer, who, at the time of the murder of the
                        missionaries last July, was provincial judges Kuei Heng, the chief Tartar
                        official of the city, and Wang Chang-kuei, a lieutenant-colonel of the
                        Chinese army, who, with his command, stood idly by while the murders were
                        committed.</p>
                    <p>The present provincial judge, Shen Chia-pen, was recommended to be degraded
                        and to be kept under military restraint until the appointment and arrival of
                        his successor.</p>
                    <p>The tao-tai, T’an Wen-huan, was recommended to be sent to Tientsin for
                        trial.</p>
                    <p>The sentences were approved by Field Marshal Count von Waldersee, and on the
                        6th instant the three first were duly executed.</p>
                    <p>For their connection with and gross negligence in the presence of the
                        atrocious butchery of the helpless missionaries these men richly deserve the
                        punishment inflicted; but, under all the circumstances, and in view of the
                        present negotiations for a settlement, I apprehend a wiser course would have
                        been to hold the prisoners for execution by the Chinese authorities, under a
                        peremptory demand by the powers.</p>
                    <p>The whole movement has greatly frightened the court, and will make its early
                        return to Pekin more difficult and less probable.</p>
                    <p>It was known to the allied forces sending out this expedition that orders had
                        been previously given by Li Hung-chang to the Chinese soldiers to make no
                        resistance, and the provincial and city officials at Pao-ting Fu were
                        instructed to come out and meet them and give them a friendly reception. * *

                        the decree therein mentioned. The punishments are all grossly inadequate,
                        and by no means commensurate with the crimes. Prince Tuan, the chief patron
                        of the Boxers, and the responsible leader of the movement, is only stripped
                        of his titles, and banished (?) to Moukden, the capital of Manchuria. The
                        other princes are treated still more leniently. The two members of the
                        Tsungli Yamen, Ying Nien, and Chao Shu-chiao, who were also patrons of the
                        Boxers and directors of their movements, are simply degraded, but remain in
                        their high offices. Yü Hsien is punished a little more severely, but since
                        he himself is responsible for the commencement of the Boxer movement in
                        Shantung, and later for the murder of our missionaries in Shansi, and of
                        which he, as governor of that province, boasts, nothing but death is a fit
                        punishment for him. * * *</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to confirm your telegram of
                        the 16th instant.</p>
                    <p>When we reach the matter of reformation of the Tsung-li Yamen I will present
                        the requirement that the minister for foreign affairs shall be able to speak
                        some foreign language. But I fear this will limit the choice to a very small
                        number of mostly young men, and preclude the selection of the stronger,
                        better educated men of China. * * *</p>
                    <p>We are discussing the question of Peking as a treaty port, but in order to
                        reach an agreement on the preliminary demands I fear this will have to be
                        deferred to a later period in the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>As to the demand for posthumous honors, I have conferred with my colleagues
                        and I find that this, too, must come later in the negotiations, if at all.
                        With the exception of Chang Yin-huan, it is not known how thoroughly the
                        others interested themselves in foreigners or foreign affairs. So far as our
                        relation with them at the tsungli yamen was concerned, their friendship
                        toward foreigners was notable only in contrast with the intense antiforeign
                        sentiments of their colleagues.</p>
                    <p>I will urge the agreement upon a lump sum for indemnity at the proper time,
                        and think if that plan can be adopted it will expedite final settlement. I
                        have from the start tried to make the preliminary demands as general and as
                        simple as possible, in order to avoid asking impossible terms which might
                        defeat the purposes aimed at. I have been afraid that if we demand in the
                        beginning the death of all the strong men surrounding the court their
                        execution will be impossible, because there will be nobody to perform the
                        work, and it is hardly to be expected they will execute themselves.</p>
                    <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0055"/>
                    <p>General Tung Fu-hsiang has command of all the troops with the court, and is
                        practically master of the situation, and I have urged my colleagues to leave
                        his name out of the first demand, so that he might carry out the imperial
                        order for the execution of the others; but my colleagues are unanimous in
                        their insistence that in view of the leading part he and his troops have
                        taken in the whole antiforeign movement, his name must be included in the
                        very first demand, and, if the impossibility of compliance is made evident,
                        some different arrangement can be made as the negotiations progress.</p>
                    <p>You will observe from this that the word “ultimatum,” which I have used in my
                        telegrams, is not to be taken in its usual sense of meaning a fixed period
                        within which demands must be complied with or hostilities will begin, but
                        rather as an irrevocable decision, with a sort of mental reservation, that,
                        in case of meeting actual impossibilities, it may be slightly changed. We
                        have found it rather difficult to secure an agreement of the ten ministers
                        upon all points, so several compromises have had to be made. We have,
                        however, finally agreed in principle upon all the points named in my
                        telegrams, except the one which requires China to agree to adopt such
                        financial measures as the powers may indicate, to guarantee the payment of
                        the said indemnities, and the interest on the public loan. * * *</p>
                    <p>I fully appreciate the importance of a speedy termination of negotiations.
                        Trade is at a standstill. The revenues of China are falling off at the rate
                        of half a million dollars per month; the expense of these great armies is
                        adding so rapidly to her liabilities that soon it will be impossible for her
                        to pay. Practically all missionary work is suspended, the business of our
                        manufacturers and exporters at home is suffering, and unexpected internal
                        disturbances may rise to further complicate matters at any time. Yet I think
                        no settlement should be made that is not reasonably comprehensive, with an
                        assurance of permanency, and adequate guaranties for the future.</p>

                        so plainly a world-wide question, and the necessity of strengthening our

                        and yourself justly deem so important, I have felt myself authorized to sign
                        a joint note, and shall do so if all the other ministers are so authorized.
                        If not, we will send in identic notes.</p>
                    <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0056"/>
                    <p>The agreement of the Russian minister to the last paragraph of demand No. 5
                        was obtained by employing the words “measures acceptable to” instead of
                        “indicated by the foreign powers.”</p>
                    <p>There have been some concessions made by each minister, in order that we
                        might reach an agreement. In consequence the demands are not exactly in
                        accordance with the letter of your instructions, but are as near with their
                        spirit as seemed possible to come to an agreement upon. I tried to have no
                        names mentioned in connection with the death penalties, simply saying “all
                        those mentioned in the decree of September 25, and such others as should be
                        designated.” Then I tried to have the name of Tung Fu-hsiang left out, in
                        order to have him and his soldiers to punish the others. I also urged the
                        dismantling, instead of razing, the Taku forts. But I was almost alone on
                        all these propositions, and to have insisted upon them would have delayed
                        indefinitely the negotiations. Therefore, in order to facilitate
                        negotiations and secure the agreement of my colleagues to other important
                        propositions, so that negotiations might begin, I yielded on these. If,
                        therefore, the Governments all approve and authorize their representatives
                        to sign, we ought to be ready to meet the Chinese plenipotentiaries in a
                        very few days.</p>
                    <p>Besides the commercial and other reasons for an early beginning of
                        negotiations heretofore mentioned, it is important in order to stop the
                        military excursions being continually made into the interior by the European
                        troops. In my judgment most of these are not necessary, and are greatly
                        injuring the prospects of any satisfactory settlement.</p>
                    <p>Although the note as inclosed has been definitely agreed upon, it is possible
                        that by the direction of some of the Governments changes may be necessary.
                        Should this, however, occur I will immediately inform you.</p>

                            serious disturbances broke out in the northern provinces of China, and
                            crimes unheard of in human history, crimes against the laws of nations,
                            against the laws of humanity, and against civilization were committed
                            under particularly odious circumstances. The principal of these crimes
                            were the following: <list>

                                    the exercise of his functions by soldiers of the regular army

                                    these attacks being continued without interruption until the
                                    14th August, on which date the army of foreign troops put an end
                                    to them. These [attacks] were made by regular troops who joined
                                    the Boxers and who obeyed orders of the court emanating from the
                                    imperial palace. At the same time the Chinese Government was
                                    declaring officially through its representatives near the powers
                                    that it guaranteed the security of the legations.</item>

                                    assassinated, tortured, or were attacked by Boxers and regular
                                    troops, and only owed their salvation to their determined
                                    resistance. Their establishments were pillaged and

                        <p>These events led the foreign powers to send their troops to China to
                            protect the lives of their representatives and their nationals and to
                            restore order. In their march on Peking the allied forces met with the
                            resistance of the Chinese armies and had to overcome it by force.</p>
                        <p>China having recognized its responsibility, expressed its regrets, and

                            enumerated below, which they deem indispensable to expiate the crimes

                            regrets of the Emperor of China for the murder.</p>

                            been desecrated and in which the tombs have been destroyed.</p>

                        <p>5. Equitable indemnities for the governments, societies, and individuals,
                            as well as for the Chinese who have suffered during the late events in

                            foreigners.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose copy of two
                        communications which I addressed to the peace commissioners on the 19th and
                        27th of November, respectively. Identic notes were also sent by my
                        colleagues.</p>
                    <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0058"/>
                    <p>The first was sent because it was considered by the diplomatic body that in
                        view of the active part taken by Tung Fu-hsiang in the attempt to massacre
                        all foreigners in north China, and the bad influence he was exerting through
                        his military power, it was no place for him to be near the court.</p>
                    <p>The second refers to honors conferred on Li Ping-heng and his son and
                        grandson, as will be seen by the two decrees inclosed herewith. Li Ping-heng
                        has always been notorious for his hatred of foreigners and everything
                        foreign. He was governor of Shantung in 1897, when the murder of the two
                        German missionaries occurred, which led to the seizure by Germany of the
                        port of Kiao-chao. He was degraded two steps, and transferred to another
                        post. This sentence, by the wording of the decree, could not be commuted in
                        any way. During the siege he arrived in Peking, and was largely instrumental
                        in bringing about the death of the six Chinese ministers who were favorable
                        to foreigners, and who were decapitated by Imperial decree. His antiforeign
                        spirit was so marked and his sympathy with the Boxer movement so intense
                        that the diplomatic corps regarded the action of the court in conferring
                        upon him and his relations marks of Imperial favor calculated to mislead
                        public opinion, and they thereupon entered a protest by identic note, as
                        will be seen by inclosure No. 2.</p>

                            among the Imperial decrees, bearing date September 20, one conferring
                            rank and privileges on a son and grandson of the late Li Ping-heng “as
                            an indication of sincere regard for loyal and faithful service, a regard
                            which is boundless and ever increasing.”</p>
                        <p>That His Imperial Majesty should duly reward loyal and faithful service
                            is but meet and proper. In the present case, however, the fact of his
                            using language such as that of the decree in question and a former one,
                            issued immediately after the death of Li Pin-heng, eulogizing him and
                            conferring posthumous honors on him, might mislead public opinion by
                            inducing the Chinese people to believe that, while ostensibly
                            negotiating with the powers for a renewal of the former friendly
                            relations, the advisers of His Majesty continue to cherish the same
                            hostile sentiments which have made the late Li Ping-heng so
                            notorious.</p>
                        <p>It is needless for me to dilate on Li Ping-heng’s record, his well-known
                            antiforeign spirit, the incidents which marked his progress northward,
                            the added vigor which he infused into the attack on the legations, his
                            complicity in bringing about the death of high officials favorable to
                            Europeans, and, last of all, his death, fighting to oppose the advance
                            of troops seeking to save the lives of ministers and subjects of nations
                                <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0059"/>with whom His Imperial
                            Majesty professed to be at peace. Such being the case, it is my duty
                            most energetically to protest against the issue and publication of
                            decrees of this kind, and I have to request you to be good enough to
                            make representations in this sense, and to intimate that I request that
                            such decrees are not published for the future.</p>

                                the Peking Manuscript Gazette November 3, 1900.</hi></head>
                        <p>Li Ping-heng, assistant generalissimo of the Wu-Wei army corps, formerly
                            governor-general of Szechuan, was personally a pure and upright man. He
                            showed himself a public-spirited and loyal officer in the administration
                            of public affairs. He commenced his official career as a magistrate, and
                            advanced to the highest rank. Wherever he held office he stopped abuses
                            and punished the avaricious. He respected and loved to consider the
                            feelings of the people. We had just promoted him to be governor-general
                            of Szechuan, when, on account of certain affairs (Chan-tung missionary
                            case), he was degraded and transferred to another post. On account of
                            illness, however, he took home leave.</p>
                        <p>Last year he was received in audience, and, fortunately, he had regained
                            his health. We then appointed him to proceed on a mission of inquiry to
                            Moukden. Afterwards we sent him as inspector of naval affairs on the
                            Yangtze River, and he instituted reforms and put everything in proper
                            working order. On the commencement of military operations we called him
                            to Peking. In spite of the heat he hurried on the journey north, and on
                            arrival received our commands to lead our troops. He had just arrived at
                            the place he was to defend, when he found the country in a state of
                            excitement over the war. He did not achieve any good results, but this
                            was owing to the fact that the forces under his command had not been in
                            training for any length of time, and the officers were unable to render
                            any good services. We did not blame Li Ping-heng for losing in battle.
                            We now learn that his troops were defeated in battle and retired, and on
                            the 11th of August he committed suicide at Chang-Chia Wan, near Tung
                            Chou. Although no memorial has been presented to us regarding his death,
                            still the report that has come to us may be taken as reliable. Words are
                            inadequate to express how grieved we are over the news of his death.</p>
                        <p>Let Li Ping-heng have conferred upon him such favors as are by law
                            prescribed for governors-general, and all bad marks against his name are
                            hereby remitted. Let the yamen concerned look up the code and report to
                            us any other marks of favor that should be bestowed upon him. Further,
                            as an extra act of imperial favor, let a posthumous title be conferred
                            upon him and sacrifices be made in the Chao-chung Ssu. Ting Yung is
                            hereby appointed to offer libations to the spirit of the dead officer.
                            Let the local officials make all necessary arrangements when the body is
                            conveyed to its native place.</p>
                        <p>Permission is given for the corpse to be conveyed into Peking. Let the
                            military governor at Moukden ascertain whether the deceased left any
                            relations in official life and report to us, so that we may confer on
                            them some marks of our Imperial favor as an indication of our regard for
                            a loyal officer.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to confirm, as inclosures
                        herein, your cipher telegram of the 27th ultimo, and mine of the 4th
                        instant.</p>
                    <p>The latter is the full text of the note including the demands which the
                        ministers have unanimously agreed upon to be sent to the Chinese
                        plenipotentiaries. You will observe that several changes have been made in
                        the demands as originally sent to you; the most important of them in
                        compliance with your telegram, and agreed to by a majority of my colleagues
                        only because I strenuously insisted upon them, and in order not to greatly
                        endanger negotiations by further unnecessary delay. AH the ministers, except
                        the Russian and British, had been instructed to sign the note as it was. The
                        British minister had not yet received definite instructions, and the Russian
                        minister had been instructed to sign only on condition that the death
                        penalty was left out. I therefore had the active assistance of these two and
                        the Japanese minister, and have been working with the others ever since the
                        receipt of your telegram.</p>
                    <p>A meeting was called, at my suggestion, on yesterday. Upon the question of
                        substituting the words “severest punishment” for “death penalty,” the
                        German, Austrian, and Italian ministers voted “No,” but agreed that when it
                        came to signing the note they would sign the changed note. The death penalty
                        having been stricken out, it was thought by a majority of the ministers that
                        there could not be serious objection to the use of the word “irrevocable” in
                        the preamble; but I insisted that it should go out, and, instead of
                        referring to the conditions as “irrevocable,” we would say “absolutely
                        indispensable;” and finally all agreed that if my Government would not give
                        way on this point, they all would, for the sake of harmonious and immediate
                        action, agree to the change. But the German, French, Austrian, Italian,
                        Spanish, and Belgian ministers very much preferred to retain the word
                        “irrevocable,” and begged me to ask my Government to yield. I promised to
                        telegraph you the facts and await instruction.</p>
                    <p>Their principal reasons for insisting upon the word “irrevocable” were that
                        any change would weaken our case and encourage the Chinese, and that by
                        retaining the word there would be far less danger of quibbles and delays on
                        the part of the Chinese; and that, with the words “death penalty” stricken
                        out there was no danger in leaving the word “irrevocable” in. Besides, they
                        all insisted that it was not used in the sense of an ultimatum. However,
                        whether or not you insist upon its being stricken out, the note will be
                        signed as soon as I hear from you. I am presuming that the British minister
                        will by that time have received his instructions. Everything is so chaotic
                        here and unexpected conditions so likely to arise at any moment that further
                        delay is very dangerous. So many concessions have been made and so many
                        changes agreed to by the several ministers that now, having reached a
                        possible agreement, advantage should be taken of it and the matter
                        closed.</p>
                    <p>The British minister is expecting to-day his instructions to sign. When he
                        does receive them, they will be only waiting for me. I hope, therefore, very
                        soon to receive your telegraphic approval of and authority to sign the
                        note.</p>

                        received by telegraph. They have had three months in which to procure the
                        fully authenticated documents themselves, and it is a great surprise to us
                        all that they have them not. They have, however, promised to telegraph to
                        the court a copy of the letters patent issued to Li Hung-chang for
                        negotiations with Japan, and request the issuance of like powers now.</p>
                    <p>This morning I received from Prince Ching and Li Hung-chang a communication,
                        copy of which I inclose, setting forth another telegraphic decree granting
                        them full powers, and they again promise that when negotiations begin they
                        will be able to present full powers, duly sealed and properly
                        authenticated.</p>
                    <p>This decree is also published in the Official Gazette to-day.</p>
                    <p>It is therefore probable that satisfactory evidence of their full authority
                        to act will be forthcoming in time to prevent serious delay in the
                        negotiations.</p>

                        30 last, with reference to the removal of General Tung Fu-hsiang with his
                        baneful influence and inordinate power, from the immediate Vicinity and
                        control of the court, I have the honor to inclose herewith translation of a
                        communication received from Prince Ching and Li Hung-chang, embodying an
                        Imperial decree ordering him to Kansuh; and disbanding 5,500 of his

                    <p>There is in this action a pretense of punishment, but it can in nowise be

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: We had the honor, some time
                            ago, to receive your excellency’s note, in which you observed that
                            General Tung Fu-hsiang should not be near the court, etc.</p>
                        <p>We at once memoralized the Throne, setting forth the observations made by
                            your excellency, and on the 3d of December a decree was issued as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“Tung Fu-hsiang, general of Kansu, formerly rendered meritorious service
                            in the successive battles he waged against the Mohammedans in Kansu.
                            After his transfer to Pekin he showed ignorance of the condition of
                            affairs existing between China and foreign countries, and failed to
                            respectfully sympathize with the Court’s sincere purpose of cultivating
                            friendly relations (with the powers). Whenever questions came up he
                            generally treated them in an abrupt, careless manner, and it is right
                            that he should be severely punished; hut taking into consideration that
                            (matters in) the province of Kansu are of great importance, and as the
                            said general is certainly the right man in the right place there, we
                            will treat his offense leniently, and order that he be deprived of his
                            rank but allowed to retain his office. Of the various troops under his
                            command we have ordered that 5,500 be dismissed. We further order that
                            the said general, with the various battalions of his bodyguard or own
                            forces, at once return to Kansu and there take up a commanding or
                            strategical position and establish defenses, so that we may see whether
                            he exerts himself.”</p>
                        <p>As in duty bound we inclose the above decree for your excellency’s
                            information.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose herewith copy of
                        my telegram of the 16th instant, and to say that this suggested change comes
                        as a great surprise from the British Government, because we have believed it
                        fully appreciated the necessity of, and was as anxious for, early
                        negotiations as any of us.</p>
                    <p>The British minister had agreed to the terms of the note as I telegraphed it
                        to you, and believed himself authorized to sign, but preferred to wait
                        formal authorization. Hence my former telegram to you saying that all of my
                        colleagues were waiting for me.</p>
                    <p>The British minister Insists that the idea of his Government in suggesting
                        the additional paragraph, “Until the Chinese Government has complied with
                        the above to the satisfaction of the powers, the undersigned can hold out no
                        expectation that the occupation of Peking and the province of Chihli by the
                        general forces can be brought to a conclusions” is to limit the scope of
                        possible ulterior operations to the continued occupation of Peking and the
                        province of Chihli only, and so alleviate in part the rigor of the apparent
                        ultimatum in the word “irrevocable.”</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>As stated in my telegram, the German and Russian ministers have already
                        agreed to the addition, and all the others, except the Japanese <pb n="57"
                            xml:id="pg_57" facs="0063"/>minister, who is waiting a reply to telegram
                        sent to his Government yesterday, have since signified their willingness to
                        accept the addition.</p>
                    <p>Most of my colleagues construe this British amendment rather in the nature of
                        a promise to withdraw the troops from Peking if the Chinese Government does
                        comply with our demands. If, therefore, the Chinese Government so
                        understands, and properly appreciates the situation, and earnestly desires
                        an amicable settlement, and will, without delay, accept the terms submitted
                        by the powers, and at once set about compliance therewith, the execution of
                        nearly all the demands can either be fully accomplished or such progress
                        made toward that end as will justify the withdrawal from Peking of all the
                        troops except the actual legation guard, and the return of the Court to the
                        capital. It will be impossible for the troops to withdraw before spring, and
                        equally impossible for the Imperial Government to come hither before that
                        time. It never can nor will come while the troops remain.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime the criminals named can be punished; satisfactory
                        arrangements can be made with the German and Japanese Governments for
                        sending the missions and erecting the expiatory monuments proposed; the Taku
                        forts can be razed or arrangements made therefor; formal decrees can be
                        issued covering other points, and all may be done from Sian Fu, leaving for
                        future adjustment practically only demands Nos. 6 and 11; that is, questions
                        of indemnities, requisite financial measures, and the necessary amendments
                        to the treaties of commerce and navigation. These are the most important of
                        all, and can not be settled at once. They can be much more equitably,
                        satisfactorily, and speedily settled by a conference of the powers, either
                        in Europe or America. * * *</p>
                    <p>The question of withdrawing the troops from Peking is a most important one,
                        and will soon confront us. For the benefit of China, as well as in the
                        interest of all the powers, it should be accomplished at the earliest
                        possible date. * * * It seems, therefore, that it would be advantageous if
                        such preliminary communication might be had with the strong powers as would
                        prepare the way for telegraphic orders for the immediate withdrawal of
                        troops when the proper stage in the negotiations shall be reached.</p>
                    <p>It would undoubtedly be necessary to continue considerable foreign force in
                        China some time yet; that is, until negotiations are completed; though by no
                        means the large armies now here. This force, however, ought to be located
                        where it will have the least possible contact with the Chinese people, and
                        interfere in the least possible way with Imperial or local control of
                        Chinese affairs, or the execution of Chinese laws. It should simply remain
                        in China to insure the completion of satisfactory and promised negotiations,
                        or for emergencies possible to arise while China is getting back to normal
                        conditions.</p>
                    <p>I write this dispatch at this time in anticipation and for the better
                        understanding of probable telegraphic communications likely to be made later
                        on.</p>

                        had insisted to the end of opening up the whole question again.</p>
                    <p>I regret exceedingly the error in the transmission of your cipher telegram of
                        the 5th instant. But for this all the late trouble and misunderstanding
                        would have been avoided. As it arrived and was understood here, it
                        instructed me to sign the note as the majorities desired—that is, retaining
                        the word “irrevocable.” It is true this did not make a correct grammatical
                        construction, and for this reason its repetition might have been requested;
                        but it was such a direct reply to the inquiry, in which I used the word
                        “majority,” that, after trying numerous other combinations, we had no doubt
                        that you intended for me to accede to the wish of the majority and retain
                        the word. This construction did not seem unreasonable, since I understood
                        your strongest opposition to the word grew out of its use in connection with
                        the demand for death punishments, the omission of which I had secured. As
                        further strengthening this view, I apprehended that you had concluded that
                        it was such a short step from “conditions absolutely indispensable” to
                        “irrevocable conditions” that the latter might be used instead of the
                        former. Hence, as I wired you, I immediately notified all my colleagues, on
                        the 7th instant, that my Government instructed me to accept the word
                        “irrevocable,” and we all believed the matter settled until the receipt of
                        your telegram of the 16th instant. In the meantime all my colleagues had so
                        wired their Governments, and none of them were willing, unless compelled to
                        do so, to telegraph for further instructions. I therefore feel certain that
                        your permission to sign, although reluctantly given, has greatly facilitated
                        negotiations. I also hope and believe that no serious trouble can come from
                        the retention of the word “irrevocable.”</p>
                    <p>A meeting of the ministers was held yesterday afternoon, in which I again
                        clearly stated to my colleagues that my statement to them on the 7th
                        instant, that my Government had agreed to the retention of the word
                        “irrevocable,” was a mistake, resulting from an error in the transmission of
                        a telegram, and that, on the contrary, you had been opposed to the word from
                        the beginning, and still believed its use unwise, as apparently equivalent
                        to “ultimatum;” but that in order not to unnecessarily delay or imperil
                        negotiations, you had authorized me to sign the note with its retention. I
                        therefore signed, and it was decided to request Prince Ching and Li
                        Hung-chang to meet us at the Spanish legation at 10 o’clock a.m. on Monday,
                        the 24th instant, when it will be presented to them.</p>

                        <p>During the months of May, June, July, and August of the present year,
                            serious disturbances broke out in the northern provinces of China and
                            crimes unprecedented in human history—crimes against the law of nations,
                            against the laws of humanity, and against civilization—were committed
                            under peculiarly odious circumstances. The principal of these crimes
                            were the following: <list>

                                    minister, proceeding to the tsungli yamen, was murdered while in
                                    the exercise of his official duties by soldiers of the regular
                                    army, acting under orders of their chiefs.</item>

                                <item>The same day the foreign legations were attacked and besieged.
                                    These attacks continued without intermission until the 14th of
                                    August, on which date the arrival of foreign troops put an end
                                    to them. These attacks were made by regular troops, who joined
                                    the Boxers, and who obeyed orders of the court, emanating from
                                    the; Imperial palace. At the same time the Chinese Government
                                    officially declared by its representatives abroad that it
                                    guaranteed the security of the legations.</item>

                                <item>The 11th of June Mr. Sugiyama, chancellor of the legation of
                                    Japan, in the discharge of an official mission, was killed by
                                    regulars at the gates of the city. At Peking and in several
                                    provinces foreigners were murdered, tortured, or attacked by
                                    Boxers and regular troops, and only owed their safety to their
                                    determined resistance Their establishments were pillaged and
                                    destroyed.</item>

                                <item>Foreign cemeteries, at Peking, especially, were desecrated,
                                    the graves opened the remains scattered abroad. These events led
                                    the foreign powers to send their troops to China in order to
                                    protect the lives of their representatives and their nationals,
                                    and to restore order. During their march to Peking the allied
                                    forces met with the resistance of the Chinese armies and had to
                                    overcome it by force. China having recognized her
                                    responsibility, expressed her regrets, and manifested the desire
                                    to see an end put to the situation created by the disturbances
                                    referred to, the powers have decided to accede to her request on
                                    the irrevocable conditions enumerated below, which they deem
                                    indispensable to expiate the crimes committed and to prevent

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that En Hai, a
                        Manchu soldier belonging to the Peking field forces, who was arrested in
                        September, charged with having murdered the German minister, Baron von
                        Ketteler, on the 20th of June last, was publicly beheaded on the 31st ultimo
                        by the German military authorities, on the same spot where the murder was
                        committed.</p>
                    <p>According to En Hai’s statement, which can not, however, be relied upon, he
                        was placed in charge of a corner of the Hata street and one of the side
                        streets leading toward the Tsungli Yamen, having under him some 30 men. At
                        about 4 o’clock on the afternoon of the 19th of June he received a verbal
                        order of a prince to shoot all foreigners passing along the street. The
                        order was such an unusual one that he considered it his duty to return to
                        the camp and consult with his superior officer, who confirmed the order. He
                        stated that while he did not know the name of the particular prince who had
                        issued the order, he was quite sure it had been issued with the knowledge of
                        his commanding genenal, Prince Ching. He also said that the order was
                        directed against foreigners in general, not against the Germans or ministers
                        in particular. On the morning of the 20th, when he saw the chairs of the
                        minister coming up the street, he ordered his guard to load their pieces,
                        and upon the near approach of the chairs fired himself, when the firing
                        became general. A revolver was afterwards found in the chair, with one
                        chamber empty. The body of the minister was dragged into a side alley and
                        left there until buried, a few days later. The clothing was not removed, nor
                        the remains otherwise maltreated.</p>

                        my telegram of the 1st instant, and your reply of the 3d, and to say that
                        the impracticability <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0069"/>of

                        various treaty amendments, becomes each day more apparent.</p>
                    <p>The principle by which war expenses are to be assessed or estimated ought to
                        be uniform, and can only be made so by an agreement between the powers
                        incurring such expenses. * * *</p>
                    <p>Financial measures to be adopted, and how much, if any, foreign supervision
                        shall be given, can best be discussed where the powers interested can be
                        more quickly and intelligently consulted and conferred with than is possible
                        here.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose herewith copy of
                        the note in which the Chinese plenipotentiaries, embodying the Imperial
                        decree, notified us of the acceptance of our demands, and requested that a
                        date be fixed for the discussion of all questions.</p>
                    <p>It was the unanimous opinion of all the ministers that this was an absolute
                        acceptance of our demands, but since the demands were not set out either in
                        the decree or the note of the plenipotentiaries, we decided, in order to
                        prevent any future misunderstanding or discussion, to require the signatures
                        of the Chinese plenipotentiaries to a protocol setting forth in detail the
                        demands, together with their letter of acceptance, after which we would be
                        ready to discuss with them the questions of detail connected with the
                        demands. This protocol was prepared in both French and Chinese, and a copy
                        sent to them to be signed and returned to each minister. A copy of the
                        decree of acceptance, which they had set out in their note, was also
                        requested for each minister, duly authenticated by Imperial seal. A copy of
                        this protocol will be transmitted in my next dispatch.</p>
                    <p>The protocol was not delivered to the Chinese plenipotentiaries until the 7th
                        instant, In the meantime we were privately informed by them that * * * the
                        Emperor had by another decree forbidden them to accept the demands without
                        certain changes were made. Prince Ching and Li Hung-chang have telegraphed a
                        strong protest against this last decree, and are awaiting a reply.</p>
                    <p>It will not do to abate one jot or tittle until these demands are formally
                        and, so far as the Chinese are concerned, irrevocably accepted. If after
                        that, in the discussion of details, some minor concessions are found
                        necessary, they may be made.</p>
                    <p>The question of dismantling instead of razing the Taku forts may be taken up.
                        It is also thought best not to touch upon the question of stopping military
                        excursions into the interior until the above-mentioned protocol is signed.
                        As soon, however, as it is formally signed attention will be given to this
                        latter matter.</p>

                            foreign ministers plenipotentiary personally handed to us the treaty in
                            12 articles which, after just consultation, they have adopted. We, the
                            prince and minister, submitted by telegraph to the Throne the complete
                            text of the Chinese translation, and on the 28th of December we received
                            the following decree, dated 27th of December:</p>
                        <p>“We have duly perused Prince Ching’s and Li Hung-chang’s telegram, and it
                            behooves us to agree to the whole of the 12 articles.”</p>
                        <p>As in duty bound we, the prince and the minister, send this communication
                            to your excellency and beg that you will in turn transmit it to your
                            colleagues. We have also to request that a time and place be fixed for
                            an interview to discuss all questions. We beg that you will favor us
                            with a reply.</p>
                        <p>The above articles having been agreed to by the Chinese Government, we
                            would also further request that until evacuation by the troops takes
                            place no further expeditions be undertaken by the troops of the powers
                            to the departments and districts, to the end that the minds of the
                            people maybe pacified and relations of friendship strengthened.</p>

                        January 12 and 16, respectively.</p>
                    <p>This protocol was described in my dispatch, No. 495, of the 8th instant. It
                        is being printed with the minutes of the meetings of the plenipotentiaries,
                        and will be transmitted as soon as it can be obtained.</p>
                    <p>On the 16th instant each foreign minister received from the Chinese
                        plenipotentiaries the protocol which we had prepared, duly signed and
                        sealed; a copy of the decree accepting our demands, bearing the imperial
                        seal, and a memorandum containing various suggestions and questions
                        concerning our demands, by the Chinese plenipotentiaries. I inclose copies
                        of translations of the decree, the memorandum, and the brief notes
                        transmitting them. The foreign representatives are to meet on Tuesday, the
                        22d instant, to determine upon the replies to make to the inquiries and
                        suggestions of the Chinese. The latter have totally misconceived the meaning
                        of the final clause of our demands, if they expect the withdrawal of the
                        troops upon the simple acceptance thereof. They must proceed in good faith
                        with the execution of them. We ought, as soon as possible, name the persons
                        and the punishments which must be inflicted, and insist upon their immediate
                        accomplishment. We can not, of course, determine absolutely just what
                        particular persons the Chinese Government is able to execute, but I feel
                        quite sure that the death of all of those heretofore mentioned, except
                        possibly Prince Tuan, Duke Lan, and General Tung Fu-hsiang, can be
                        accomplished. I am further convinced that the prompt and severe punishment
                        of a very few high responsible officials will have vastly more effect upon
                        the Chinese than that of hundreds of lesser criminals. I shall, therefore,
                        in accordance with what I understand to be your instructions, endeavor to
                        have as many as possible of the leading responsible officials, whose
                        punishment may be reasonably certain to be within the ability of the
                        Government, selected, and their punishment demanded.</p>

                    <p>As to article fifth, concerning the prohibition of arms and materials used
                        exclusively in the manufacture of arms and ammunition, I think a general
                        reply may be made to their suggestions that the limit of the period for its
                        enforcement must depend upon the ability and willingness exhibited by the
                        Chinese in restoring and preserving order, and in the protection of
                        foreigners and their interests, and can not be fixed at present, but the
                        Chinese Government may be assured that the powers have no desire to
                        unnecessarily continue the prohibition.</p>
                    <p>Their requests to have named the points for military occupation between the
                        capital and the sea, and the number of legation guards, may be replied to in
                        the same general way, to wit, that it is not possible to definitely fix them
                        now, but that it will all depend upon the ability and action of the Chinese
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>Information concerning the forts to be destroyed and the size of the legation
                        quarters can be furnished as soon as determined upon. The military
                        commanders have been asked to furnish a report upon both these
                        questions.</p>

                    <p>The several Imperial decrees demanded should be issued at once. This done,
                        and the punishments accomplished, the general forces might be withdrawn from

                        financial measures proceeded with. The revision of the treaties can wait

                            the Imperial seal on the 14th instant, for your keeping. We may explain

                            Government officers. The imperial seal used on the decree in the present

                            made to friendly powers.</p>

                            diplomatic body, a communication in which he says that as soon as the
                            foreign plenipotentiaries shall have received the decree, duly sealed
                            with the imperial seal, and the protocol with our signatures they will
                            hasten to indicate the earliest possible date for the meeting which we
                            have requested. Further, they will be gratified if we will before that
                            meeting make known in writing the questions which we desire to propound,
                            in order that an understanding as to the replies to be made can be

                        <p>On the 24th of December, 1900, we received and perused the treaty, in
                            twelve articles, drawn up, after joint consultation, by the foreign
                            ministers plenipotentiary. This document affords ample evidence of a
                            genuine feeling of friendliness on the part of the powers toward
                            China.</p>
                        <p>Each article therein contained was by us telegraphed to the Emperor, and
                            his majesty thereupon issued a decree by telegraph, stating that it
                            behooved him to accept in their entirety the principles laid down in the
                            twelve articles submitted.</p>
                        <p>Later on, on the 7th of January, we received a protocol from each of the
                            foreign ministers, together with a communication from Monsieur de
                            Cologan, requesting that prior to the next conference we put forward in
                            writing the points which we might wish to discuss, so that the
                            plenipotentiaries could arrive at an understanding with regard to the
                            answer to be made to us on the occasion of our meeting.</p>
                        <p>We accordingly, in compliance with the terms of the original Imperial
                            mandate, have appended to the protocol transmitted to us our signatures
                            and signs manual, and returned the same.</p>
                        <p>As China has complied with and signed the treaty presented by the foreign
                            representatives, to the satisfaction of the powers, the forces at
                            present in occupation of Peking and the province of Chihli should, in
                            accordance with the terms of the final clause, of course, be withdrawn.
                            It is of essential importance that, pending their withdrawal, hostile
                            operations should cease, movements of troops be suspended, and no
                            further military expeditions proceed into the different department and
                            district cities and towns, harrying the country, and exciting alarm
                            among the populace.</p>

                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Article I</hi>. The case of the German
                                minister, Baron von Ketteler, action as therein laid down will be

                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 2. The Imperial decree of September
                                25, 1900, herein cited, already provides for the punishment of the
                                princes and other high officials concerned. As, however, the note
                                still pressed for severer punishment, it is, of course, our duty to
                                address to the Throne a request that they be punished with
                                additional severity—the punishment, as stated in the article, to be
                                “in proportion to their crimes.” The article further calls for a
                                suspension of all official examinations for five years in all the
                                cities and towns where foreigners have been massacred or have been
                                subjected to cruel treatment. With regard hereto we would observe
                                that the cities and towns in each prefecture, subprefecture,
                                department, and district are very numerous. It will be necessary to
                                ascertain in what cities and towns foreigners have been massacred or
                                subjected to cruel treatment, when, of course, action as laid down
                                will be taken. This provision evidently applies to the Sui and Ko
                                examinations. (Annual examinations for students—hsiu-tsai’s or
                                licentiates—held in the various prefectural and district towns by
                                the literary chancellor of the province.) As regards the provincial
                                and metropolitan examination, these are collective examinations for
                                each province. Should there be in a province cities or towns where
                                foreigners have been massacred or subjected to cruel treatment,
                                separate inquiry as above mentioned ought to be made and action
                                taken accordingly. In other cities and towns not in any way
                                implicated examinations ought to take place as usual. Such course of
                                procedure will serve us as an exhortation and warning.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 3. In the case of Mr. Sugiyama,
                                chancellor of the Japanese legation, action as therein laid down
                                will be taken.</item>

                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 5. Maintenance, under conditions to
                                be settled between the powers, of the prohibition of the importation
                                of arms, as well as of material used exclusively for the
                                manufacturing of arms and ammunition. We would point out that in the
                                interior of China local banditti are to be found everywhere, and,
                                what is more, they carry firearms and weapons of a similar nature,
                                mostly clandestinely imported from abroad. Unless the Chinese
                                soldiers told off to hold them in check are armed with efficient
                                weapons, it would be difficult to maintain order; and should these
                                banditti create disturbances and make trouble, traders and others,
                                Chinese or foreign, can hardly avoid being injured thereby. We would
                                accordingly request that some fixed term of years be agreed, upon
                                the expiry of which purchases as heretofore would be allowed.
                                Material for the manufacture of the munitions of war consist of many
                                different kinds, and as far as those which are indispensable for
                                governmental use are concerned, the Tsungli Yamen ought, on giving
                                notice in writing, to be permitted to purchase the same as occasion

                                measures acceptable to the powers for the purpose of guaranteeing
                                payment of the indemnities.</item>
                            <item>In assessing the indemnities China’s resources must, in our
                                opinion, be taken into account, and a broad and comprehensive grasp
                                of the entire situation is imperative. Either some extended limit of
                                time must be granted within which to make payment, or, after a
                                careful review of the circumstances of the case, a reduction of the
                                amount demanded must be taken into consideration. China’s annual
                                receipts and expenditures are well known to the powers, and the
                                present indemnities constitute an extraordinary addition to her
                                other liabilities. We therefore venture to express the hope that the
                                neighboring nations will, with one accord, give their consent to the
                                adoption of any measures which China may bring forward with a view
                                to creating additional revenue, such as an increasing of the customs
                                tariff, a raising of the mining duties, an universal postal system,
                                the introduction of a stamp duty, all already in universal operation
                                throughout other countries.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 7. Maintenance by each power of a
                                legation guard and the defense of the legation quarter in which
                                Chinese shall not have the right to reside. As far as the guards are
                                concerned we would earnestly beg that a fixed number be decided upon
                                and minute regulations for keeping them under control be drawn up,
                                so that they may not stir up trouble outside of their own lines. As
                                regards the legation quarter, where does it commence and where does
                                it end? Such yamens and public offices as are therein situated ought
                                to be left as they are. A boundary line should be laid down so that
                                notice to remove can be served to Chinese inhabitants of the
                                proposed quarter.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 8. Unimpeded communication between
                                Peking and the sea. Investigation as to what forts impede such free
                                communication ought to be made, and a decision as to ordering their
                                demolition be arrived at.</item>
                            <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0074"/>
                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 9. Military occupation of certain
                                points to be determined by an understanding between the powers for
                                keeping open communication between the capital and the sea.</item>
                            <item>A preliminary consultation between the powers as to how many men
                                of each nation are to be employed for the purpose, what the total
                                number is to be, and what separate points are to be occupied, should
                                take place, and the result be communicated to us. Further, the
                                powers should draw up regulations for keeping the troops under
                                control, so that no cause for alarm be afforded to the inhabitants
                                in the country round about. Such troops shall be sent solely for the
                                protection of foreign officials and merchants; they will have
                                nothing whatever to do with Chinese territory or Chinese
                                travelers.</item>
                            <item>The Chinese Government will continue to take every precaution to
                                insure the protection of foreigners, and on no account furnish them
                                with cause to apprehend a severing of communications between the
                                capital and the sea. If, after the lapse of a year or so, and a
                                review of the circumstances of the case, the powers shall have found
                                that China’s protection has proved effectual, the question of
                                withdrawing the foreign troops of occupation might be taken into
                                consideration.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 10. The responsibility on the part
                                of all provincial officials, civil and military, high and low, of
                                affording protection to foreigners, in their respective
                                jurisdictions, and their permanent removal from office in the event
                                of their not immediately suppressing any antiforeign disturbances
                                which may break out, or their failing to punish the guilty. The
                                territorial authorities of China, as a matter of fact, have on
                                repeated occasions had their responsibility as regards the
                                protection of foreigners impressed upon them by imperial decrees.
                                Should, therefore, hereafter any disturbances break out resulting in
                                loss of foreign life, or in bodily injury to foreigners, those
                                concerned must, of course, be severely dealt with in accordance with
                                law. The recent troubles, however, are of a truth to be ascribed to
                                lack of friendly feeling between Christians and non-Christians.
                                While on the one hand these troubles afford ground for indicting
                                past action, they on the other hand furnish a warning for the
                                future, and emphasize the necessity of framing a policy whereby
                                permanent mutual harmony between the two classes may be insured. In
                                order to avoid the continual occurrence of cases arising out of
                                religious differences, which render life to the people unbearable,
                                and result in a never-ending list of impeachments as far as the
                                officials are concerned, a special article should, after joint
                                consultation, be drafted, embodying detailed rules conceived in a
                                spirit of equity.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 11. The Chinese Government will
                                undertake to negotiate the amendments to the treaties of commerce
                                and navigation considered useful by the powers, and upon other
                                subjects connected with commercial relations.</item>
                            <item>Any amendments which the powers may consider useful are naturally
                                put forward with a view to promoting their own interests and those
                                of China in equal measure. To propose such as would curtail China’s
                                privileges, injuriously affect the means of livelihood of the
                                traders, or decrease her customs revenue, would certainly not be the
                                desire of the powers. China must naturally, therefore, undertake to
                                regulate any amendments with respect to commercial or any other
                                matters which will tend to! secure mutual advantages.</item>

                                ceremonial relative to the reception on the part of His Majesty the

                                deem necessary, they should bring them up when the time comes, and
                                then, after mutual discussion, arrive at a decision.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The above is merely a discussion of the purport of the note handed to us
                            by the foreign representatives, in which discussion we have incorporated
                            a detailed expression of our views. Nothing has been added to the note,
                            nor altered therein. Should no objection be offered to this statement of
                            our views, after it shall have been jointly considered by the foreign
                            representatives, it should be appended to the original text of the note,
                            and together the result form the basis of the treaty to be negotiated
                            hereafter.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the last paragraph of the note, on the subject of the
                            withdrawal of the forces in occupation of Peking and the province of
                            Chihli, we would request that as speedily as possible the question of
                            complete evacuation on the part of the troops stationed in Peking,
                            Paoting, Tientsin, and Tung Chou will be taken into consideration, and a
                            date fixed upon for carrying out the same. This does not apply to the
                            legation guards at Peking, nor to such posts as it may be deemed
                            necessary to establish between the capital and the sea to maintain free
                            communications.</p>
                        <p>The palace precincts, city walls, public offices, storehouses, and
                            granaries in Peking, Tientsin, Paoting, and other places at present held
                            by them, should likewise all be handed back to the Chinese
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The friendly feeling toward China which animates the foreign
                            representatives gives us an assurance that they will accede to this
                            request, and take steps to have it complied with.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that on the 22d
                        instant the foreign ministers met and agreed upon the reply to be made to
                        the “memorandum” of the Chinese plenipotentiaries, which was transmitted to
                        them on the 24th instant. I inclose copy and translation. We followed the
                        lines suggested in my dispatch No. 506, and I believe that to hold these
                        matters undetermined will afford us a very effective weapon with which to
                        induce the Chinese Government to make an early compliance with our demands,
                        and to impel them to such action as will facilitate a favorable termination
                        of negotiations.</p>
                    <p>The question of punishment was taken up at this meeting and continued on the
                        24th, but early in the latter meeting the sad news of the death of the Queen
                        of England was received, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
                    <p>The British minister informed us on the 22d instant that his Government had
                        instructed him to insist upon the death penalty for all persons mentioned in
                        the decree of September 25, 1900, and for General Tung Fu-hsiang and
                        Governor Yü Hsien. The names of Prince I, Tsai Lien, and Tsai Ying were
                        mentioned in the decree, but none of us have any information concerning
                        them, and therefore it was not deemed wise to demand any additional
                        punishment for them. Prince I is already reported dead. The Russian,
                        Japanese, and Belgian ministers and I believe it impossible at present to
                        secure the death penalty for Prince Tuan, Duke Lan, or Tung Fu-hsiang, and
                        therefore opposed making such demands. It is to be hoped that the British
                        minister’s instructions may be modified so that we may very soon unanimously
                        agree upon the persons and punishments to be demanded. In connection with
                        the punishments it has been decided to demand some sort of posthumous honors
                        for the four proforeign members of the Tsungli Yamen, Hsü Ching-cheng, Hsü
                        Yung-i, Lien Yuan, and Yuan Chang, and Li Shan, President of the Board of
                        Revenue and Comptroller of the Imperial Household, who were summarily
                        executed a short time before the arrival of the relief expedition. I tried
                        to get Chang Yin-huan’s name included in this list.</p>

                            of the opinion that, in signing the note and transmitting the Imperial
                            decree, you have conformed sufficiently to the conditions which have
                            been imposed, and that you are now in position to formulate several
                            desiderata. Such is not the scope of the conditions which have been sent
                            to you.</p>

                        <p>In order that the foreign representatives may hold that the Chinese
                            Government has conformed, to the satisfaction of the powers, to the
                            conditions imposed, acts are necessary, not mere formal acceptance. With
                            this in view the foreign representatives beg to call your special
                            attention to articles 2 and 10, respectively, which concern the
                            punishment of the guilty, the publication and posting of edicts intended
                            to repress and prevent disturbances against foreigners. You will very
                            shortly be requested, in pursuance of the desire which you have
                            yourselves expressed, to attend a meeting at which the demands of the
                            Governments on these points will be clearly defined.</p>

                            representatives to consider them will depend on the good will which the
                            Chinese Government will manifest by their acts, its resolution to comply
                            with the conditions which have been agreed to by His Majesty the

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to confirm your telegraphic
                        instructions of the 29th ultimo, concerning indemnities. We have not reached
                        this subject yet in our meetings, and in private conversations most of the
                        ministers claim not to have received instructions. The German minister
                        informs me that he thinks that his Government will not be willing to agree
                        to a lump sum, nor will it agree to any scaling down of its claim. He says
                        they have already expended about $45,000,000, and the amount is rapidly
                        increasing. It is believed here (and the belief is shared by Sir Robert
                        Hart, the Inspector-General of Custom) that China can pay from $250,000,000
                        to $300,000,000. But unless the settlement is made soon, or an agreement is
                        made to scale down the claims, even this amount will be grossly
                        insufficient.</p>
                    <p>The outlook, therefore, for a speedy settlement of the question of
                        indemnities is not very favorable. It will be taken up as soon as the
                        question of punishments is out of the way.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the subject of indemnities and in trying to devise every
                        possible means of increasing the revenue, it is proposed to increase the
                        custom duties. The import duties are now nominally 5 per cent ad valorem,
                        but in fact are only about 3½ per cent. It is conceded by most of the
                        foreign merchants that this tax might safely be doubled; but just what
                        increase of revenue that would produce can not be definitely told. Some of
                        my colleagues are in favor of arranging for this increase at once—i. e.,
                        with the settlement of indemnities; others think it should be taken up only
                        with the subject of treaty revision, the latter claiming that if import
                        duties were increased now for the special purpose of raising revenue to pay
                        indemnities to foreigners, the Chinese generally would say and believe that
                        we were paying our own indemnities to ourselves.</p>
                    <p>I should like to receive special instructions upon this question, if it has
                        not been settled by telegraph before the receipt of this dispatch.</p>
                    <p>The question of the opium, salt, likin, and other taxes, as well as that of
                        cutting off the rice tribute and enormous gratuities paid to the Manchus,
                        and other means of increasing revenue, will all have to be taken into
                        account and disposed of as best we can agree upon them.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to say that a meeting of the
                        foreign representatives with the Chinese plenipotentiaries was held on the
                        5th instant to give the latter an opportunity to be heard on the question of
                        punishments, as set forth in our demands.</p>
                    <p>In order that all might agree to what should be said a brief indictment in
                        each case was prepared for the doyen to read, copy of which I inclose. As
                        the meeting was only intended for a verbal conference a copy of the
                        indictment was not delivered to the Chinese plenipotentiaries.</p>
                    <p>They said it would be impossible to execute Prince Tuan or Duke Lan, but they
                        would agree to their banishment for life to Turkestan. They said Prince
                        Chuang would be ordered to commit suicide; that Yü Hsien would be executed;
                        that General Tung Fu-hsiang had already been degraded, and that when it
                        could be accomplished he would be more severely punished; that he is very
                        popular in Kansu, and that any attempt to deal harshly with him would cause
                        an uprising among the people, etc. * * *</p>
                    <p>As to the others, they insisted that their crimes were not so great or so
                        well proven as those mentioned above, and hence some lighter punishment
                        should be inflicted. Reply was made that even the least of the criminals
                        deserved death, and, as that was the severest punishment which could be
                        inflicted, the death penalty was demanded for all. They averred that it
                        would be most difficult for the court to comply with our demands, and it was
                        placing them in a most trying position, and begged the ministers not to
                        create unnecessary difficulties for them. They did not hesitate to fix the
                        main responsibility for the crimes committed on the same persons that we had
                        named, nor try to shield the Chinese Government from its responsibility.</p>
                    <p>We had added the names of Chi Hsiu, a member of the Tsung-li Yamen and
                        President of the Board of Rites, and Hsü Cheng-yü, formerly junior
                        Vice-President of the Censorate, for reasons set forth in the indictment.
                        These two men are now held in confinement by the Japanese forces in this
                        city.</p>
                    <p>Much desultory conversation was indulged in between the Chinese
                        plenipotentiaries and some of the ministers, but of little importance and
                        without utility. We all had the impression, however, that so far as possible
                        our demands would be complied with.</p>
                    <p>In the afternoon of the same day the foreign ministers met, and, after much
                        discussion and with the general opinion that we should not give way further
                        to the Chinese, finally unanimously agreed upon the persons and punishment
                        set forth in the note herewith inclosed and which was sent to the Chinese
                        plenipotentiaries.</p>
                    <p>The English minister, and the German and some others following, has been
                        insisting upon demanding the death penalty for Prince Tuan and Duke Lan, but
                        finally he consented that if in any way capital sentence could be recorded
                        against these men, even if immediately commuted, he would agree to it. A
                        Chinese formula was found which seemed to fit the case and which, it was
                        believed, would be accepted <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0078"/>by the
                        Court. Demand was made in accordance therewith. It was as follows, as will
                        be seen by the note inclosed: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Prince Tuan and Duke Lan are sentenced to imprisonment awaiting
                                decapitation, but if immediately after this sentence the Emperor
                                desires as an act of grace to preserve their lives, they will be
                                sent to Turkestan, to be there imprisoned for life, with no further
                                commutation of punishment ever to be made in their favor.</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>For the present we accept the Imperial promise as to Tung Fu-hsiang. Prince
                        Chuang’s suicide will be accepted. For Ying Men, Chao Shu-chiao, Yü Hsien,
                        Chi Hsiu, and Hsü Cheng-yü the death penalty is demanded, and for Kang Yi,
                        Li Ping-heng, and Hsü Tung, who are already dead, posthumous punishments.
                        For the four members of the Tsung-li Yamen, Yuan Chang, Hsü Yung-i, Hsu
                        Ching-cheng, and Lien Yuan, and Li Shan, formerly President of the Board of
                        Revenue and Comptroller of Imperial Household, who were beheaded last summer
                        because they actively opposed the criminal madness of the Government in its
                        attack upon the foreigners, we demand posthumous honors, as per copy of note
                        inclosed.</p>
                    <p>As soon as the French minister receives further information from the interior
                        for which he is waiting we shall present another list of the provincial
                        officials who were accomplices in or responsible for massacre or cruel
                        treatment of missionaries and demand their punishment.</p>
                    <p>With reference to the demand for posthumous honors mentioned above, and as
                        showing how eminently they are deserved, I inclose a translation of three
                        memorials of Yuan Chang and Hsü Ching-cheng urging the Government to stop
                        its efforts to exterminate foreigners, punish the responsible officials, and
                        save the Empire. For this advice they were beheaded.</p>

                            representatives have informed you of the names of the persons who are
                            particularly responsible for the crimes committed at Peking and the
                            punishments which they judge proportioned to their crimes. They have

                            point. The object of this dispatch is to inform you of the definite
                            resolution which they have taken on the subject, and without prejudice
                            to those cases which will be brought to your notice later and which are
                            in regard to those officials who have committed crimes in the
                            provinces.</p>

                            believes he ought to spare their lives, they will be transported to
                            Turkestan in order to be imprisoned there for life, without any further
                            commutation of punishment whatever being pronounced in their favor.”</p>
                        <p>Ying Nien will be condemned to death. If Kang Yi were living he would be
                            condemned to death. Being dead all legal consequences of such punishment
                            will be decreed against him.</p>
                        <p>Chao Shu-chiao will be condemned to death. The foreign representatives
                            agree with you as to the decapitation of Yü Hsien.</p>
                        <p>In regard to Tung Fu-hsiang the foreign representatives note the
                            assurances which you have given them on the subject of the punishment to
                            be inflicted upon him later. <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0079"/>They

                            ought to be deprived of his command as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>If Li Ping-heng and Hsü Tung were living they should be condemned to
                            death. As they are dead, all legal consequences of such punishment will
                            be decreed against them.</p>
                        <p>Hsü Cheng-yü. and Chi Hsiu will be condemned to death.</p>
                        <p>The foreign representatives are of the opinion that the decrees
                            promulgating these resolutions should be issued immediately. As to the
                            executions, which should follow with the least possible delay, they
                            expressly reserve to themselves the verification by delegates whom they
                            will direct to be present at Peking or in the provinces.</p>
                        <p>You will appreciate the moderation of these demands, which show to what
                            extent your observations have been taken into account. For the
                            punishment of the murder of a minister, of a chancelor of legation, an
                            attack of two months directed by the Imperial troops against the foreign
                            settlements, the religious missions, and the representatives of the
                            powers, the premeditated attempt to ambuscade all the foreigners on the
                            road from Peking to Tientsin in order to massacre them, the execution of
                            those high officials who have protested against the outrageous
                            violations of international law in their memorials to the Throne, the
                            criminal acts which have resulted in the death of numerous victims, the
                            punishments demanded are a trifle.</p>
                        <p>In the name of all my colleagues I beg still further to again call your
                            attention to the final clause of the note which has been delivered to
                            you and the allusion to it in my dispatch which was given to you January
                            26, 1901.</p>
                        <p>It is indispensable that China grant immediately these first atonements
                            if she desires that the foreign representatives be in a position to
                            examine the military questions to which you have called their attention
                            in your memorandum of January 16.</p>

                            already informed you of the resolutions adopted by the foreign
                            representatives with reference to the persons more particularly
                            responsible for the crimes which have been committed at Peking and the
                            punishments which ought to be inflicted.</p>
                        <p>In the note which I sent you on that subject reference is made to the
                            high officials of state who have been executed for having memorialized
                            the Throne protesting against the outrageous violations of international
                            law which have taken place in China during the past year.</p>
                        <p>I have to advise you that since an act of reparation and justice can only
                            be made effective by the expressed assent of the Chinese Government, the
                            foreign representatives have decided that Hsü Yung-yi, Hsü Ching-cheng,
                            Yuan Chang, Lien Yuan, and Li Shan should be immediately restored to
                            their former honors. You will be notified later on if there are any
                            provincial officials who have been executed under the same conditions
                            which, were the cause of the adoption to-day of the resolutions which
                            have been brought to your notice.</p>
                        <p>The foreign representatives therefore request that you will memorialize
                            the Throne for a decree restoring the names of the five high officials
                            which I have just given you at the same time as the decree for the
                            punishments demanded by my note of to-day.</p>

                        <p>These decisions apply to the culprits who I am about to enumerate, adding
                            to the name of each one of them an abstract of the responsibilities
                            which they have incurred.</p>

                        <p>Prince Chuang has been officially commander in chief of the Boxers; has
                            performed from the 21st of June the duties of prefect of police; has
                            consequently the principal share of responsibility in the publication of
                            the notice bearing the seal of the prefecture which promises rewards
                            therein of between 30 to 50 taels to Chinese who shall capture
                            foreigners alive (men, women, and children), and which punishes with
                            death whoever shall protect foreigners. He has furnished their
                            headquarters in his own palace, in which native Christians have been
                            executed.</p>
                        <p>Prince Tuan has been the principal instigator of the Boxer movement, into
                            which he has dragged the Chinese Government, persuading it that it was
                            the best means of delivering China of all foreigners. He was appointed
                            president of the tsungli yamen after having given this advice to the
                            Chinese Government, and he is in particular responsible for the edicts
                            which were made against foreigners between the 20th of June and the 10th
                            of August, 1900. Among these decrees figures that of the 2d of July, the
                            carrying out of which had for a consequence the massacres in the
                            provinces, and especially in Shansi. He ordered his troops concurrently
                            with those of General Tung Fu-hsiang to attack the legations.</p>
                        <p>He always opposed the advice given by various members of the tsungli
                            yamen and by high mandarins looking to a cessation of hostilities.</p>
                        <p>He directed the party which secured the execution of four members of the
                            tsungli yamen, of a minister, and of several other mandarins accused of
                            being favorable to foreigners.</p>
                        <p>He is universally recognized as the author of the ultimatum sent on the
                            19th of June to the members of the diplomatic corps to convey to them
                            the order to leave Peking in twenty-four hours.</p>
                        <p>He is also recognized as having ordered, even before the expiration of
                            this delay, the firing on every foreigner in the streets of the
                            capital.</p>
                        <p>He may be considered under this point of view as the principal author of
                            the assassination of Baron von Ketteler.</p>
                        <p>Duke Lan was one of the official chiefs of the Boxers, in whose name he
                            made several proclamations, exercised the functions of the
                            vice-president of police, and took part in that capacity in the
                            publication of a decree promising rewards to Chinese who should capture
                            foreigners alive, (men, women, and children), and which punished with
                            death whoever should protect foreigners. He is also considered as having
                            been one of the first to open the gates of the city to the Boxers, whom
                            he went out to meet.</p>
                        <p>Ying Nien. He was, like Chuang and Lan, one of the official chiefs of the
                            Boxers, and signed in that capacity their principal notices. He as
                            vice-president of police rendered himself accomplice of the criminal
                            machinations of this administration, and took considerable part in the
                            antiforeign movement.</p>
                        <p>Kang Yi. He was one of the instigators and counselors of the Boxers, whom
                            he always protected at court, and to whom he was particularly
                            instrumental in securing complete liberty of action. He showed himself
                            to be one of the officials the most hostile to any understanding and to
                            the reestablishment of peaceful relations with foreigners. Sent at the
                            commencement of the month of June to meet the Boxers, under pretext of
                            deterring them from entering the city, he, on the contrary, encouraged
                            them to follow up their work of destruction, and became, like Duke Lan,
                            Prince Tuan, and Ying Men, one of their official chiefs. He signed in
                            this capacity their principal notices. He prepared a plan of expulsion
                            and annihilation of foreigners in the provinces of the Empire.</p>
                        <p>Chao Shu-chiao was, as member of the Grand Council and minister of
                            justice, and as a result of the considerable influence which he wielded
                            in the councils of the Throne, one of the leaders of the undertaking
                            against the foreigners. He urged the Chinese Government to leave perfect
                            freedom of action to the Boxers and to furnish them means of action. He
                            has special responsibility for the execution of the officials killed
                            during the siege for having tried to stop the attacks against the
                            legations. He went at the beginning of June to meet the Boxers, to whom
                            he promised his help, freely tendering them his encouragement.</p>
                        <p>Yü Hsien brought to life again and reorganized the society of Boxers; is
                            the author of the massacres in Shansi, assassinated with his own hand
                            foreign missionaries, made himself noticed by his cruelty, and vaunted
                            himself of his crimes, which stained with blood the whole province of
                            which he was governor-general.</p>
                        <p>Tung Fu-hsiang prepared with Prince Tuan and carried out at Peking the
                            plan for the annihilation of the foreigners in China, commanded the
                            attacks which his troops, united with the Boxers, made against the
                            legations. His soldiers assassinated the chancellor of the legation of
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>Li Ping-heng used his influence to have the Boxers recognized as a loyal
                            and patriotic sect, and led the Government to use them with the object
                            of exterminating all foreigners.</p>
                        <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0081"/>
                        <p>Intrusted with a special mission in the valley of the Yangtze, where he
                            had been sent as an Imperial commissioner, he appears to have prepared a
                            plan for the annihilation of foreigners in that region.</p>
                        <p>He besieged from the 27th of July the legations with the troops which he
                            had brought from Kiang-su, and later on he fought against the allied
                            armies marching on Peking.</p>
                        <p>Hsü tung has always been one of the officials the most hostile against
                            the foreigners, of whom he advised the extermination. He associated
                            himself with all measures destined to attain this end. He praised the
                            Boxers, of whom he never ceased to be the accomplice, and whom he
                            supported with all his influence as a high personage of the Empire and
                            tutor of the heir presumptive.</p>
                        <p>Hsü Cheng-yu has the same responsibility as his father, in whose counsels
                            and acts he constantly participated; furthermore, he is the principal
                            author of the execution of the officials who had endeavored to stop the
                            attacks against the legations.</p>
                        <p>Chi Hsiu was one of the officials the most hostile to foreigners, and
                            used all his influence as member of the Tsung-li Yamen and as minister
                            of rites in the service of the Boxers. He associated himself with those
                            of his colleagues who used bloody reprisals against the party which
                            disapproved the attack of the legations.</p>
                        <p>The foreign plenipotentiaries have decided, in accordance with the terms
                            of the note which they handed your highness and your excellency, that
                            they would ask for all the personages whose responsibility I have
                            briefly stated “the severest penalty in conformity with their
                            crimes.”</p>
                        <p>You will understand after the explanations which have just been given you
                            that these personages deserve death.</p>
                        <p>When this question shall have been settled, the foreign plenipotentiaries
                            will have to indicate to your highness and your excellency the names of
                            the officials who, to their knowledge, have committed crimes in the
                            provinces, and the punishments which shall be inflicted on them.</p>
                        <p>I must, furthermore, at the present stage, beg your highness and your
                            excellency to please communicate to us before its publication, and to

                                denouncing the Boxers, date probably between June 16 and 20,
                                1900.</hi></head>
                        <p>Memorialist begins by stating that since the Boxer outbreak inside the
                            city on June 13 daily audiences have been summoned of the advisers of
                            the Throne, and the Empress Dowager, in anxiety for the welfare of the
                            State, has addressed questions to them, to which this memorial is
                            Yuan-ch’ang’s answer.</p>
                        <p>He traces the origin of the “I-ho-ch’uan” to a society of the same name
                            composed of Shantung and Honan brigands which was suppressed by Imperial
                            orders in the reign of Chia-ching (1808), together with the Eight
                            Diagrams’ Society, both offshoots of the White Lily Society. The
                            governor of Shantung, Yuan Shih-k’ai, in a statement prepared last month
                            in obedience to Imperial instructions, said that there could be no
                            question of encouraging the Boxers or of utilizing their services as
                            soldiers. The seditious nature of this organization and the falsehood of
                            their pretensions to invulnerability is demonstrated by the Ping-yuan
                            Hsien case in Shantung some years ago, where an alleged descendant of
                            the Ming dynasty and professor of magic arts was executed by Yü Hsien
                            for stirring up excitement; by the test to which certain Boxers near
                            Peking were put in 1894 when they offered their services to the Imperial
                            troops as invulnerable men, and by their more recent disorderly
                            proceedings and insurrectionary designs.</p>
                        <p>Memorialist refers to an audience he had of the Throne in December last,
                            when the Boxers were creating disturbances in Shantung, on the pretext
                            of their hatred of Christianity, on which occasion he denounced them as
                            a heterodox and troublesome sect, and advocated their immediate
                            suppression. Shortly after this Yuan Shih-k’ai took the matter
                            vigorously in hand and restored order in Shantung, his forcible action
                            making him the object of much abuse at first on the part of the ignorant
                            literati of Shantung, who afterwards came to believe in him and approved
                            his proceedings. The Tsungli Yamen had proposed to memorialize the
                            Throne for instructions to Yuan Shih-k’ai, but finding that he had the
                            work of suppression well in hand, they dropped the matter and did not
                            present the memorial.</p>
                        <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0082"/>
                        <p>Unfortunately, however, as Shantung became quiet, the movement spread
                            into Chihli, where the supineness and procrastination of the Viceroy Yu
                            Lu developed it into a great calamity. It is impossible for Yu Lu to
                            escape a heavy responsibility for his want of foresight at the
                            beginning. When Imperial officers were killed at Lai-shui, Yu Lu saw
                            that the Boxers were using the anti-Christian feeling as a cloak for
                            rebellious actions, and telegraphed a memorial strongly urging that they
                            should be dealt with by force of arms; but opinions at court were
                            divided and no decision was taken. The impunity accorded to them
                            emboldened the Boxers, and they seized Cho Chou, Yungching, and Pachou
                            in succession; they destroyed the railways and telegraphs which are the
                            property of the State and worth millions of money; and they burned
                            hundreds of missions and massacred the converts, rendering the
                            Government liable for huge indemnities.</p>
                        <p>As regards the accumulated feelings of hatred which exists between the
                            converts and the people, the local authorities, in obedience to the laws
                            of the realm ought, as a matter of course, to be impartial in their
                            decisions, looking only to the merits of the case and not making
                            distinctions between ordinary people and converts. They should on no
                            account allow ruffians to take the law into their own hands and redress
                            their own grievances. As it is, these rebels have had the audacity to
                            invade the capital, and there they are burning missions, attacking the
                            legations, destroying everything they please, shooting people, and
                            alarming the palace. On the 16th instant they destroyed by fire houses
                            of over a thousand families outside the Ch’ien Men, burning and
                            pillaging completely the most wealthy and prosperous quarter of Pekin.
                            Nine out of ten families have had to quit their houses and flee; all
                            shops are closed; there is no money to pay the army; and everywhere is
                            decay and ruin; and China is a laughing stock to other nations.</p>
                        <p>Memorialist next refers to the legation guards, only some 400 in number,
                            which he declares were brought up for self-protection on account of
                            genuine apprehension of violence from the anti-Christian Boxers. On the
                            12th instant the privy councillor, Ch’i Hsiu and other ministers of the
                            yamen went by command of the Empress Dowager to convey a reassuring
                            message to the legations and to inquire for the wives of the ministers.
                            The ministers, accepting with gratitude the gracious greetings of the
                            Throne, declared that the bringing up of the foreign troops was for the
                            protection of their lives, and had absolutely no political bearing; and
                            they solemnly swore that as soon as the trouble was over the troops
                            would be withdrawn. Memorialist submits that the only way to prevent
                            reenforcements from coming up is to clear the Tartar City of Boxers, and
                            thus restore peace to the people and confidence to the foreigners, China
                            must kill these rebels herself if she does not want foreign troops to
                            assist her to kill them.</p>
                        <p>Memorialist proceeds to develop the remedy he proposes. The present
                            failure to deal with the situation is due to a want of concentration in
                            the command and the shirking of responsibility from one authority to
                            another. He begs that the Grand Secretary Jung Lu may be invested with
                            full discretionary powers to restore order. Proclamations should be
                            issued that all rioters wearing red sashes and turbans, or carrying
                            weapons, setting fire to houses, or killing people may be put to death
                            if they offer resistance. Heavy rewards should be offered for the
                            capture of Boxer chiefs or others, dead or alive. Jung Lu should direct
                            operations from a central position and should have officers appointed to
                            carry out his orders in detail. For this purpose memorialist
                            recommends:</p>
                        <p>Fan Tseng-hsiang, Kuei-Ch’un, Wang T’ing-hsiang, Huang Kwei-chun, and
                            Ch’en K’uei-lun, acting governor of Peking, all of whom he speaks in
                            high terms.</p>
                        <p>Selected officers and soldiers from the Wu-wei army should be divided
                            into companies of 200 or 300 each for the work of restoring order. The
                            three south gates of the Tartar City should be closed to incomers and
                            the streets and temples cleared of Boxers. Intelligent officers should
                            be selected by the gendarmerie and the board of punishments to take
                            evidence shortly in cases of arrests, whereupon ringleaders should be
                            executed upon the spot and followers deported. When order is restored
                            Jung Lu should send in a memorial reporting the number of Boxers put to
                            death.</p>
                        <p>Dealing with the objection that the Boxers are too numerous to be
                            exterminated, memorialist remarks that if only the leaders are caught
                            and decapitated the courage of their followers will immediately
                            evaporate. He ridicules their alleged possession of magic arts and
                            invulnerability, referring to rebels with similar pretensions in the Han
                            and Mongol dynasties who were eventually beheaded; also to the number of
                            Boxers killed by the foreign soldiers on the evening of the 13th, and to
                            the 40 Boxers killed in the Shuai-fu lane. (Allusion is to the joint
                            British-American and Japanese raid on a Boxer temple on June 16.)</p>
                        <p>In conclusion memorialist again lays stress upon the absolute necessity
                            of drastic measures in dealing with the Boxers. The power of foreign
                            nations is great, their <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0083"
                            />resentment will be deep, and the vengeance they will exact will bring
                            about an inexpressible calamity. Unless China takes the work of
                            extermination in hand herself foreign troops will do it for her, which
                            would lead to a great bloodshed in the capital, and eventually to the
                            indiscriminate slaughter of good citizens and irremediable ruin. The
                            Grand Secretary Jung Lu is a loyal and patriotic statesman, and if he is
                            invested with the requisite authority he will soon succeed in solving
                            the present difficulties in international relations.</p>

                                Ch’ang.</hi></head>
                        <p>Memoralists venture to submit for the perusal of the Throne the following
                            secret memorial setting forth without reserve their humble views on the
                            present dissensions at home, aggressions from abroad, and daily
                            increasing anarchy, and urging the policy of protecting the legations as
                            the only means of preserving the Commonwealth.</p>
                        <p>Ever since the 24th of last moon (June 20), the day when the German
                            minister, von Ketteler, was shot by Boxers who met him on the street,
                            these brigands have been attacking the foreign legations. The Kansu
                            army, under the command of General Tung Fu-hsiang, has lent the Boxers
                            its support and has joined forces with them in a conspiracy of outrage.
                            Innumerable inhabitants of the district round the legations have been
                            involved in disaster on account of their proximity to the latter, and in
                            the East City the private houses of officers have been plundered and
                            almost entirely destroyed. Thus these brigands, as they made their
                            hatred of Christianity a pretext for extending their depredations to the
                            legations, so they have now made their attacks on the legations a basis
                            for extending them to officials and people. It is certainly an
                            unparalleled event in ancient or in modern times that a riotous army and
                            a riotous mob should be let loose to wanton in the very capital of the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>At the time when the brigands began their attacks on the legations
                            everyone said that the latter would be razed to the ground in a day, and
                            Tung Fu-hsiang several times reported that the legations had been
                            totally destroyed. Now, after more than twenty days, only a paltry few
                            of the foreign soldiers have been killed, while the bones and corpses of
                            the brigands are lying scattered all along Legation street. They used to
                            beguile people with incantations, boasting of magic arts which secured
                            them against rifle and artillery fire. Where are these arts now? Several
                            tens of thousand brigands have been attacking legations defended by
                            about 400 foreign soldiers, and after over twenty days have not
                            succeeded in breaking in. This is an exhibition of their skill forsooth.
                            Are we now to rely on their valor as men of mere flesh and blood to
                            secure protection against aggression?</p>
                        <p>But it may be said that the true I-ho-ch’uan (Boxers) are really able to
                            render good service to their country, whereas the Boxers who quarrel,
                            burn, and kill are all false Boxers who have joined the former. Then,
                            since the union of the true and false members of this organization has
                            resulted in such extreme disorder, and since the false members who have
                            been allowed to join have committed every kind of outrage, it is evident
                            that the true Boxers themselves are essentially a bad community.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, successive Imperial decrees have been issued strictly
                            forbidding the prosecution of feuds by armed violence, arson,
                            destruction, and pillage; and orders have been given to disperse the
                            Boxers and expel them from the city. But these brigands treat such
                            commands as idle words and continue to riot at their pleasure as before.
                            True and false alike show contempt for the laws of their sovereign; all
                            are senseless beasts, and their crime is unpardonable. The more they are
                            conciliated the more numerous they become; the more influence is shown
                            them, the greater grows their arrogance.</p>
                        <p>Memorialists requested in a former memorial that the Grand Secretary Jung
                            Lu should be especially intrusted with the duty of employing methods of
                            violence or of moral suasion as required, but their request was not
                            granted. Now, however, that the disorders have reached so critical a
                            pitch, they are bound at the risk of their lives again to set forth in
                            trembling their humble opinions for the information of the Throne. They
                            submit that according to the principles laid down in the “Spring and
                            Autumn Annals” (Confucius), when two nations are at war, the envoy is
                            not killed. By the international law of western powers a still greater
                            importance attaches to envoys as the representatives of their nations. A
                            slight to the envoy is a slight to his nation. If the Boxers are now
                            allowed to attack and destroy the legations, and to succeed in killing
                            the foreign ministers, the foreign powers will regard it as a gross
                            insult, will unite their forces, and will fight to the death to obtain
                            reparation. Though the number of foreign troops in Peking is limited,
                            there is no <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0084"/>limit to the number
                            of reenforcements that can be sent. For one nation to oppose all the
                            nations is in the humble opinion of memoralists a matter not merely of
                            victory or defeat, but of the existence or annihilation of the
                            nation.</p>
                        <p>The Government of China has now been in relations with foreign powers for
                            nearly sixty years, during which time the latter have been allowed to
                            propagate their religions throughout the country. The converts have been
                            in the habit of relying on the influence and support of the foreign
                            missionaries to oppress their fellow-citizens, and it has been
                            inevitable that there should be some officials who have put pressure on
                            the ordinary people in the hope of avoiding trouble, with the result
                            that the people in their resentment have become at enmity with the
                            converts. But all this is due to faulty administration on the part of
                            memorialists and other servants of the Crown, faults which have led to
                            the present disaster. The guilt they have incurred is indeed serious.
                            How can memorialists venture to allege that the enmity between
                            Christians and non-Christians is entirely the fault of the people? To
                            allow both sides to take into their own hands the redressal of their
                            grievances is to impair the prerogatives of the State. Suppose, for
                            instance, that in a village there was a quarrel between two families,
                            and the juniors and servants in fighting out their dispute set fire to a
                            neighbor’s house and killed his gatekeeper, the heads of the families
                            being unable to restrain them. In such a case the neighbor would
                            certainly not address his compliments to the juniors and servants, but
                            to the heads of the families. How could the latter reply that the matter
                            did not concern them because the juniors and servants were beyond their
                            control? This is taking a small matter to illustrate a great, but the
                            principle involved in both is the same.</p>
                        <p>Another consideration is this: Among the religious systems of the Western
                            nations one consists in the worship of “the Lord of Heaven” (Roman
                            Catholicism) and one in the worship of “Jesus” (Protestantism). The
                            Roman Catholic missionaries are called shen-fu (spiritual fathers) and
                            the Protestant missionaries are called mu-shih (pastors). The Boxers
                            make no distinctions between the religions, but call them both alike
                            “the foreign religions.” Again, Russia follows the religion of the Greek
                            Church and Japan follows Buddhism. Neither of these nations has ever
                            propagated their religions in the interior of China, but the Boxers are
                            entirely ignorant as to which nation has missionaries and which has not,
                            and speak of all who wear strange clothes and speak a strange language
                            as mao-tzu (“red-heads”). They take pleasure in hunting them all down
                            without discrimination, no matter what considerations of policy make it
                            inexpedient, what considerations of right and wrong make it
                            unlawful.</p>
                        <p>Consider, moreover, the position of the Chinese ministers abroad. They
                            are all stationed at their posts in pursuance of Imperial commands. If
                            the powers in uncontrollable anger on account of our killing their
                            ministers were to begin killing our ministers in revenge, this would be
                            nothing better than an exchange of swords for the slaughter of each
                            other’s representatives.</p>
                        <p>The Throne has just displayed its kindly feelings by sending vegetables,
                            rice, and flour to the envoys. But the aforesaid brigands, relying on
                            the support of their braggart general, continue their lawless attacks,
                            and foreigners are led to suspect that the court is making a show of
                            treating the legations with civility, while secretly screening their
                            assailants. If it is said that the latter are not acting under orders,
                            but are indulging in an orgy of cruelty of their own account, who will
                            believe this?</p>
                        <p>Now, if the legations do not come to harm, when friendly relations are
                            eventually resumed with the powers, the foreign ministers, having
                            accepted the gracious kindness of the Empress Dowager and the Emperor,
                            will not fail to give expression to their natural feelings of gratitude,
                            and will explain that the trouble was suddenly started by the Boxer
                            brigands before precautions could be taken, and was not due to any
                            leniency on the part of the Throne. In this way they will be able to
                            succeed in dispelling the suspicious fears of their governments; the
                            difficulty being halved, the good results will be doubled, and it will
                            be comparatively easy to restore the situation.</p>
                        <p>But if the legations fall and the envoys are killed, how will the outer
                            world ever learn of the kindness and consideration displayed at this
                            time by their Majesties the Empress Dowager and the Emperor? If we seek
                            to explain matters ourselves to the powers, though we should speak with
                            a hundred voices we should not succeed in excusing ourselves to their
                            satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>At the present time the powers are massing their troops on the pretext of
                            acting for China in the suppression of the brigands. The suspicious say
                            that they are surreptitiously taking advantage of this opportunity to
                            aim at usurpation, while those who believe them declare that they have
                            no ulterior motives. Memorialists do not profess to have sufficient
                            ability to fathom their intentions. But as for the Boxers, they are a
                            lawless crew in every respect. They ought long ago to have been
                            exterminated without waiting for the repeated requests of the
                            foreigners, and still more without waiting for the foreigners to
                            suppress them for us.</p>
                        <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0085"/>
                        <p>The humble requests of memorialists then are as follows:</p>
                        <p>Complete protection should be afforded to the foreign legations in order
                            to facilitate the future restoration of the status quo ante.</p>
                        <p>Also, stringent commands should be given to General Tung Fu-hsiang to
                            withdraw the whole of his Kansu army outside the city, and to forbid his
                            troops again approaching Legation street, or joining with their friends,
                            the brigands, in attacks upon the legations, on pain of immediate
                            execution. If once the soldiers and the brigands were separated, the
                            power of the latter would be reduced and the task of suppressing them
                            rendered comparatively easy.</p>
                        <p>Also, memorialists have again to beg that Grand Secretary Jung Lu be
                            intrusted with the task of expelling all Boxers from the city within a
                            prescribed limit of time in order to rescue the country from an imminent
                            peril, and that he should adopt measures for their complete
                            extermination in order to prevent future calamities.</p>
                        <p>Memorialists are well aware that, the heavens being now darkened by a
                            flight of locusts, disaster to themselves will follow their words; but
                            they are filled with the thought of the crisis of life or death to the
                            nation which is momentarily impending. Their own opinions are simple and
                            insignificant. They can not bear to speak, and yet they can not bear not
                            to speak. They therefore, regardless of their own lives, humbly submit
                            this memorial for the perusal of their Majesties the Empress Dowager and
                            the Emperor. (Undated. Evidently written between July 20 and 24,
                            1900.)</p>

                        <p>Memorial submitting to the Throne a secret statement of how certain high
                            officials, by encouraging magic arts, have injured the country and
                            brought calamity upon the people, and requesting that severe punishment
                            may be inflicted upon the instigators of the trouble, in order to check
                            the evil at its source and avert an impending peril.</p>
                        <p>It is now just over one month since the Boxer brigands started the
                            disturbances. The capital is shaken by earthquake and the four seas echo
                            to the shock. Armies have collected; disaster is ripening; the whole
                            world has been dragged into the strife; events of a nature unparalleled
                            in history have inevitably brought about a calamity equally without
                            parallel.</p>
                        <p>In the reign of Hsien Feng (1851–1862) the Fa Fei (long-haired rebels)
                            and the Men Fei (mounted banditti in the north) fought desperately for
                            over ten years and overran more than 10 provinces. Still longer ago, in
                            the reign of Chia-Ch’ing (1796–1821), the Chiao Fei (White Lily Society)
                            seized three or four provinces and usurped control for three or four
                            years, and reference to the military archives shows that at the time all
                            the military forces of the Empire had to be exerted to the utmost before
                            conquest could be effected.</p>
                        <p>But if we compare the troubles of the present day we see that all the
                            former ones were diseases of the extremities, and not like the Boxer
                            brigands, a disease that saps the very vitals. For in the case of the Fa
                            Fei, the Men Fei, and the Chiao Fei, everyone, from the Throne to the
                            hamlet, knew that they were rebels; but in the case of the Ch’uan Fei
                            (Boxers) of to-day, even high officials are deceived into looking upon
                            them as patriotic subjects and refuse to call them rebels; or there are
                            some who know they are rebels, but dare not treat them as rebels. Their
                            folly is such that they have excited not only the enmity, but the
                            derision of foreign nations.</p>
                        <p>When the Boxer brigands first set up their standard they had not the
                            resources of guns and rifles, or of training in military operations. All
                            they could do was to use the motto to “Support the dynasty; exterminate
                            foreigners,” as a rallying cry for hordes of worthless vagabonds, and to
                            set disturbances on foot. Had there been a single magistrate or military
                            officer of ability available, they might have been suppressed with the
                            utmost ease. But first the evil was fostered by Yü Hsien, ex-governor of
                            Shantung, and afterwards it was encouraged by Yu Lu, governor-general of
                            Chihli, who supplied the Boxers with arms, thus as it were giving wings
                            to a tiger.</p>
                        <p>What is the explanation of the motto “Support the dynasty; exterminate
                            foreigners?” If it means that men’s minds are imbued with a sense of the
                            abundant favors that have been showered upon them by our Government for
                            over two hundred years, and that therefore all who eat the produce or
                            tread the soil of China are bent on exerting their energies and making
                            speed to show their gratitude for the Imperial blessing, then the
                            expression may pass. But if it means that at this juncture, when the
                            state is troubled, when the times are critical and full of difficulties,
                            the uncultured masses have the power to give support in danger and to
                            restore order, then we must remember that to support is the opposite of
                            to upset, and that the power to support involves the power to upset.
                            Thus the intention implied is only too evident, and the expression of it
                            still more deserves the punishment of death.</p>
                        <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0086"/>
                        <p>Your memorialists, unworthy servants though they are, are well aware that
                            the intrusion of foreigners into the interior is certainly not for the
                            benefit of China. But it behooves us to reform the internal
                            administration of the country and to attend to the consolidation of
                            external relations; to see that we have a cause of quarrel before taking
                            action; and to choose among the nations one which it is within our power
                            to oppose, when at one stroke we can with dignity and composure avenge
                            our accumulated wrongs.</p>
                        <p>If when a foreign oppressor was invading us there arise any who are able
                            to display enthusiastic patriotism and insist upon the necessity of
                            resisting to the death, no matter what the measure of their ability
                            might be, memorialists could not venture to do aught but applaud their
                            spirit. But at a time like the present, when the nation is actually in
                            the enjoyment of friendly relations with the powers, to suddenly begin
                            to speak of “exterminating foreigners” is to provoke a quarrel upon a
                            false issue, and to become the laughing stock of the world.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, does the expression “exterminate foreigners” apply to the
                            foreigners who are in China, or does it include the foreigners of every
                            nation in the five continents? If it is only the foreigners in China who
                            are to be exterminated, it is impossible to prevent others from coming
                            in their place. And if it is all the nations of-the world that are to be
                            exterminated, then the foreigners are more than ten times as numerous as
                            the Chinese, and it does not require much wisdom to know whether or not
                            their extermination is possible.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the wisdom of Yü Hsien and Yu Lu, both high provincial
                            officers, did not reach as far as this. Yu Lu even invited the leaders
                            of the Boxer brigands and treated them as honored guests. A rabble of
                            hundreds of village ruffians and vagabonds had only to give themselves
                            the style of I-ho-t’uan (the militia of patriotic union) to be
                            immediately allowed to come in person into his yamen and to be treated
                            by the governor-general with every mark of consideration. Was not this a
                            slight to the throne and an insult to all the scholars of the
                            Empire?</p>
                        <p>Chang Te-ch’eng, Tsao Fu-t’ien, and Han I-li, Boxers of Ching-hai Hsien,
                            Wang Te-ch’eng, and others of Wen-an and Pa-chou, were all common local
                            bullies, ruffians who defied authority and banded themselves together to
                            make riots the plague of their districts. These men had been notorious
                            for a long time; there was not a man in the country side who did not
                            know their names, not even a resident in Peking who did not know them.
                            The aforesaid governor-general brought them all to the notice of the
                            throne in a public memorial, speaking of them in laudatory terms and
                            recommending them for employment. Never was there so flagrant a case of
                            deceiving the Sovereign.</p>
                        <p>Again, Yu Lu stated in a memorial that on the 20th day of the 5th moon
                            (June 16) about 7 o’clock in the evening the foreigners demanded the
                            surrender of the Taku forts; that the general, Lo Jung-kuang, stoutly
                            refused to comply; that both sides remained firm until about midnight,
                            when the foreigners opened the attack with artillery fire; that the
                            general offered valiant resistance and succeeded in sinking two of the
                            foreign ships at anchor; that on the 22d (June 18) the foreign soldiers
                            in the Tientsin settlement advanced in different directions and offered
                            battle; that the Chinese forces opposed them in every direction and
                            supported by detachments of the I-ho-t’uan (Boxers) attacked them with
                            the utmost vigor and burned a large number of houses in the settlement.
                            Now the memorialists have made inquiries of refugees who have arrived at
                            Peking from Tientsin, and these all declare that the sinking of foreign
                            ships and the burning of foreign houses actually never occurred, but
                            that the Chinese troops and Boxers were killed by the artillery of the
                            foreign powers to the number of not less than several tens of thousands.
                            Different voices all speak in the same sense; it is certainly not a mere
                            lying rumor.</p>
                        <p>There are even some who say that the attack of the Taku forts by the
                            foreign forces on the 16th of June was subsequent to the opening of
                            hostilities by Yu Lu, who gave orders to the Boxers to attack the
                            Tientsin settlement. This statement, however, may be merely the result
                            of Yu Lu’s unpopularity and can not be trusted implicitly.</p>
                        <p>At all events Yu Lu’s lying report of military operations is exactly on a
                            par with General Tung Fu-hsiang’s false statement that the legations had
                            been destroyed and the foreigners in them utterly wiped out.</p>
                        <p>Now Tung Fu-hsiang was originally a local robber of Kansu, who was forced
                            by the pressure of poverty to offer his allegiance, and having rendered
                            a certain amount of good service in his military career, was promoted
                            from the ranks by the Throne and thus attained his present position.
                            With what self-restraint and self-respect ought he to humbly seek to
                            requite such generous and gracious kindness. Instead of which this
                            bandit and traitor consorts with, thieves and robbers, and continues to
                            pursue his course of rebellious conduct. Not only does he show
                            ingratitude’ for the Imperial favors, but his savage, wolf-like
                            disposition gives cause to fear that he may bring about still further
                            calamity.</p>
                        <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0087"/>
                        <p>Yu Lu has held several high territorial commands, and is not to be
                            compared with a military officer like Tung Fu-hsiang. But nevertheless
                            his folly and ignorance have reached a pitch which surpasses all
                            expectation.</p>
                        <p>The truth is that both tried to fall in with the wild views of the
                            officials at the court, which they wrongly considered to be inspired by
                            their Majesties the Empress Dowager and the Emperor, and they were thus
                            induced to turn round and relapse into sedition recklessly and
                            unscrupulously. They were brought over, in fact, by the glozing deceits
                            and hoodwinking devices of the present court officials.</p>
                        <p>The grand secretary, Hsü-T’ung, is by nature a fool, and has no knowledge
                            of good and evil.</p>
                        <p>The privy councilor and assistant grand secretary, Kang Yi, associates
                            with traitors and encourages rebels. He follows blindly and obstinately
                            his natural disposition.</p>
                        <p>The privy councilor and president of the board of ceremonies, Ch’i Hsiu,
                            is obstinate and self-opinionated, ignorant and yet fond of using his
                            own judgment.</p>
                        <p>The privy councilor and president of the board of war, Chao Shu-ch’iao,
                            is bent on cunning and deceit, and skillful in playing the
                            sycophant.</p>
                        <p>At the time when the Boxers were entering the city, the princess, dukes,
                            and other metropolitan and prominent officials were summoned to the
                            Imperial presence and asked to pronounce for the policy of violent
                            methods or of conciliation. Memorialists thereupon replied to the effect
                            that the Boxers were not patriotic subjects, and could not be relied
                            upon to defend their country; and that hostilities could not be lightly
                            entered upon with foreign powers without due cause. Hsu-T’ung, Kang Yi,
                            and others had the audacity, in the presence of the Empress Dowager and
                            the Emperor, to stigmatize this language as seditious. Ah, if China’s
                            10,000 well-sharpened blades were but equal to the task of conquering
                            her enemies, would not memorialists’ life-long desire be to have the
                            whole of the latter collected in one place and to give the signal for
                            their destruction? But if they are not, if these critics are but
                            deceiving themselves and thus deceiving the country, the “seditious
                            language,” it is to be feared, is not on the part of your
                            memorialists.</p>
                        <p>In the month of June, Kang Yi and Chao Shu-ch’iao received Imperial
                            orders to proceed to Cho-chou and disperse the Boxers. The latter forced
                            them to kneel, and offer incense, and used language full of slanders and
                            falsehood. Chao Shu-ch’iao well knew that they were lying, but he only
                            muttered his disgust to the members of his staff, and afterwards,
                            finding that Kang Yi believed the Boxers to be possessed of supernatural
                            powers, he did not dare to disagree. All they did was to issue a few
                            hundred proclamations by way of fulfilling their mission, whereupon they
                            reported to the throne that the Boxers had been dispersed. But if that
                            was so, how is it that the Boxer brigands are now so numberless that
                            they can not be exterminated? Why does the throne not hold these
                            ministers responsible for the reckless falsehood of this memorial?</p>
                        <p>At the present moment Tientsin has fallen; and the foreign troops are
                            gaining one position after another. So far the Boxers have not succeeded
                            in preventing their advance by magic arts, and there is every reason to
                            fear that within a fortnight they will be actually striking at the
                            capital. If by any chance the Imperial temples should be alarmed by the
                            shock or the people reduced to misery, what a terrible prospect. At the
                            very thought of it the hearts of your memorialists are filled with
                            distress; but Hsü T’ung, Kang Yi, and the others talk and laugh on the
                            sinking ship, and possess their souls in peace as if they still relied
                            on the ability of the Boxers to form a wall of defense. The whole court
                            has been in a state of bewilderment, like drunken men or fools. Members
                            of the Imperial clan—the Emperor’s kinsmen and scions of noble families;
                            men of high position—Imperial guardians and preceptors and privy
                            councilors, almost all have worshiped the Boxers as supernatural beings.
                            Even in the palaces of princes and dukes Boxer altars are said to have
                            been erected.</p>
                        <p>The folly of the Boxers infected Hsü T’ung and Kang Yi with folly, and
                            the folly of Hsü T’ung and Kang Yi spread to the princes and dukes. Thus
                            Hsü T’ung and Kang Yi are the pivots on which the whole of the present
                            extremity turns. If the Empress Dowager and the Emperor do not put the
                            laws of the realm in force and publicly denounce and punish the high
                            officials who were the ringleaders in encouraging the Boxers, it is to
                            be feared that the whole of the court will be led astray on account of
                            the Boxers, and all the high provincial officials who think to conform
                            to the views of the court—not Yü Hsien and Yu Lu alone—will be befooled
                            along with the court.</p>
                        <p>Alas! The ancestral altars which have blessed our land for three hundred
                            years are to be staked on a single throw by mistaken statesmen in
                            reckless belief in the Boxer cult. How shall the Emperor answer for it
                            to the spirits of his sainted ancestors?</p>
                        <p>Your memorialists submit that the crisis is at hand; not a moment is to
                            be lost. If the Boxers are not immediately exterminated, there is no
                            excuse whereby to stop <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0088"/>the
                            foreign troops. And if the leaders who screen the Boxers are not put to
                            death, it will not be possible to exterminate the Boxers.</p>
                        <p>At the time when the Boxers began their operations they did not dare to
                            disobey the commands of the throne to insult officials, to destroy
                            Government property, to carry arms, and bring fire and slaughter on
                            peaceful citizens. But when Hsü T’ung, Kang Yi, and the others called
                            them patriotic subjects the prestige of the Boxers increased, the common
                            people were led still further astray, and the assemblies of worthless
                            vagabonds became more numerous.</p>
                        <p>If Yü Hsien last year had immediately suppressed these brigands, they
                            would never have been able to spread into Chihli. If Yu Lu this spring
                            had done his duty in checking them, the Boxers would never have been
                            able to invade the capital. If Hsü T’ung, Kang Yi, and the others had
                            not encouraged them with the title of patriotic subjects, these brigands
                            would never have dared to commit such wanton excesses in the way of
                            arson, pillage, and murder. Thus, if the calamity is traced to its
                            source, it becomes clear upon whose shoulders the responsibility must
                            fall.</p>
                        <p>It is the duty therefore of memorialists to ask for a decree in the first
                            place sentencing to severe punishment Hsü T’ung, Kang Yi, Chi Hsiu, Chao
                            Shu-ch’iao, Yu Lu, Yü Hsien, and Tung Fu-hsiang. The other high
                            officials guilty of screening the Boxers, who held equally mistaken
                            views with those of Hsü T’ung and Kang Yi, should all be punished as
                            their guilt deserves, and the customary slight remission in deference to
                            considerations of rank or of relationship should not be granted.</p>
                        <p>If this is done the Boxers, learning thus that the former latitude given
                            to the Boxers in open hostilities was due to the error of these high
                            officials and was not the policy of the Government, may, it is hoped,
                            lay aside the quarrel and resume friendly relations, and the ancestral
                            altars may escape disaster.</p>
                        <p>After this your memorialists beg that they may themselves be put to
                            death, in order to appease the spirits of Hsü T’ung, Kang Yi, and the
                            other high officers. So your memorialists will go joyfully to their
                            doom.</p>
                        <p>This memorial is written with reluctance and many tears under the stress
                            of an indignation and consternation which can not be contained. It is
                            hereby humbly submitted for the perusal of Their Majesties the Empress
                            Dowager and the Emperor.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that some time ago
                        the question of a defensible legation was submitted by the diplomatic corps
                        for advice and report to a commission of military officers composed of one
                        from each of the military forces here.</p>
                    <p>A very full and comprehensive report has been made by the committee, copy of
                        which I inclose. The diplomatic corps has as yet taken no action
                        thereon.</p>
                    <p>While I think the entire area is larger than necessary or advisable, yet I do
                        not deem it best to quarrel with my colleagues upon that score. But I shall,
                        unless otherwise instructed, oppose adopting or beginning work on any system
                        of defense at present. You will observe that the plan as prepared
                        practically provides for a veritable fortress right in the midst of this
                        great city, and directly adjoining the Palace walls. The plan, if carried
                        out, will destroy a large area of private Chinese property, which ought to
                        be paid for by someone, and the Chinese Government will never compensate the
                        individuals for it. Many unnecessary and continuing expenses will be
                        incurred, which somebody will have to meet.</p>
                    <p>In my judgment, all that is necessary now is to have in view, in locating and
                        enlarging the legations, the possible necessity of repelling attacks and so
                        locate them as to make defense as easy as possible, in case the necessity
                        should ever arise.</p>
                    <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0089"/>
                    <p>The legations in Peking are not the only foreign interests in China which may
                        be attacked. There are or will be foreign merchants, traders, engineers, and
                        missionaries at many interior points, and these also deserve protection. It
                        will be impossible to provide defense or even guards for every community of
                        foreigners. Simply defending the legations will not make it safer for the
                        foreigners who are building railroads in the interior or otherwise
                        developing China. In case of troubles these interests will be the first
                        attacked, and, profiting by past experience, the ministers will either have
                        time to get away or provide for the requisite defense.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me the surest and most reasonable way to protect all foreigners
                        is to require the most stringent treaty guaranties for the future and insist
                        upon their being carried out rigidly everywhere. If the Empire is to be
                        preserved with a government at all worth having diplomatic relations with,
                        then it must be a government strong enough to protect the representatives of
                        friendly powers in its capital from mob violence. If it can not do this, or
                        if it is necessary for the foreign powers to defend their representatives
                        against attacks of the Chinese Government itself, then it is not worth
                        holding relations with.</p>
                    <p>Besides, if it shall ever be necessary to fortify it need not be done now. A
                        long time must elapse before all the foreign troops are withdrawn from this
                        province. In the meantime it is to be hoped that the Chinese Government will
                        have returned here and exhibited such ability to preserve order as will make
                        defense unnecessary; but even then there will be time enough to begin the
                        work contemplated in the commission’s report.</p>
                    <p>I inclose a rough map, showing the proposed location of each legation. After
                        several consultations with General Chaffee I have concluded that the part
                        marked U. S. A. will not be large enough for both the legation and guards.
                        Therefore if Colonel Denby’s property is purchased I would advise occupying
                        the whole plot U. S. A. with the legation, and locating the guards on plot
                        marked U. S. B. But if the Colonel Denby property is not purchased, then I
                        recommend locating the legation on plot U. S. B. and placing the buildings
                        and barracks for the guards on plot marked U. S. C. In this case we may be
                        able to induce the Holland legation to move east next to the Russo-Chinese
                        Bank, and so have our legation and guards together. But it is neither
                        inconvenient nor undesirable to have them a little way apart.</p>
                    <p>I am reserving all this property until I can receive the Department’s
                        instructions. If the plot U. S. C. is taken for our guards it will
                        necessitate changing the line of defense proposed by the military commanders
                        so as to include this plot, but that can be done without danger, and the
                        ministers will doubtless agree to it.</p>
                    <p>The Germans have already begun work upon the barracks for their guards on the
                        plot of ground marked “German guards,” which is a very considerable distance
                        from their legation.</p>
                    <p>As soon as this matter is taken up by the foreign representatives I will
                        report further.</p>
                    <p>I have the honor, etc.,</p>

                        <head><hi rend="italic">Report of the military commission on the defense of
                                the proposed legation quarter at Peking.</hi></head>
                        <p>The accompanying plan shows the areas which the ministers of the powers
                            represented in Peking propose to occupy for their respective legations;
                            and the general line of defense to inclose this area is marked A. D. H.
                            K. A. The ground marked W. X. Y. Z. is claimed by both France and Japan.
                            The precise boundary requires to be determined by the ministers.</p>
                        <p>2. The southern boundary is the Tartar City wall, the occupation of which
                            is considered by the military commission to be essential to any scheme
                            of defense, and the portion of the wall occupied must project beyond the
                            east and west fronts to admit of the necessary flanking fire. These
                            projections are marked on the plan, and should contain emplacements to
                            mount guns for flanking purposes and for sweeping the wall beyond the
                            limits occupied.</p>
                        <p>3. The line N. O. was proposed for the west British limit and L. M. for
                            that of the United States but the Russian minister is unwilling to
                            withdraw his front to M. W., consequently it becomes necessary to
                            advance the whole west front of the line to A. D., and the open space
                            necessary for defense will have to be provided by demolitions to the
                            west of Gaselee road.</p>
                        <p>4. The German east front J. K. is now occupied by a Russian subject, and
                            it is the unanimous opinion of the commission that it is necessary for
                            defensive purposes, and to afford free communication to the front that
                            this property shall be acquired by Germany, either by sale or
                            exchange.</p>
                        <p>5. It is understood that the Chinese Government can not be expected to
                            agree to the occupation by the allies of the Chien Men, or main central
                            gate leading to the Imperial Palace, but if this gate is not occupied
                            the ruined buildings over the outer and inner entrances which completely
                            command the wall, should, from a military point of view, be razed to the
                            general level of the wall, and reconstruction should not be permitted.
                            The buildings are now practically destroyed by fire. The ramps which
                            afford access to the gate should be removed.</p>
                        <p>6. It is considered desirable that the Hata Men should be included in the
                            defenses, but the Russian representative is of the opinion that this is
                            unnecessary. If not included the buildings over the gates should be
                            leveled, as in the last paragraph, and a new gate constructed in the
                            Tartar City wall near the center of the south face of the legation
                            quarter; this gate should be preferably the water gate of the canal in
                            the German quarter. The height of the opening would require to be raised
                            so as to admit of a roadway over the canal without interfering with the
                            drainage. The opening should be arched so as not to interfere with free
                            communication along the top of the wall. The eastern ramp leading to the
                            wall above the Hata Men should be dismantled, but if the gate is not
                            occupied both ramps should be removed.</p>
                        <p>7. Cross trenches through the top of the Tartar City wall, 5 to 7 meters
                            wide, and about 3 meters deep, should be made outside each end of the
                            portion occupied in the wall. These trenches should be aligned and
                            graded so that they can be swept by fire from other points in the
                            defenses, P. Q., R. S.</p>
                        <p>8. It is essential that there should be a clear zone or glacis round the
                            defenses on the west, north, and east sides, and the commission
                            considers that the minimum width of this space should be 150 yards
                            (about 140 meters), but where possible it is desirable that this width
                            should be increased. The Russian representative considers that it would
                            be best on the west side to clear the whole space up to the wall of the
                            Imperial City, and this was unanimously agreed to. It was also agreed
                            that the Ketteler-strasse should form the limit on the east side. No
                            building to be allowed against the outer side of the Tartar City wall or
                            on the open space to the south of the wall.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese houses outside and near the Hata Men should be demolished,
                            and there should be a distance of 100 meters clear of buildings to the
                            west of the western limit occupied on the wall.</p>
                        <p>It should be very clearly laid down that all buildings on these glacis or
                            open spaces are to be removed, and no new buildings should on any
                            account be permitted; nor should materials, except for military
                            purposes, be stacked or placed on these glacis.</p>
                        <p>9. The whole area which it is recommended should be obtained from the
                            Chinese Government is marked <hi rend="italic">a, b, c, d, e, f, g,
                                h</hi>, and the boundary should be indicated on the ground by
                            masonry pillars.</p>
                        <p>The question of preventing access to the glacis or defenses having been
                            raised, it was considered by the majority that iron railings were
                            expensive and undesirable, and that the most suitable kind of a fence
                            was one of barbed wire, which could be erected by each legation where
                            considered necessary, the concurrence of the adjacent legations being
                            obtained.</p>
                        <p>10. The commission considers that the outer south wall of the Imperial
                            palace, <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0091"/>immediately north of
                            Stewart road, must be demolished to give a sufficient open space at the
                            northwest corner of the defenses.</p>
                        <p>Lieutenant-Colonel Shiba (Japan) suggested that as the Imperial City wall
                            was used during the recent siege of the legations as an artillery
                            position, it might be stipulated as a punitive measure that this wall
                            should be reduced to one-half its present height. This would doubtless
                            be a military advantage, and would admit of a reduction in the height of
                            the legation defenses facing the wall.</p>
                        <p>11. It is accepted that the defenses can not take the form of a modern
                            fortress, and should consist of defensible walls, protected or
                            strengthened with earthwork, gun emplacements being provided at
                            intervals. In addition to the flank defense from the Tartar City wall,
                            each legation will have to arrange for the flank defense of its own area
                            in consultation with the adjacent legations, and machine or quick-firing
                            guns will be required for flanking fire.</p>
                        <p>12. The minimum height of the walls forming the defensive line should be
                            about 3½ meters, earth protection in front of the walls being considered
                            advantageous. It is desirable that the ditch should have a minimum width
                            of 5 meters and a depth of not less than 2 meters, provided that this
                            admits of proper drainage so that water may not stagnate in the ditch.
                            If the necessity of providing for drainage does not permit of excavation
                            to a depth of 2 meters the height of the wall can be increased and a
                            glacis made so that the necessary depth may be obtained artifically. An
                            obstacle in the bottom of the ditch is desirable. Raised roads outside
                            the defenses should either be cut down or the outer sides be sloped off
                            in the form of a glacis.</p>
                        <p>13. A covered way with earthern parapet carried on arches should be
                            constructed across the canal near T to connect the British and Japanese
                            legations. Further details of construction to be left to the nations
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>14. It is proposed that the front between the canal and F should be
                            constructed and defended by Japan, whose soldiers played so important a
                            part during the recent attack on the legations, and who would otherwise
                            hold no portion of the front line. This front forms the northern
                            boundary of the proposed international public garden, and it is further
                            proposed that Japan should build and hold the left flank defenses of
                            this garden facing the canal. For this arrangement to be efficient Japan
                            must be afforded communication from the rear to all parts of these
                            fronts.</p>
                        <p>15. The Japanese troops would, as far as possible, form a general reserve
                            for the eastern part of the legation quarter. When necessary, and if
                            possible, Russia would assist in the general defense of the western
                            portion.</p>
                        <p>16. The legation guards tentatively proposed by the military
                            representatives of the powers for each national quarter are as follows:

                        <p>17. The Spanish, Belgian, and Dutch legations have at present no military
                            guards, but it would appear fair, from a military point of view, that
                            these countries should provide suitable guards. In the case of Holland,
                            the commission is of opinion that unless a suitable guard is provided by
                            that country the outer line of defense on the west front should be taken
                            by the United States, in which case it would seem desirable that the
                            Dutch legation should be located elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>18. The terminal station of the Paotingfu line is to be built outside the
                            Tartar City wall, west of the Chien Men, and it is considered desirable
                            that the space outside the wall between the Chien Men and Hata Men
                            should be reserved for the terminus of the Peking-Tientsin line, on
                            which railway communication with the coast depends. This would bring the
                            station yard under the immediate defense of the legation quarter, <pb
                                n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0092"/>and would also, by the
                            construction of a short connecting line, allow for the rolling stock of
                            the Southern Bail way being run into this station for protection, if
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>As railway communication is a matter of great military importance, it
                            appears necessary that a stipulation should be made with the Chinese
                            Government that the terminal points of the railway lines are always to
                            remain within the Chinese City.</p>
                        <p>19. Aerial telephonic communication should be established between the
                            various legations, and underground telephonic lines are also
                            desirable.</p>
                        <p>20. Not less than three months’ supplies should be maintained for the
                            troops in Peking. There should also be a sufficient reserve of arms and
                            ammunition.</p>
                        <p>21. It was proposed that the detailed arrangements for disposition of the
                            troops defending the legation area should be drawn up by a commission of
                            the officers in command of the legation guards under the senior officer
                            as president, and that the senior military officer on duty in Peking
                            should be in command of the whole during an attack. The Russian
                            representative, however, stated that he will arrange for the defense of
                            his own legation, and will work amicably with the other officers, but
                            will not take orders from the senior officer of another nation; nor will
                            he, if the senior, accept the command of the whole. The representative
                            of the United States considers that this matter of command must be left
                            for subsequent consideration.</p>
                        <p>The Russian representative considered that there should be a council of
                            war composed of the senior officer from each of the eight legations
                            providing the military guards. This proposal was generally concurred in.
                            The French representative considers that it should be defined that the
                            decision on general defense questions should rest entirely with the
                            president, who will be the officer in chief command in time of war.</p>
                        <p>It was suggested that each nation in turn should appoint a senior
                            officer, of not lower rank than lieutenant-colonel, for a certain
                            period, as commandant in time of war. The period might be from one to
                            three years, and this suggestion is offered for consideration by the
                            ministers.</p>
                        <p>22. It is necessary to begin the defenses as soon as possible, so as to
                            get the work well advanced before the return of the Chinese Government,
                            and completed before the rainy season.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that on the 16th
                        the question of indemnities was taken up by the foreign ministers and
                        discussed generally, <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0093"/>developing the
                        fact, which from private conversations was already evident, that there are
                        nearly as many different opinions as there are ministers.</p>
                    <p>I suggested the adoption of a lump sum which should be within the ability of
                        China to pay, and as this would evidently be not sufficient to pay the
                        demands in full, each power would have to agree to a scaling down
                        proportionate to their claims.</p>
                    <p>This does not meet with the approval of my colleagues. All say they have no
                        instructions as to this method, and none of them, except the Japanese, seem
                        really to favor it. * * * The German minister insists that China is able to
                        pay the entire amount of all demands, and that his Government will require
                        full compensation for all their expenditures and losses.</p>
                    <p>It is understood by all that the war indemnities or expenses must be fixed by
                        the Governments themselves, but the information sought in the telegram
                        confirmed herewith was deemed important by all of my colleagues. Some of
                        them believe that special indemnities-should be demanded for the legation
                        guards who were killed or wounded during the siege, on the ground that they
                        were here by consent of the Chinese Government. But if this rule should be
                        applied, then it should also be extended to those killed and wounded in the
                        column of Seymour and McCalla; and from these it is but a very short and
                        hardly distinguishable step to all soldiers, sailors, and marines who were
                        anywhere engaged in the expedition. It seems to me, therefore, that all
                        soldiers, sailors, and marines should be treated alike.</p>
                    <p>You will note in the private claims sent you that all sorts of impossible
                        demands are made. Without definite instructions I understand that the
                        general practice of the United States in the matter of the presentation of
                        private claims is that— <list>

                            <item>That remote, consequential, or speculative damages or anticipated
                                profits are not chargeable;</item>
                            <label>(3)</label>
                            <item>That interest oh claims is not allowable.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>I also observe, in view of the plain agreement in our treaty, that China will
                        defend our citizens from “all insult or injury of any sort;” that our
                        Government has at times gone further in demanding indirect damages from the
                        Chinese than it probably would have done without this treaty provision.</p>
                    <p>The question whether each legation should undertake to examine the claims of
                        its own nationals, instead of having recourse to a mixed commission for the
                        investigation of international claims, has been somewhat discussed, and it
                        is the general opinion of the ministers that each legation or Government
                        should investigate and pass upon the claims of its own people.</p>
                    <p>If this plan is adopted it will be necessary that some general principles
                        upon which all private claims shall be based should be agreed to and
                        followed by all the Governments. This question will be soon taken up for
                        discussion.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 16th the foreign representatives
                        received from the Chinese plenipotentiaries a note inclosing three Imperial
                        decrees fixing additional punishments for the persons whom we had
                        designated.</p>
                    <p>It was, however, very unsatisfactory. It did not in any way mention the
                        demand we had made, and the decrees were apparently issued of the court’s
                        own motion, although from some things in them we knew our note had been
                        previously received. They did not record death sentences against Prince Tuan
                        and Duke Lan, as we required and as had been intimated to us by the
                        plenipotentiaries could be done. They decreed only imprisonment for Chao
                        Shu-chiao and Ying Nien, instead of death, and for Chi Hsiu and Hsü Cheng-yu
                        they said severe punishment should be meted out after sufficient proof of
                        guilt could, on investigation by Prince Ching and Li Hung-chang, be produced
                        against them. The decree conferring posthumous honors upon the decapitated
                        members of the Tsungli Yamen was most unsatisfactory. It charged them with
                        crimes, and simply restored the rank of which they had been deprived by
                        their punishment.</p>
                    <p>These are the usual Chinese methods, which we were unanimous in agreeing
                        ought to be strenuously resisted. Believing that the court can and will
                        execute the punishments demanded, we have repeated our demands in a note, a
                        copy of which I inclose. * * *</p>

                        <p>On the 13th of February, 1901, the following Imperial decree was issued
                            to the Grand Secretariat:</p>
                        <p>Since the 5th moon the Boxer rebels have headed disturbances which have
                            resulted in a breach of our relations with friendly states. Prince Ching
                            and Li Hung-chang had now, in consultation with the Representatives of
                            the powers at Peking, negotiated and signed a draft treaty embodying the
                            principles on which peace shall be restored.</p>
                        <p>In reflecting on the causes which lie at the root of this calamity we
                            find that they are to be traced in reality to the attitude of the
                            princes and high ministers of state, who, in their crass ignorance and
                            reckless and violent disregard for law arid order, placed implicit trust
                            in magic arts, brought pressure to bear on the court, and willfully
                            disobeyed the decrees ordering the suppression of the Boxer rebels. Not
                            only that, but they went out of their way to aid and lend their support
                            to these scoundrels in their lawless acts of aggression and combat. As a
                            consequence, a hellish conflagration broke out, and ten thousands of
                            evil-doers banding themselves together in our immediate neighborhood,
                            created a situation with which it was impossible to deal.</p>
                        <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0095"/>
                        <p>They further incited ignorant general officers and untrained troops to
                            surround and attack the legations for a period of several months, with
                            the result that a calamity of an unprecedented nature overtook the
                            state, that the whole constitution of the nation was placed in dire
                            peril, that our ancestral tombs and temples were disturbed, that the
                            whole country was ravaged and plundered, and that our people grievously
                            perished.</p>
                        <p>The circumstances of danger and distress, in which we and the Empress
                            Dowager found ourselves, can hardly be spoken of. Our heart even now is
                            sore and our head aches. Grief and resentment in equal measure fill our
                            breast. And all this because the princes and ministers of state, by
                            trusting to magic and meddling evil-doers, imperiled the shrines of our
                            ancestors and plunged our people into misery. If they put the question
                            (to themselves) what punishment is their due, how shall they reply?</p>
                        <p>We have already issued two edicts on the subject of their punishment, but
                            we still feel that the penalties are light compared with the gravity of
                            their crimes, and that the former do not suffice to atone for the
                            latter. We therefore have again to mete out to them yet severer
                            judgments in proportion (to their varying degrees of guilt).</p>
                        <p>Tsai Hsün, prince of Chuang, who has already been deprived of his rank,
                            aided and encouraged the Boxer rebels to attack the legations. He, on
                            his own responsibility, issued a proclamation, contrary to treaty, and
                            lightly giving ear to the counsels of evil-doers, unjustly compassed the
                            death of many. Of a truth is he clownishly fierce and grossly stupid.
                            Let him be awarded the privilege of committing suicide. The president of
                            the censorate, Ko Pao-hua, will proceed to his residence and see that
                            this sentence is carried out.</p>
                        <p>Tsai I, prince of Tuan, who has already been deprived of his rank, was
                            the leader of the princes and Imperial dukes who lightly put their trust
                            in the Boxers, and with his wild statements was the principal director
                            of the fighting which caused the trouble. It is of a truth with
                            difficulty that he can exculpate himself.</p>
                        <p>Tsai Lan, an Imperial duke of the first order, degraded and transferred
                            to another post, collaborated with Tsai Hsün in unauthorizedly issuing
                            the proclamation contrary to treaty. He must also be punished. Let him
                            be deprived of his rank and offices. In consideration of the fact,
                            however, that they are our near relatives we will extend to them special
                            favor. They are hereby sentenced to life imprisonment in the new
                            dominion. An officer is to be deputed to keep them under surveillance in
                            the first instance.</p>
                        <p>Yü Hsien, the governor who has already been deprived of his rank, when
                            holding office as governor of Shantung, recklessly believed in the
                            magical arts of the Boxers, and on coming to Peking extolled their
                            virtues to such an extent that the princes and high ministers of state
                            were carried away (by his misstatements). When governor of Shansi he
                            ordered killed many missionaries and native Christians. More than the
                            others is he marked out by his crass stupidity and fierce cruelty—a
                            criminal of the deepest dye and one of the chief ringleaders. He has
                            already been banished to the new dominion and ought by now to have
                            arrived in Kansu. Let him immediately be decapitated. A copy of this
                            sentence is at once to be transmitted (to those concerned) and the
                            Provincial Judge Ho Tu-kun is deputed to see it carried out.</p>
                        <p>Kang Yi, an assistant grand secretary and president of the board of
                            revenue, aided and abetted, the Boxers, brought about the present
                            disasters, and joined in the issue of the proclamation aforesaid. A
                            heavy penalty ought to be inflicted on him, but he has already died a
                            natural death; he is hereby posthumously deprived of his office and is
                            to be forthwith stripped of his rank.</p>
                        <p>Tung Fu-hsiang, who has been deprived of his rank, while retained at his
                            post as commander in chief of the province of Kansu, brought his troops
                            to act as bodyguard to the Emperor, but did not maintain adequate
                            control over them. He was further ignorant of international affairs and
                            acted in an incoherent, reckless, and foolish manner. Although he
                            surrounded and attacked the legations at the instigation of the princes
                            and others, already degraded, he can not rid himself of culpability.
                            Properly speaking, he ought to be severely punished, but in extenuation
                            be it said that he has rendered most meritorious service in the province
                            of Kansu and the Chinese and Mahometans render him cheerful obedience.
                            As an act of extraordinary grace we only deprive him of his rank, such
                            deprivation to take place immediately.</p>
                        <p>Ying Men, president of the censorate, who has been lowered in rank and
                            transferred to another post, attempted to dissuade Tsai Hsün from
                            recklessly issuing the proclamation contrary to treaty, which is a point
                            in his favor. But as he was not able to make his opposition effectual,
                            he can hardly rid himself of responsibility. As an act of grace he is
                            deprived of his rank and sentenced to imprisonment pending
                            decapitation.</p>
                        <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0096"/>
                        <p>Chao Shu-chiao, president of the board of punishments, who has been
                            deprived of his rank while retained at his post, was not ordinarily
                            noted, for any antiforeign proclivities, and when sent to investigate
                            Boxer affairs did not put forward statements screening them. He is,
                            however, guilty of culpable negligence. As an act of grace he is hereby
                            deprived of his rank and sentenced to imprisonment pending
                            decapitation.</p>
                        <p>Both Ying Men and Chao Shu-chiao are in the first instance to be
                            incarcerated in the gaol of the provincial capital of Shensi
                            (Hsian).</p>
                        <p>The grand secretary, Hsü Tung, and the former governor-general of
                            Ssu-chuan, Li Ping-heng, who was degraded and transferred, have already
                            died for their country, but as their conduct has given rise to adverse
                            criticism, they are both hereby deprived of their rank, and their
                            posthumous honors conferred on them are canceled.</p>
                        <p>When this edict shall have appeased all states who are friendly to us
                            ought to realize that the Boxer troubles really were the outcome of
                            pressure brought to bear by the ringleaders, and that their actions were
                            in no way whatever inspired by the court. In punishing the ringleaders
                            we have not erred on the side of lenient protection, and all our
                            subjects throughout the land—officials and others—will clearly
                            understand that the issues involved in this matter are of the
                            gravest.</p>
                        <p>Transmitted by the grand council to the 18 provinces.</p>

                        <p>The troubles which took place in the course of the fifth moon, and of
                            which the Boxer rebels were the chief leaders, increased in violence
                            from day to day. The court, being at a loss to know how to repress or to
                            appease, on several occasions summoned the ministers to audience, in
                            hopes that after they had weighed the circumstances of the case they
                            would afford us an indication of the proper steps to take. We repeatedly
                            addressed inquiries to Hsü Yung-i, President of the Board of War, Li
                            Shan, President of the Board of Revenue, Hsu Ching-cheng, vice-President
                            of the Board of Civil Office, Lien Yuan, Subchancellor of the Grand
                            Secretariat, and Yuan Chang, a Director of the court of Sacrificial
                            Worship, but the drift of their answers (was noncommittal), advocating
                            two courses as equally practicable. The various ministers who
                            constituted the ringleaders (of the Boxer faction) profited by this
                            opportunity to bring false denunciations against them, with the result
                            that they incurred the penalty of death.</p>
                        <p>When we consider, however, the long service of Hsü Yung-i and the others,
                            and their capacity for dealing in a friendly spirit with international
                            affairs, which they ordinarily displayed, their efforts may be described
                            as meritorious, and as an act of grace we hereby restore Hsü Yung-i, Li
                            Shan, Hsü Ching-cheng, Lien Yuan, and Yuan-chang to their original
                            offices.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to confirm my telegram of the
                        18th instant and your reply thereto of the 19th, concerning the order of
                        Count von Waldersee referring to the possibility of a resumption of military
                        operations on a large scale because of the present conditions of peace
                        negotiations, and to inclose a copy of the order as transmitted to me for
                        information by General Chaffee.</p>
                    <p>There is little doubt that the order was intended as a bluff to frighten the
                        Chinese into an immediate compliance with our demands, as it was given out
                        that the operations contemplated a movement in force to Sian Fu, which is
                        practically impossible and was never intended to be executed. But there has
                        been a constant disposition upon the part of most of the military commanders
                        to do something or go somewhere with their troops upon the flimsiest of
                        excuses, so that during the winter a great part of this province has been
                        gone over.</p>
                    <p>The probability was that under this order some kind of a movement would be
                        made which might seriously disturb our present efforts at negotiation,
                        frighten the court, make its return to Peking less probable, and jeopardize
                        the final settlement. Having all joined in the peace negotiations, no single
                        power has any right to pursue independent offensive operations. Such a
                        course would disturb harmonious action and might at any time break the
                        concert; therefore I have insisted with my colleagues upon the principle set
                        forth in the following statement which I made to my colleagues in the
                        meeting of the 18th instant: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>It is currently reported that some of the military commanders are
                                discussing the possibility of, and making preparations for, an early
                                active resumption of military operations on a large scale, because
                                of the present course of peace negotiations.</p>
                            <p>I do not desire in any way to criticise the military; but in view of
                                the fact that all the governments have jointly entered into
                                negotiations for a peaceful settlement, it is hardly competent for
                                any of the powers to disturb the harmony, endanger the concert, or
                                jeopardize the result of negotiations by resuming military
                                operations without the consent of all.</p>
                            <p>I signed the joint note in which our demands were formulated under
                                the express stipulation that it in no way committed my Government to
                                further military operations. And the note was finally agreed to
                                after the declared understanding that the last clause, which was
                                added by our British colleagues, limited military operations to the
                                occupancy of Peking and this province.</p>
                            <p>If this report as to proposed military movements proves true, and my
                                colleagues are of the same opinion, I suggest that the ministers
                                recommend to their respective military commanders or to their
                                governments the postponement of any contemplated military operations
                                until the arrival at such a stage in the peace negotiations as the
                                governments agree will warrant their resumption.</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>I made this not so much as a protest against this particular proposed
                        movement as against the assumed right of any independent action which might
                        endanger the success of negotiations, and which several of the powers seem
                        determined to exercise.</p>

                        <p>Although the peace negotiations are still continued, their present course
                            gives me cause to allude to the possibility of being obliged to resume
                            very soon active military operations on a large scale. As a favorable
                            season is approaching, I request that as soon as possible those
                            arrangements and preparations be made which are necessary to assume the
                            readiness of all forces toward the end of this month. First of all, it
                            will be necessary to provide sufficient transportation means to enable
                            the troops to take along a supply of ammunition and provisions for about
                            eight days over difficult mountain roads.</p>
                        <p>Although the greatest part of provisions will probably be taken from the
                            districts where the operations are going on, the conditions are not
                            sufficiently known to rely upon this. It will, therefore, be necessary
                            for the forwarding of the most necessary provisions to form and equip
                            transport columns which are able to overcome considerable difficulties
                            of the terrane.</p>

                        take place on the 24th, and the two here on the 26th.</p>
                    <p>Those at Sian Fu were to be verified by an Italian priest residing there,
                        those in the city by the Japanese legation, and the others by an Imperial

                        by certain named officials.</p>
                    <p>It was thought by all the ministers that some of the most prominent

                        many cases, torture of the missionaries, ought to be severely punished at

                                by Chinese plenipotentiaries from Grand Council February 22, 1901,
                                and transmitted to Doyen on February 23, 1901.</hi></head>
                        <p>In a late decree, dealing with those chiefly responsible for the recent
                            misfortune, we meted out to them varying degrees of severe
                            punishment.</p>
                        <p>I-K’uang (Prince Ching) and Li Hung-chang now report to us by telegraph
                            that the note presented by the foreign plenipotentiaries calls for yet
                            heavier penalties, and they pray that We take the matter into further
                            consideration.</p>
                        <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0099"/>
                        <p>Leaving out of account Tsai Hsün (Prince Chuang), who has already been
                            granted the privilege of committing suicide, and Yü Hsien, orders for
                            whose immediate decapitation had been issued—officers in each case being
                            deputed personally to supervise the carrying out of the sentence—We
                            hereby decree as follows:</p>
                        <p>Tsai I (Prince Tuan) and Tsai Lan are to be imprisoned pending
                            decapitation. Bearing in mind, however, the fact that they are our near
                            relatives and having regard to the ties of kinship, We, as a special act
                            of grace, commute this sentence to one of perpetual incarceration on the
                            most remote frontier of the new dominion. Officers will forthwith be
                            appointed to take them into custody and set out with them on the journey
                            to their place of exile.</p>
                        <p>Kang Yi’s guilt is characterized by features of exceptional gravity. His
                            sentence ought to be that of immediate decapitation, but as he has
                            already died a natural death, no further action need be taken.</p>
                        <p>Our previous decree sentenced Ying Nien and Chao Shu-chiao to
                            imprisonment pending decapitation. They are now granted the privilege of
                            committing suicide. T’sen Chun-hsuan, governor of Shensi, will himself
                            supervise the execution of this sentence.</p>
                        <p>Ch’i Hsiu and Hsü C’heng-yu were recently deprived of their rank. The
                            foreign powers having pointed out that they materially abetted the Boxer
                            rebels and were noted for their antiforeign attitude, I K’uang and Li
                            Hung-chang are hereby directed to apply to the powers for their
                            rendition, and when this shall have been effected, immediately to
                            decapitate them. The heads of the boards of punishments will see that
                            these sentences are carried into execution.</p>
                        <p>Hsü Tung, by lightly placing confidence in the Boxer rebels, seriously
                            compromised the situation. Li Ping-heng, by his magniloquent language
                            and bigoted obstinance, was instrumental in bringing about trouble. Both
                            ought to have been sentenced to imprisonment pending decapitation, but
                            as on the eve of adversity they committed suicide and have already been
                            deprived of their rank and posthumous distinctions, no further action
                            need be taken.</p>
                        <p>The crimes of which the chief delinquents were guilty have been clearly
                            set forth in detail in Our former decree.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that in
                        pursuance of your telegraphic instructions of the 23d instant to Mr. Conger
                        and myself, the diplomatic representatives and the Chinese peace
                        commissioners were duly informed that I would take charge of the United
                        States’ interests in the pending negotiations. On the 24th I entered upon my
                        duties.</p>
                    <p>To-day the diplomatic representatives in conference decided upon the
                        boundaries of the area which they deem necessary for the diplomatic
                        quarter—the Chinese Government having agreed, in principle, to concede one
                        to the treaty powers for that purpose. They based their demands on the
                        report of the mixed military commission, copy of which was sent you in Mr.
                        Conger’s No. 536, of the 16th instant, with a plan of the proposed quarter.
                        A note will be at once addressed to the Chinese plenipotentiaries stating
                        the demands of the powers in the matter. Some slight modifications may be
                        made in the western portion of the area, if the Chinese too strenuously
                        refuse all that is demanded in that direction.</p>
                    <p>While agreeing with my colleagues in the demand for this tract of land, I
                        called their attention to the fact that the area in it allotted to the
                        United States was, from every point of view, inadequate to the actual
                        requirements of my Government for the accommodation of a legation with a
                        guard, in case it should, as I hoped, decide to build one. The land, whether
                        private or governmental property, in the legation quarter was seized by the
                        various representatives here immediately <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94"
                            facs="0100"/>after the siege, without any regard to their actual or
                        eventual wants and with the intention of, later on, disposing of it to their
                        nationals as they might see fit. The representative of the United States not
                        having followed this course, we can but extend over the few lots of ground
                        along the face of the wall of the Tartar City, which you can see by
                        reference to the plan.</p>
                    <p>I informed my colleagues that I only agreed to demanding the present
                        diplomatic quarter on the understanding that later on they would agree to
                        consider the proposition of my Government asking for China to make in Peking
                        an international concession and put the city on the footing of a treaty
                        port.</p>
                    <p>The property seized by the German, French, Italian, and Austrian-Hungarian
                        legations included all that occupied until the siege by Sir Robert Hart and
                        the Foreign Maritime Customs staff, at which time it was entirely destroyed.
                        I took advantage of the discussion being brought on this subject by the
                        reading of a letter of Sir Robert to the British minister against the
                        practical confiscation of his property, to express the profound regret which
                        my Government and people would feel on learning that any of the powers
                        should have found it necessary under any circumstances to dispossess or in
                        any way interfere with the Maritime Customs, a cosmopolitan institution in
                        which we all take equal and just pride. Its distinguished head, to whose
                        efforts more than to any other living man is due the present flourishing
                        condition of foreign trade in China and the introduction of many western
                        methods and improvements, deserves, we think, every consideration from the
                        whole western world. The British minister spoke on the same lines, referring
                        to the great services of Sir Robert Hart, not only to commerce, but to
                        diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>The other diplomatic representatives expressed their high appreciation of the
                        Customs service, but I have little hope that any of the seized property will
                        be returned to the customs, though another tract within the diplomatic
                        quarter and on the eastern side is to be offered in lieu thereof.</p>

                        representatives, in their meeting held yesterday, considered the question of
                        punishments to be demanded for provincial officials and other persons most
                        directly responsible for the massacres and riots of last year. The list
                        comprised about one hundred names, against ten of whom it was proposed that
                        capital punishment should be asked, the others to be cashiered and never to

                        24th instant, stating that the President’s earnest wish was that the
                        effusion of blood should cease; that, with the execution of the chief
                        authors of the recent troubles, and in view of the severity of the material
                        punishment inflicted upon China, he would be pleased if the powers would
                        agree not to ask for more death sentences. I added that the President did
                        not propose, however, to decide on the necessity of such demands and that,
                        therefore, I would not put myself in opposition if they agreed to it, but
                        that I would not demand the capital punishment of any person, though I would
                        ask dismissal from the public service against a number. The question will
                        probably be disposed of within a week. I am inclined to think that the
                        number of capital sentences asked for will be less than those now submitted.
                        At the same time as this demand is sent in to the Chinese I will endeavor to
                        have a demand made for posthumous honors for Chang Yin-huan.</p>
                    <p>The conference then proceeded to a consideration of the names of the
                        localities in which examinations are to be prohibited during five years. I
                        submitted a tentative list, which will be added to or revised by each
                        legation and submitted to the Chinese Commission at the same time as the
                        list of punishments.</p>
                    <p>Committees were then appointed from among the representatives to prepare and
                        submit at the earliest possible date memoranda on the prohibition of the
                        importation of arms, etc. (Joint Note, Article V), and on the reform in
                        court ceremonial and reorganization of the Tsung-li Yamen (Article XII). The
                        first-named committee is composed of the Russian and British ministers and
                        myself; the second, of the Japanese minister and myself. I am also on the
                        committee charged with the preparation of rules for assessing claims. On
                        this committee are also the German, Belgian, and Netherlands ministers. It
                        is hoped by this latter committee that it will be able to present a report
                        to the conference within a week. This will serve as a basis for discussion,
                        and will, I hope, be adopted in some shape by all the powers in establishing
                        their claims. The question is, however, a particularly difficult and
                        delicate one, especially in view of our wish to ask for a lump sum from
                        China, to be afterwards distributed among the powers. So far no strong
                        opposition has developed against your proposition for a lump sum, and I hope
                        it may be finally agreed to.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The diplomatic representatives at their
                        conference this morning, after having read a note from the Chinese peace
                        commissioners stating that reports had been received from the various high
                        officials designated to see that the death sentences against Prince Chuang,
                        Ying Men, Chao Shu-chiao, and Yü Hsien had been duly carried out, and that
                        these personages had either committed suicide or been executed between the
                        21st and 24th of February, decided, nevertheless, to ask for an Imperial
                        decree stating these facts.</p>
                    <p>The representatives then took up for consideration the plan of defense of the
                        legation quarter. After a lengthy exchange of views on the subject, and in
                        view of the declarations made by the British minister and myself that we
                        could not discuss the subject until it had been fully examined by our
                        respective Governments, it was agreed to refer the whole matter to our
                        Governments for instructions.</p>
                    <p>The plan of defense is embodied in the report of the mixed military
                        commission which was forwarded to you by Mr. Conger in his No. 536, of the
                        16th of February. I thoroughly concur with the views therein expressed, and
                        shall oppose adopting or beginning work on any system of defense at
                        present.</p>
                    <p>I submitted to-day to my colleagues that the political side of this question,
                        as well as of all the questions connected with military measures to be taken
                        in this province, was infinitely the most important, and they must all agree
                        with me that the carrying out of the elaborate plan provided for by the
                        report was of very doubtful expediency, if we propose to try and establish
                        cordial relations with the Chinese Government. We had, by the terms of the
                        Joint Note, acquired the right to make the diplomatic quarter defensible,
                        and to hold with military forces the lines of communication with the sea,
                        but we should, I thought, confine ourselves to letting the “Chinese know
                        that we will only exercise these rights so far as conditions may require,
                        and that the extent of our defensive measures, both in Peking and along the
                        lines of communication, must always depend on the spirit which may animate
                        the Chinese Government and people.</p>
                    <p>The plan of defense submitted is, furthermore, entirely dependent on an
                        assured permanent garrison in Peking of 2,000 men; but the Russian and
                        British ministers and I stated that our Governments had not agreed to
                        maintain this number permanently and, I added, the United States would not
                        agree to enter into any scheme of permanent occupation; could not, in fact,
                        without legislative action. I said that so far as we were concerned, we
                        reserved absolute liberty of action, not only as to the number of the guard
                        we might keep here, but even to keeping any guard here at all.</p>
                    <p>The concensus of opinion of the conference was that only such works of
                        defense should be undertaken as were unobtrusive; the razing of the
                        superstructures over the Hata men and the Chien men and a number of other
                        measures deemed indispensable by the military committee seemed to most of
                        the representatives very impolitic. I shall do nothing in the matter without
                        your detailed instructions.</p>
                    <p>The conference will take up in its next meeting, some time next week, the
                        study of the question of indemnities. The discussion of the <pb n="97"
                            xml:id="pg_97" facs="0103"/>principles to govern the presentation of
                        claims promises to occupy a number of meetings.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: * * * Immediately after the raising of the
                        siege a number of foreigners at once began taking possession of and trying
                        to purchase much of the burned and abandoned property in what must
                        necessarily be the future legation quarter.</p>
                    <p>This is not a treaty port where foreigners may purchase land at will, but yet
                        it was apparent that if this was not stopped the entire Chinese-owned
                        property would be taken and no opportunity left for the necessary extensions
                        of the legations.</p>
                    <p>In order to prevent this the foreign representatives, on the 6th of November
                        last, passed the following resolution: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The diplomatic body agrees that no purchase of ground from the
                                Chinese since the commencement of the siege, in the quarter occupied
                                by the legations, will be of any value without the consent of the
                                foreign representatives.</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>This at once put a stop to all purchases or seizures by private
                        individuals.</p>
                    <p>Since the 14th of August, 1900, Peking has been under the military occupation
                        of the allies. On November 6 the allied powers, through their
                        representatives, gave the notice embodied in the resolution quoted above.
                        This was a restriction or qualification of private ownership and a
                        limitation of the right of alienation which, during the “military
                        occupation, the dominant powers had a right to exercise, and no transfers
                        within the time designated could be valid as against the United States or
                        other powers represented here. The restriction was authorized by public law
                        and necessary to prevent the acquisition of the property needed by private
                        individuals for speculative or other purposes. It does not imply the
                        forcible acquisition of property for legation purposes by the United States;
                        but is a precautionary measure against the vesting of intermediate
                        rights.</p>
                    <p>It is always the policy of the United States to make just compensation for
                        property taken for public use. The above view seems to be well sustained by
                        fundamental and international law and by court decisions and practice.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>It is not the practice of the United States to confiscate property for its
                        citizens nor for any other purpose, * * * I have contented myself with
                        designating tracts in the vicinity of the legation’s present residence,
                        which will be ample for the purpose of a new legation, including a place for
                        the proposed guards, in case the Government determines to have a legation of
                        its own. It is, however, probable that in the portion of the quarter
                        allotted to the United States legation there will be some few desirable lots
                        beyond the requirements of the legation, which, of course, citizens of the

                            him acquainted with all the titles and references in support of the
                            properties which they possess in the ground included within the

                            of the powers. The case is therefore settled so far as the punishment of

                        translation of a memorandum from the Chinese plenipotentiaries to the
                        foreign representatives setting forth their objections to the area asked for
                        by the latter in their note of the 1st instant to be used as a diplomatic
                        quarter.</p>
                    <p>In my dispatch No. 30, of February 26, I stated that the foreign
                        representatives were prepared to make certain concessions along the western
                        side of the section they asked for. This is the quarter more particularly
                        occupied by the Chinese Government offices. Some compromise will certainly
                        be reached.</p>
                    <p>You will notice by referring to the plan sent in Mr. Conger’s No. 536, that
                        it is the British Government which wants most of the land now occupied by
                        Chinese governmental offices.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the question of the diplomatic quarter, I find to my great
                        regret that the resolution of the diplomatic body of November 6 last was
                        only sent you on the 4th of the present month in Mr. Conger’s No. 558. The
                        very unusual nature of this resolution, the principle of which I have great
                        difficulty in persuading myself to admit, makes me hope that you will give
                        me as soon as may be instructions for my guidance in its application.</p>

                                Ching and Li Hung-chang, conjointly, on the subject of the legation
                                quarter, dated March 2, 1901.</hi></head>
                        <p>On the 1st instant we received a communication from the doyen,
                            accompanied by a plan, stating that the foreign Representatives had
                            decided upon the area to be set apart as legation quarter and defined
                            the four boundaries of the same; that the public offices and buildings
                            therein situated must be transferred elsewhere, and that the question of
                            compensating the Chinese inhabitants thereof, who must also remove
                            themselves and who are to be expiatoriated, is reserved for a subsequent
                            communication.</p>
                        <p>As regards the Chinese residing in this quarter, who have to remove
                            themselves elsewhere, it is, in the interest of justice and equity,
                            imperative that later on regulations for indemnifying them in respect of
                            their removal expenses and the value of their land be drawn up.</p>
                        <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0106"/>
                        <p>In the memorandum of February 5, which we handed to you, we asked for
                            particulars as to where the legation quarter commenced and where it
                            ended. We stated that all offices and buildings situated therein ought
                            to be considered part of the same, and pointed out the necessity of
                            having a joint delimitation of its boundaries.</p>
                        <p>A careful perusal, however, of the plan accompanying the doyen’s
                            communication shows us that the Tang Tzu, important ground where the
                            Emperor is wont to sacrifice, has been included within the limits, which
                            also embrace the following public offices and buildings:</p>
                        <p>The Imperial clan court, the boards of civil office, revenue, rites, war
                            and works, the Mongolian Superintendency, the Hanlin College, the
                            Imperial Supervisorate of instruction, the Court of the Imperial stud
                            and of state Ceremonial, the Imperial Board of astronomy, the Carriage
                            park, the. Residence for the tributary envoys and the college devoted to
                            the students of the Hanlin Bachelors. All the above-named places are
                            essential to the carrying on of public business. Ever since Peking was
                            made the capital the various public offices have been established inside
                            the Cheng Yang Gate (Chien men), on the right and left of the Imperial
                            city. They are in immediate proximity to and form a circle round the
                            same.</p>
                        <p>Not only does the fact of their being adjacent (to the palace) facilitate
                            the dispatch of public business, but it is a question intimately
                            affecting the prestige and the dignity of the State. This arrangement
                            has remained without change throughout the Yuan and Ming dynasties—a
                            period of now more than five hundred years. The magnitude of the
                            building operations, and the number of public servants—high and low—have
                            also to be considered, and were a transfer insisted upon there would be
                            no other site available. Moreover, the Tang Tzu and these various public
                            offices and buildings are comparatively far away from the legations.
                            Regarded from a legation point of view, their exclusion from the
                            legation quarter would have no harmful results, whereas their inclusion
                            therein would defend the capital city of all that goes to constitute a
                            capital. The action proposed involves consequences of no trifling import
                            to the dignity of the state and the hope of the people.</p>
                        <p>Were we lightly and inconsiderately to acquiesce therein, it is to be
                            feared, that their Majesties, the Empress Dowager and the Emperor,
                            would, on their return, visit us with censure of the severest kind. It
                            is of a truth really impossible for us to take so heavy a load upon our
                            shoulders.</p>
                        <p>It is acordingly incumbent upon us to pray you in the terms of our former
                            memorandum, to agree to consider these buildings as not included in the
                            legation quarter.</p>
                        <p>To accede to our request would afford ample evidence that the foreign
                            ministers plenipotentiary are in sympathy with the sincere desire to
                            strengthen friendly relations, which animates our Government.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                        dispatch No 36, of March 7 last, inclosing the translation of a memorandum
                        from the Chinese plenipotentiaries to the foreign representatives setting
                        forth their objections to the area to be used as a diplomatic quarter asked
                        for by the latter in their note of March 1.</p>
                    <p>While the Department considers the resolution of November 6, 1900, which
                        says: “The diplomatic body agrees that no purchase of ground from the
                        Chinese since the commencement of the siege, in the quarter occupied by the
                        legations, will be of any value without the consent of the foreign
                        representatives,” as being of unusual nature, the exceptional character of
                        the resolution is believed to be justified in view of the inconvenience that
                        might result from permitting foreigners to speculate in land intended to be
                        occupied by the foreign legations, taken in conjunction with the fact that
                        Pekin is not a treaty port where foreigners may purchase land at will.</p>
                    <p>The Department has, therefore, approved the action of Mr. Conger <pb n="101"
                            xml:id="pg_101" facs="0107"/>reported in his No. 558, while recognizing
                        the exceptional character of the resolution passed by the representatives of
                        the foreign powers.</p>
                    <p>In reply to your request for instructions for your guidance in the
                        application of the resolution, the Department would enjoin the withholding
                        for the present of authorization of the acquisition of the land in question
                        by private individuals.</p>
                    <p>As regards bona fide purchases made before the action taken by the foreign
                        representatives, it may be necessary to inquire into the circumstances of
                        such purchases, before dispossession is resorted to, if that should
                        ultimately prove necessary.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to confirm my telegram to you
                        of yesterday.</p>
                    <p>In this connection I wish to say that notwithstanding the announcement made
                        in your telegram of February that two troops of cavalry would be designated
                        for the purpose of guarding the legation and for garrisoning Tientsin, it
                        was stated by General Chaffee and considered settled by the legation that
                        only one company of infantry would be kept, for the time being, at Peking as
                        a legation guard. This force was held by our military authorities and the
                        legation to be ample for all requirements. Furthermore, the ground in the
                        Tartar city on which the United States can build a legation and quarters for
                        its guard is entirely inadequate if two companies, say 250 men, are to be
                        left here. Many would have to be quartered far away, and be of little use in
                        case of a riot or a sudden attack. Mr. Conger pointed this out to you in his
                        telegram of December 7 last, in which I thoroughly concur.</p>
                    <p>In view of the sufficiency of a guard of one company of infantry, and the
                        fact that it was believed on all sides that we had determined to have that
                        number, and that there is no valid reason to be found in the state of the
                        country to double it at present, I deem it would be impolitic to do so,
                        especially as some of the other powers might be disposed to avail themselves
                        of the fact to increase their already large guards and demand the indefinite
                        occupation by their troops of many public buildings, temple grounds, etc.,
                        which should be returned to the Chinese at the earliest possible date.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that after a
                        week passed without a meeting of the diplomatic corps, so as to enable the
                        commission appointed by it to prepare a body of rules to be followed in
                        passing <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0108"/>on the various claims of
                        companies, societies, and private individuals against the Chinese
                        Government, a general meeting of the corps was held to-day for consideration
                        of the report of this commission.</p>
                    <p>Before the question was, however, taken up it was deemed desirable to see if
                        any agreement could be reached by the foreign representatives as to the
                        ulterior lists of punishments which it had been agreed to demand of the
                        Chinese Government. The Russian minister immediately made a declaration that
                        under instructions from his Government he could not take any part in any
                        further discussion concerning any punishments whatever; that he had been
                        ordered by his Government to declare that it considered this subject closed
                        with the punishments already inflicted. The British minister then asked the
                        representatives if they would affirm their vote of the previous meeting, in
                        which they had decided, in principle, upon transmitting these demands to the
                        Chinese Government. This was done, and the diplomatic corps, with the
                        exception of the Russian minister, was unanimous in its decision that these
                        punishments should be asked for. The British minister added that he had
                        categorical instructions from his Government to insist on this question, and
                        his colleagues agreed that it should not be dropped. I restated the
                        President’s and your views on the subject, as contained in your telegraphic
                        instructions of February 19 and 23, but for the sake of maintaining
                        unanimity I voted with my colleagues. The representatives will now await the
                        decision of their Governments on the subject, to whom they have telegraphed
                        the declaration of the Russian minister.</p>
                    <p>The commission of the diplomatic corps intrusted with the work relating to
                        the diplomatic quarter then submitted a draft of the proclamation to be
                        published in this section of the city, requiring of the Chinese property
                        holders to show within twenty days titles to the property owned by them in
                        this section of the city, so that a basis might be found for establishing
                        the amount of the indemnification which they may be entitled to on being
                        expropriated. A Chinese official appointed by the Chinese peace
                        commissioners will assist the commissioners in this work.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese commissioners having, in a memorandum recently communicated to
                        the foreign representatives, raised objections to the public buildings
                        belonging to the Chinese Government and situated within the proposed
                        diplomatic quarter, being included in the land to be ceded to the powers,
                        the commission on the diplomatic quarter was authorized to confer with the
                        Chinese plenipotentiaries on the subject, and to endeavor to reach a
                        compromise with them.</p>
                    <p>The subject of indemnities was then taken up by the conference, and the
                        various members were asked if they had received replies from their
                        Governments to the four questions they had agreed to submit to them on
                        February 17, and which were telegraphed to you by Mr. Conger on that date. I
                        stated briefly your views on the subject and also your suggestion that, in
                        case of protracted disagreement as to the distribution of the indemnity, we
                        would accept the suggestion made by Russia, that the matter be referred to
                        the Hague Tribunal. The Russian minister stated that he was not aware that
                        his Government had actually made this proposition, that it was a mere
                        indication, and he was not prepared to say that his Government would finally
                        accept it. The British minister said categorically that his Government did
                        not favor the Hague Tribunal, and the French minister did not consider <pb
                            n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0109"/>the proposition favorably, though
                        he was willing that it should be discussed, as a possible solution in case
                        of necessity. The meeting adjourned without the report on the commission of
                        indemnities having been read, to meet again to-morrow. On my return from the
                        conference, I telegraphed you the substance of the declaration of the
                        Russian minister, and the action I had taken, and in view of the possibility
                        of the majority of the representatives agreeing within a few days on some
                        plan which may necessitate communication to the conference of the sum which
                        each power expects as war indemnity, and that which it may ask on account of
                        private claims, I renewed my request already made on March 2, that I should
                        be informed on the subject.</p>
                    <p>In the afternoon I met the Russian and British ministers, to prepare a report
                        embodying a plan for carrying out the provisions of Article V of the Joint
                        Note, concerning the interdiction of the importation of arms, etc., into
                        China. As soon as this report has been discussed by the conference I will
                        transmit a copy of it to you. From the expression of views of my colleagues,
                        I gather that it will be found absolutely impracticable to enforce this
                        prohibition. The only power which seems earnestly desirous of stringently
                        carrying it out is Russia, which has also included a similar prohibition in
                        the demands recently made by it on China at St. Petersburg.</p>

                        diplomatic corps met to-day to continue the work begun at its meeting of
                        yesterday.</p>
                    <p>Before taking up the question of indemnities, the representatives adopted a
                        draft of a letter to the Chinese plenipotentiaries, presenting, in
                        compliance with terms of the Joint Note (article 2, paragraph B), a list of
                        the towns in which the examinations must be suspended during a period of
                        five years. This subject will probably have to be discussed with the Chinese
                        plenipotentiaries, as it involves a number of questions which can not be
                        settled in a satisfactory way without having their views.</p>
                    <p>The report of the commission on the interdiction of the importation of arms,
                        etc., was read, but discussion was deferred until it had been more carefully
                        examined by each of the representatives.</p>
                    <p>The report of the commission on indemnities was then taken up, and a lengthy
                        discussion began on each paragraph of it. This discussion will be continued
                        to-morrow, when the report will probably be returned to the commission for
                        redrafting. The substance of the conclusions reached will then presumably be
                        communicated to the various governments for their approval. The conference
                        will meet again to-morrow.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The diplomatic corps finished to-day the
                        discussion of the report submitted by the commission on indemnities
                        appointed to prepare rules, or rather lay down principles, for presenting
                        the claims of societies, companies, and individuals arising out of the
                        antiforeign troubles in China of last year. The necessity for such a body of
                        rules applying alike to all private claims had been unanimously agreed to by
                        the diplomatic corps in its meeting of February 12 last. (See Procès verbal
                        of meeting of February 12, pages 2 and 3, and also that of February 16,
                        pages 2 et seq.) The commission on indemnities was appointed on 25th of
                        February, and submitted its report on the 13th of March, as I informed you
                        in my dispatch No. 41 of that date. The classification was made after a
                        careful examination of all the claims filed in the various legations.</p>
                    <p>I inclose herewith a translation of the report as finally adopted ad
                        referendum by the diplomatic corps. I will transmit the French text as soon
                        as it has been printed.</p>
                    <p>No special reference is made in the report to missions or missionaries, on
                        account of the refusal of France to waive in any wise its claimed
                        protectorate over Catholic missions and native Catholics in China. The
                        French minister, however, declared that he was willing to accept, for
                        purposes of evaluating mission claims, the principles of the report, though
                        he reserved to himself the right to follow, as to categories, precedents
                        established by treaties between France and China. In view of the above
                        declaration, Paragraph IX was added to the report.</p>
                    <p>As regards the paragraph saying that each foreign representative should fix
                        the approximate amount of the claims of his nationals, and that the sum
                        total of them would be asked of the Chinese Government without detail or
                        explanation, it is understood that the acceptance of this principle does not
                        in any way prejudice the question of the final presentation of the indemnity
                        demand on China, which has been reserved until the various representatives
                        have received instructions from their governments.</p>
                    <p>As this paragraph follows, in principle, your wish that a lump sum covering
                        all claims of whatever nature be demanded by the powers jointly of China, I
                        had no reason to oppose it, though the examination in detail of all private
                        claims by each legation will entail considerable loss of time and delay the
                        final presentation of the demand for indemnity.</p>
                    <p>The Russian minister declared that while accepting the principles of the
                        report, he would, unless otherwise instructed, present his claims
                        separately. He had made a similar statement to the diplomatic corps in the
                        meeting of February 16. (See Procès verbal of that date.)</p>
                    <p>Your views on indemnities and their presentation, contained in your various
                        telegraphic instructions to Mr. Conger, had been made known to the
                        diplomatic corps by him on February 16, and it had then been agreed that the
                        various governments should be asked if they wanted to present the claims for
                        war expenses in a lump sum with their other claims or separately. Answers
                        have not yet been received by all the representatives, but it seems probable
                        that a general lump sum will be <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0111"
                        />asked for. In this connection I refer you to the note written by the
                        Japanese minister to the conference on February 16. (See Procès verbal of
                        that date.) You will also note that the representatives were of opinion that
                        it was better to ascertain the total amount of the indemnity before
                        discussing the question of China’s ability to pay it.</p>
                    <p>I have carefully gone over the report of the commission on indemnities, in
                        the preparation of which I assisted, and do not think that any of the
                        principles will prejudice claims of American citizens, if all are similar to
                        those now on file in this legation. On the other hand, I believe that by
                        adopting certain principles for assessing claims, the total amount which
                        China will have ultimately to pay will be considerably reduced.</p>
                    <p>The general commanding the French forces, having stated that all the proceeds
                        of the sale of Chinese salt seized by his troops at Tientsin would be
                        credited to China on the amount of indemnity for war expenses, the question
                        of crediting China with all the governmental treasure and other property not
                        usually regarded as prize of war which has been seized by the foreign troops
                        was brought up before the conference, when it had disposed of the report on
                        indemnities. The Russian, British, and several other ministers stated that
                        they accepted such restitution in principle, and it was agreed that all
                        should ask the views of their governments on the subject.</p>
                    <p>The conference next heard the report prepared by the commission appointed to
                        consider the demand embodied in Article IV of the Joint Note, relating to
                        expiatory monuments in the desecrated foreign cemeteries. The commission
                        recommended that 10,000 taels be asked for each monument in each cemetery
                        desecrated in Peking, and 5,000 taels for each one of those in the
                        provinces, this sum not to prejudice claims for material losses sustained in
                        such cemeteries. The report was accepted, and it was agreed that a note
                        should be sent the Chinese plenipotentiaries embodying the above demand. The
                        meeting then adjourned to meet on the 18th to discuss the report prepared by
                        the commission on the prohibition of the importation of arms and materials
                        of war into China.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the meeting I sent you the telegram which I confirm.</p>
                    <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p>Article VI of the collective note provides:</p>
                        <p>“Equitable indemnities for governments, societies, companies, and private
                            individuals, as well as for Chinese who have suffered during the recent
                            events in their persons or property in consequence of their being in the
                            service of foreigners.”</p>
                        <p>The representatives of the powers have delegated the ministers of
                            Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, and the plenipotentiary of the United
                            States of America to elucidate this article and to lay down principles
                            to serve as a common basis for estimating and assessing claims for
                            indemnity to be presented to the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>The commission on indemnities has attempted to effect a double purpose,
                            first, to insure an equitable indemnity to those who have been injured,
                            and second, to prevent the antiforeign movement of 1900 being made use
                            of under any circumstances as a pretext for illegal gain or profit.</p>
                        <p>The commission after having studied the draft classification of
                            indemnities communicated to the diplomatic corps by the French, British,
                            and Japanese ministers, <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0112"

                            been brought to its notice, proposes the following resolutions for
                            adoption:</p>
                        <p>I. Damages shall not be claimed except in cases which are immediate and

                            1900.</p>
                        <p>II. Indemnity claims may be classified under three principal headings: <list>

                        <p>III. (1) The commission considers that the cases specified below
                            constitute an immediate and direct consequence of the events of
                            1900.</p>

                        <p>(II) The commission considers that the cases specified below ought not to
                            be considered as an immediate and direct consequence of the events of
                            1900.</p>

                            nature.</p>
                        <p>Interest on goods in stock.</p>

                        <p>Increased freight charges except in the case of contracts entered into

                        <p>To compradores, goods, being his personal property, which were lost in a
                            godown belonging to a foreigner.</p>
                        <p>IV. Claims for damages should in every case be addressed to the
                            representative of the power which exercises protection over the
                            claimant.</p>
                        <p>Claims of an international character are to be addressed to the dean of
                            the diplomatic body.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of the powers, after examination of the claims
                            preferred by the persons under their protection, shall make an
                            approximate estimate of the amount and shall demand the sum total
                            without giving either details or explanation to the Chinese
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>V. (I) Damages shall be assessed as far as possible and in conformity
                            with the above-mentioned principles, with a view to putting governments,
                            societies, companies, and private individuals back in the position in
                            which they would have been if the anti-foreign movement of 1900 had not
                            taken place.</p>
                        <p>The valuation of articles for which damages are asked shall be just and
                            reasonable and in conformity with the real expenditure which would be
                            necessary to replace them.</p>
                        <p>(II) The amount of the indemnities can not in any case be augmented by
                            interest at more than 5 per cent on personal claims and 7 per cent on
                            commercial claims. Interest can only be allowed if it represents a loss
                            actually incurred, and which shall have been proved in accordance with
                            Article VII, given below. It will be calculated from the day on which
                            the wrong entitling the compensation took place.</p>
                        <p>VI. If societies or companies or private individuals have been required
                            by the military authorities to furnish articles, furniture, real estate,
                            or goods belonging to them for the necessities of common defense, the
                            government exercising authority over the officer or officers who have
                            signed such requisition or have certified to the correctness <pb n="108"
                                xml:id="pg_108" facs="0114"/>of the bills shall be directly
                            responsible for their reimbursement, with a corresponding right against
                            China.</p>
                        <p>VII. Proof of damage suffered shall be made to the satisfaction of the
                            foreign representative to whom the claim is addressed, in conformity
                            with the laws and usages of his country.</p>
                        <p>The proof that the articles existed prior to the events which led to the
                            claim being presented shall be furnished in every case to the
                            satisfaction of the representative of the power concerned.</p>
                        <p>In examination of the different claims for indemnity for the loss of
                            personal property it is desirable that the style of living and the
                            presumable income of the claimant should be taken into account.</p>
                        <p>VIII. The Commission considers that the indemnities should be calculated
                            in Hai-kwan taels.</p>
                        <p>IX. The Commission considers that the principles enumerated above should
                            serve as a basis for assessing all claims for compensation, without
                            distinction.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>; The diplomatic corps in its meeting held
                        to-day devoted all its time to a desultory discussion of various points
                        relating to the report of the commission on indemnities, which it had
                        adopted <hi rend="italic">ad referendum</hi> in its meeting of the 14th.</p>
                    <p>The British minister having proposed to the meeting that, following the
                        precedent of the Constantinople conference of 1896, the representatives
                        should submit to the conference <hi rend="italic">pro forma</hi> the amounts
                        they proposed asking of China for each specific claim of their nationals,
                        and also the amount of their claim for war expenses, etc., the Austrian
                        minister offered as an amendment that they should submit only the total
                        amounts of each of the three categories of claims, i. e., state, companies
                        and societies, private individuals. I then suggested as a further amendment
                        that each power submit to the conference a lump sum covering all its claims,
                        governmental, companies and societies, and private ones. This amendment was
                        voted on, although at the last meeting the question had been reserved for
                        future consideration, most of the representatives being without
                        instructions. Six of the representatives, including France, Japan, and
                        Russia, were in favor of my amendment, but the ministers of Great Britain,
                        Germany, and Italy voted against it. Though the vote was an informal one,
                        which may not affect the final settlement of the question of the
                        presentation of the demand for indemnity to the Chinese Government, I deemed
                        it sufficiently interesting to mention it in my telegram to you of this
                        date.</p>
                    <p>I still believe a lump-sum indemnity will be asked, and that we will be able
                        to secure, in conformity with your wishes, a horizontal scaling down of the
                        claims to within China’s ability to pay.</p>
                    <p>On my motion, the conference fixed the 1st of May, subject to the approval of
                        their Governments, as the latest date at which private claims should be
                        filed here. This will, in my opinion, hasten the final presentation to China
                        of the indemnity demanded, though some of the powers seem embarrassed over
                        the question of the cost of future military occupation in calculating their
                        demand for war expenses.</p>
                    <p>I inclose herewith a translation of a letter from the Chinese
                        plenipotentiaries to the dean of the diplomatic corps, read by him at this
                        meeting, relating to the indemnification of Chinese residents in the <pb
                            n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0115"/>proposed diplomatic quarter. The
                        draft of a reply was agreed upon by the representatives, and a copy thereof
                        is inclosed. The question of the diplomatic quarter seems likely to give a
                        great deal of trouble, and will not probably be settled for some time to
                        come, though in the meanwhile the various powers are busy building quarters
                        for guards, and new legations.</p>
                    <p>I have the honor, etc.,</p>

                        <p>We had the honor to receive on the 15th instant your communication with
                            reference to the execution of Article VII of the joint note.</p>
                        <p>(Quotes in extenso doyen’s note of March 15, 1901.)</p>
                        <p>In your communication of the 1st instant, transmitting a plan of the
                            proposed legation quarter, you made certain remarks on the subject of
                            the Chinese resident within its limits.</p>
                        <p>On receipt thereof we prepared and sent you a memorandum, in which we
                            stated that in the interest of justice steps must be taken to make good
                            to the Chinese resident in the legation quarter, who would be called
                            upon to move elsewhere, the value of their land and their expenses of
                            removal.</p>
                        <p>Now, what we meant thereby was that the Plenipotentiaries of the powers
                            themselves ought, as a matter of course, to take steps to provide for
                            any sums necessary to make good such claims. It is a fixed and abiding
                            principle that he who appropriates land for his own use must pay for the
                            same, and that he who calls on them to remove their dwellings must make
                            good the expenses of such removal. In the present instance, as the
                            legations wish to extend their boundaries, such Chinese as are resident
                            within these limits must move elsewhere, and, as in your former
                            communication it is stated that such area is reserved for the use of the
                            legations, it undoubtedly follows that the legations are responsible for
                            the payment of the value of the land thus appropriated. Further, as the
                            legations had called upon the present residents to quit, they put these
                            people to the expense of taking down their dwellings and reerecting
                            them, a process which is accompanied by inevitable loss of property and
                            damage of various kinds. These losses being the result of orders to
                            quit, the reimbursement thereof ought naturally also to be made by the
                            legations concerned.</p>
                        <p>It is now, however, proposed that the Chinese Government be asked to
                            provide funds for this purpose. Taking all the circumstances into
                            consideration we can hardly bring ourselves to believe that a proposal
                            of this kind is in accordance with equity.</p>
                        <p>As regards the request in the communication under acknowledgment, that an
                            officer be appointed to assist in the examination of title deeds and
                            assessment of values, this is of a truth a just and proper method of
                            procedure, and affords evidence of a really sincere desire to preserve
                            the interests of the proprietor from injury.</p>
                        <p>It is our duty in addressing to you this reply to beg you to consult with
                            the Representatives of the powers regarding the question of refunding to
                            the Chinese owners the value of their lands and expenses of removal,
                            with a view to securing an acknowledgment of the just principle that

                            15th of March, I had the honor to request you to designate a delegate to
                            examine, with a commission named for that purpose by the representatives
                            of the powers, the validity of deeds to real estate <pb n="110"
                                xml:id="pg_110" facs="0116"/>owned by Chinese within the limits of
                            the future diplomatic quarter. I informed you that this commission and
                            the delegate you will choose would also have for duty to fix the value
                            of the lots to be expropriated, so as to settle the damages which the
                            Imperial Government would have to grant the owners of them.</p>
                        <p>You answered me on the 16th of this month that it belonged to the
                            legations to indemnify the Chinese who would be expropriated by them.
                            You pretended in that communication that the pulling down and
                            destruction of buildings which has been done in the diplomatic quarter
                            were imputable to the legations, as was also the moving away from it of
                            the inhabitants, who have been obliged to abandon their dwellings.</p>
                        <p>The events of last year are still too recent for it to be possible to
                            represent things in this light.</p>
                        <p>Why did the Emperor of China, in accepting the joint note, grant the
                            legations the right to put themselves in a defensive state, unless it
                            was because they had been invested and besieged for two months,
                            surrounded by regulars and Boxers, who pulled down several of them and
                            destroyed by fire the whole quarter surrounding them?</p>
                        <p>Who ignores that when the allied troops entered into Peking the whole
                            section of the city which the powers demand to establish their
                            diplomatic missions in had been mined and burned and was only a heap of
                            ruins, the work of Boxers and regulars?</p>
                        <p>It is the Chinese Government, declared responsible of these events by the
                            powers, and which has recognized itself as such in accepting their
                            conditions, that should bear the consequences of its conduct and to
                            supply to the diplomatic agents, to which it has a duty to insure, the
                            means of defense which it has rendered necessary in failing to keep its
                            first obligations. Among these means of defense figures in first line
                            the removing of the houses which served as a place of refuge to those
                            attacking the legations and the walls of which have shielded their
                            attacks against the representatives of the powers.</p>
                        <p>As, however, it would be unjust to deprive of their dwellings Chinese who
                            have no responsibility in the affair, and who would as a result be
                            victims of an event which they could not prevent, the diplomatic corps
                            proposes to you to fix with it the reasonable damages which “you will
                            have to pay the inhabitants who can show good titles to their
                            property.</p>
                        <p>The diplomatic corps can only insist on its demand, and my colleagues
                            direct me to beg you to designate, as soon as possible, the delegate who
                            will put himself in communication with the commission which it has
                            appointed.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to confirm my telegram to you
                        of this date.</p>
                    <p>It was written after a conversation with General Chaffee, in which he told me
                        that he had received orders to begin withdrawing his troops from China,
                        except one company to be left as a legation guard, by the end of April.</p>
                    <p>In the present state of negotiations, when the question of the evacuation of
                        Peking and the adjacent country, the occupation of the lines of
                        communication with the sea, the razing of the forts, the defense of the
                        proposed legation quarter, and a number of other important questions are
                        still unsettled, though within appreciable distance of settlement, the
                        withdrawal of all our forces would unquestionably place us in any discussion
                        on these points in a position of great disadvantage with the other powers
                        having large forces here—we would practically have no voice whatever in
                        these matters.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the powers with many troops would thereby acquire still further
                        influence by taking over the part of the city now under <pb n="111"
                            xml:id="pg_111" facs="0117"/>our control, and be able to exercise as
                        they might see fit pressure on the Chinese Government to obtain their
                        particular ends.</p>
                    <p>With even a small force of American troops here we can exercise a constant
                        and salutary pressure on the other powers in the interest of the prompt
                        reestablishment of order and the return of the administration of this
                        province to China; without them we will be able to do but little.</p>
                    <p>The administration of the quarters of Peking under American control has been
                        excellent and gives satisfaction to foreigners and Chinese alike.</p>
                    <p>I submitted the above considerations to General Chaffee and a number of other
                        arguments along the same line in favor of maintaining here for at least the
                        next few months a considerable force of our troops. I have also shown the
                        general a copy of the telegram sent you to-day.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The diplomatic corps in its meeting of this
                        morning discussed the report of the commission appointed to consider the
                        means deemed necessary for enforcing the provisions of Article V of the
                        Joint Note (prohibition of arms and ammunition, etc.).</p>
                    <p>The report, after being slightly amended, was adopted <hi rend="italic">ad
                            referendum</hi> and ordered to be printed. I will transmit a copy of it
                        to you in a few days. It simply embodies the views of the foreign
                        representatives as to the measures they deem indispensable to be taken, if
                        the powers agree to endeavor to prevent the introduction of arms, etc., into
                        China. It seems to be highly improbable that any of them will be willing to
                        accept its recommendations, as they conflict with a number of principles of
                        international law of great importance and are impossible in execution.</p>
                    <p>The report provides for the enforcement of the prohibition for renewable
                        terms of five years. The Japanese and Belgian ministers and myself were in
                        favor of terms of two years, contending that it was possible that within the
                        first term of two years conditions might be such in China that it would not
                        be necessary to any longer prohibit the importation of arms. The Russian
                        minister, on the contrary, wanted the term fixed at ten years.</p>
                    <p>It appearing urgent to the diplomatic corps that the question of the razing
                        of the forts and military occupation (Articles VIII and IX of Joint Note)
                        should be settled at an early date, it was decided that before proceeding to
                        consider them it was imperative that each of the powers should state whether
                        it proposed to take part in the military measures their carrying out would
                        necessitate. Each of the representatives agreed to submit the question to
                        his Government in the terms of my telegram to you of this date.</p>
                    <p>The German minister informed his colleagues that he had received from his
                        Government the figure of the war indemnity it proposed <pb n="112"
                            xml:id="pg_112" facs="0118"/>demanding of China, and he asked if the
                        other representatives were in possession of like data from their
                        Governments. The representatives of France, Austria, Belgium, Holland, and
                        myself were the only ones who had received instructions on the subject.</p>
                    <p>It was, however, agreed that it was necessary to take up without further
                        delay the study of the financial resources of China for the payment of the
                        indemnities, and a committee will be appointed for that purpose on the 22d
                        instant.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The question of the presentation of the
                        ulterior list of punishments for those officials and other persons shown to
                        have taken a direct part in the massacres of last summer was brought to-day
                        before the diplomatic corps by the British minister, who, under instructions
                        from his Government, is most pressing in his demands for its presentation to
                        the Chinese Government. Prior to the meeting of the diplomatic corps the six
                        ministers who had persons of their nationalities killed last year met to
                        revise the lists of punishments previously prepared, and on which figure 10
                        demands for capital punishment. This latter list was carefully gone over and
                        the number of such punishments reduced to four, and for the other six the
                        punishment was commuted into that which has been inflicted on Prince Tuan
                        and Duke Lan. All the minor demands, amounting to about 89, and which
                        figured on the first list, were maintained. The revised list was then
                        submitted to the whole of the diplomatic corps and it was asked whether it
                        agreed to transmit it to the Chinese plenipotentiaries. The Russian minister
                        reaffirmed his declaration made previously that his Government considered
                        the question of punishments closed. All the other representatives agreed to
                        send the demand, but as some of them declared themselves in favor of sending
                        a joint note and others identic ones, no final agreement could be reached,
                        and they cabled to their Governments for instruction. The British minister,
                        who expressed himself strongly in favor of a joint note, stated that in case
                        this was not finally agreed upon his Government reserved to itself the right
                        to present the original demands—that is to say, for 10 capital
                        punishments—to the Chinese Government, even if it had to do so alone.</p>
                    <p>As I telegraphed you to-day, I shall, unless otherwise instructed by you,
                        vote in favor of a joint note. I am strongly of opinion that a demand for
                        further punishments should be made on the Chinese Government. In the first
                        place, because some punishment should be inflicted on a number of guilty
                        provincial officials. * * * I have, however, stated that I will accept any
                        form of punishment agreed upon, and will in no case insist on death
                        penalty.</p>
                    <p>The question of a demand for punishments having been for the time laid aside,
                        the diplomatic corps took up the discussion of a set of police regulations
                        for the diplomatic quarter. This contemplates the organization of an
                        international police, and provides for a number of measures which, under
                        existing conditions here, seem to me most impracticable. <pb n="113"
                            xml:id="pg_113" facs="0119"/>I stated to my colleagues that if they
                        would agree to call the section of the city which the Chinese Government has
                        been asked to cede to the powers an international settlement and organize in
                        it some form of municipal government I would agree to any proposition they
                        might submit, otherwise that I must decline to agree to any arrangements
                        such as they contemplated by the regulations under discussion. No action was
                        taken.</p>
                    <p>A committee consisting of the British, French, German, and Japanese ministers
                        was then appointed to consider the financial resources of China, with a view
                        to the payment of the indemnity which will be demanded. The conference then
                        adjourned <hi rend="italic">sine die</hi>, but will probably meet about the
                        middle of next week.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit herewith, for
                        your information, two memoranda, one prepared by Sir Ernest Satow, British
                        minister to China, the other by-Sir Robert Hart, and both bearing on the
                        question of the available revenue from which China could pay the indemnity
                        which will shortly be asked of it by the powers.</p>
                    <p>Some of the foreign representatives here are advocating in the strongest
                        manner that China should contract a foreign loan for the payment of the
                        indemnity. Though this would be the most rapid way of paying it off, it
                        would also be the most expensive. It would inevitably result in establishing
                        some form of foreign international financial control, affect thereby the
                        administrative entity of China, and consequently conflict with the declared
                        policy of the United States. Though Russia is, I am given to understand,
                        strongly opposed to China making a loan which would result, according to
                        Russia’s views, in further strengthening British influence in China, the
                        powers are so anxious to be promptly paid for their military expenses, that
                        I fear great pressure will be brought to force this country to follow this
                        method in paying off her new indebtedness.</p>
                    <p>The suggestions of Sir Ernest Satow and Sir Robert Hart’s memoranda, by which
                        existing revenue only would be used to pay off by installments the
                        indemnity, would be much better for China and the adoption of most of the
                        measures they propose would contribute to bring about much needed
                        administrative reforms, and ultimately constitute for the sole benefit of
                        China, let it be hoped, valuable sources of revenue. For these reasons the
                        measures herein advocated strongly commend themselves to me, and I have no
                        doubt they will do so also to you.</p>
                    <p>It has been rumored here of late that some American capitalists were willing
                        to supply China with all the money she might need in her present
                        embarrassment, on condition that the administration of certain of China’s
                        present revenues be farmed out to them for an extended term of years. Any
                        such attempt to secure control over <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0120"
                        />the larger part of China’s revenues, and thereby over the Government of
                        China, would be strongly opposed by all the other powers out here, and I
                        think not unnaturally. So strong I think would be the opposition that it
                        seems to me it would be quite impossible to carry out this plan. The
                        development of China’s resources and improvement in her methods of
                        administration will tend more than anything else to increase her commerce,
                        and will, therefore, be ultimately much more beneficial to us and the world
                        at large than any other plan which can be thought of for the settlement of
                        its new financial obligations.</p>

                        <p>We are without any indications as to the probable total amount of the
                            indemnities which will be claimed from China, except such estimates as
                            have been brought forward in the legislature of certain powers, but it
                            seems reasonable to assume that the sum will not fall far short of
                            £50,000,000 and may possibly exceed those figures.</p>
                        <p>Assuming, however, for the moment that this round sum represents the
                            total, the next question is how can this be provided for.</p>
                        <p>Immediate payment or payment spread over a short period would meet the
                            convenience of the powers, but it is obvious that this is impossible
                            without having resort to a foreign loan.</p>
                        <p>It has been recently estimated that in order to provide only £40,000,000
                            in cash, China would, in the present state of her credit, have to
                            contract for a loan of £55,000,000, and at the same rate for £50,000,000
                            in cash she would have to contract for £68,750,000. The amount she would
                            have to provide for the first fifteen years (assuming the terms to be
                            the same as those of the loan effected after the war with Japan) would
                            be somewhat over £5,500,000. For the next succeeding fifteen years it
                            would be about one-third less, after which there would be a still
                            further diminution.</p>
                        <p>This seems to be considerably in excess of what she could afford to pay
                            without increasing taxation to a burdensome amount or taking such a
                            proportion of the total revenue of China as would drive the Government
                            into bankruptcy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. George Jamieson, at page 33 of his report (1897), estimates the total
                            revenue at 88,000,000 taels, from which must be deducted nearly
                            22,000,000, being the foreign customs revenue, the whole of which is
                            hypothecated for the payment of the existing debt. This leaves
                            66,000,000 or £11,000,000, and according to the hypothesis of this
                            one-half must be devoted during the first fifteen years to the payment
                            of debt. To state this is to demonstrate its impossibility.</p>
                        <p>Whether for the credit of China that of the powers can be substituted by
                            some means or other I will not now stop to inquire, but confine myself
                            to the question of what resources are available, which by improved
                            methods of collecting might be made to yield more than at present
                            without increasing the burden on the taxpayer.</p>
                        <p>In Mr. Jamieson’s report above referred to (p. 33), the revenue from the
                            native customs is set down at 1,000,000, which (p. 30) he considers an
                            absolutely insignificant amount, and the inference is that if the
                            returns were honestly made it would yield a much larger sum. Mr.
                            Hippisley, in an address delivered before the Johns Hopkins University,
                            in November last, put the actual revenue from this source at 3,000,000
                            taels, and as he is a member of the Imperial maritime customs service it
                            may be assumed with a fair show of probability that his estimate is more
                            likely to be Correct than that of Mr. Jamieson, who had not the same
                            means of access to official sources of information. The same remark,
                            however, applies to this larger estimate, namely, that an honest system
                            of collection would produce a considerably larger amount. It seems
                            consequently that to estimate the yield obtainable at 4,000,000 taels
                            would not be excessive.</p>
                        <p>The next item of revenue which by common consent seems to be regarded as
                            the most easily available is the salt excise. Mr. Jamieson puts this at
                            13,659,000 taels (p. 33 of his report), while Mr. Hippisley estimates it
                            at only 12,000,000. It is, as is <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0121"
                            />well known, capable of producing a much larger sum, which at the very
                            lowest estimate may be put at 50 per cent higher, say 16,000,000 taels.
                            But from two other sources of information, independent of each other, it
                            appears that a surplus of 12,000,000 taels is an equally plausible
                            estimate of the gain to be expected from an honest administration.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, there is the item of the tribute rice sent to Peking from the
                            south (p. 6 of Mr. Jamieson’s report). The amount sent forward he
                            estimates at 1,200,000 to 1,400,000 piculs; the charges and allowance
                            for transport cost the provinces a very large sum, which he estimates at
                            1,500,000 taels.</p>
                        <p>According to another estimate the tribute rice amounts to 800,000 piculs,
                            value, 4 taels a picul. Forty per cent of this is transported by the
                            Grand Canal, the charges being so high as to make the laid-down cost in
                            Peking about 15 taels, while the freight on the remaining 60 per cent
                            carried in the steamers of the China Merchant Company is only 1½ taels a
                            picul. If the whole were transported by sea the resulting economy would
                            amount to 9½ taels or 40 per cent on 800,000 piculs, or 3,040,000 taels.
                            Another estimate gives 300,000 piculs carried by steamer and laid down
                            at 6 taels, and 400,000 piculs transported by the Grand Canal at 15
                            taels, the economy effected by carrying the whole by sea would then be
                            3,600,000. The viceroys who dispatch the rice pay the freight in the
                            first instance and deduct it from the proportion of the land tax which
                            they remit to Peking.</p>
                        <p>It should be explained that the “tribute rice” is rice purchased by the
                            officials with money received in commutation of taxes in kind. The funds
                            employed in this way reach from 3,360,000 to 3,920,000 taels according
                            to Mr. Jamieson’s estimate of the amount of tribute rice. The rice is
                            eventually doled out to the Manchu banner men, who sell it for
                            consumption by the poorer classes in Peking, realizing about 1½ taels a
                            picul. No more wasteful proceeding than the foregoing could be
                            imagined.</p>
                        <p>If the money expended in the purchase of the “tribute rice” were kept in
                            hand, and if to that were added the saving on transport, we should
                            obtain a sum of about 6,562,000 taels, according to Mr. Jamieson, or if
                            the other estimates were taken, the result will be as follows: <table

                        <p>A further economy might be effected by capitalizing the pensions to
                            Manchu soldiers and banner men and issuing to them bonds bearing
                            interest at 5 per cent. The official return for Peking alone is
                            5,760,000 taels, without taking into account the cost of the Manchu
                            garrisons in the provinces. It must be remembered that these men are not
                            of any use as soldiers. If the bonds issued to the recipients of these
                            pensions were to the amount of half the capitalized value, this would
                            for Peking alone effect a saving of 2,830,000 taels. The prohibition to
                            engage in trade which affects them should at the same time be
                            removed.</p>

                        <p>As to the administration of these sources of revenue, it seems obvious
                            that the native customs should be placed under the Imperial maritime
                            customs. As to the others, the question of how they should be collected
                            and paid over is a matter for future consideration.</p>
                        <p>It may possibly seem that the foregoing estimates of available sources of
                            revenue is too sanguine. What may be regarded as a rather pessimistic

                        <p>Its framer proposes, therefore, that the present import duties should be
                            raised to an effective 5 per cent, being at present only 3.17 per cent
                            effective, and estimates the yield from this to be about 2,700,000
                            taels, while from duty-free goods, excepting foreign cereals or rice,
                            420,000 taels might be obtained. This gives altogether 8,280,000, or
                            say, in round numbers, 9,000,000 taels.</p>
                        <p>This would suffice, it is evident, for the service of a loan of
                            £30,000,000 nominal, producing, say, £23,000,000 cash.</p>
                        <p>If the present specific tariff is to be brought up to 5 per cent actual
                            ad valorem, it seems just and reasonable that a similar provision should
                            be made with regard to land frontier customs duties.</p>

                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) China has no reserve and can not pay ready
                            money.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) The amount required must therefore be taken
                            either from the savings of the people or from the current revenues of
                            the Government.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) No statistics show the wealth of the people,
                            but even admitting the possibility of finding the required sum in their
                            hands and clearing off the entire indemnity by one payment, the attempt
                            to collect it would unsettle every province and end in failure.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) It is therefore from revenues payment must be
                            made.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) The latest statement of revenue and
                            expenditure, compiled from what remains of the records of the Hu Pu
                            board of revenue, makes revenue amount to about 88,000,000 taels, while
                            expenditure was said to require 101,000,000. More than a quarter of the
                            revenue was paid out for the service of existing loans, and as for the
                            deficit or difference between requirements and receipts, it is still a
                            debt; there are no funds to meet it. The appropriation of so much
                            revenue for existing loans is in fact the cause of the deficit, for all
                            such loan payments are deductions from the fund the Government relied on
                            to meet the expenses of provincial and metropolitan administration. New
                            revenues were not created to meet new expenditure. Accordingly, any
                            further withdrawal of funds from revenue means an additional deficit,
                            and the total deficit must then either become an increasing debt ending
                            in national bankruptcy or be made up for either by additional taxation
                            or by a mixture of that and economy in the use of funds. Economics are
                            not easily effected, and as for new taxes, they are difficult to impose
                            and do not at once pay for the cost of collection. Officials, official
                            establishments, and governmental work generally will be embarrassed by
                            hasty or ill-considered attempts to economize; new taxes are never
                            popular and give underlings opportunities for extortion; an official
                            economy which would impair the efficiency of national administration and
                            a taxation which would weaken either the productive or the consumptive
                            power of the people are alike to be condemned. These considerations can
                            not be set aside when attempting to answer the question, What amount can
                            China pay? For, seeing that the present revenue does not suffice for the
                            ordinary work of Government, fresh taxes must be imposed to make up for
                            whatever revenue a new indemnity will withdraw.</p>

                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">h</hi>) Taking the population of China at 400,000,000
                            and the revenue collected and expended at 100,000,000, the Government
                            may be said to cost the people annually 25 tael cents each. If these
                            figures are to be considered net results, and a similar amount allowed
                            for cost of collection and extortion—an allowance which is probably
                            excessive—the result would still be a taxation of only 50 tael cents
                            apiece. Japanese pay 7 silver dollars and Americans 15 gold dollars. It
                            may therefore be said that whatever abuses exist, no people are more
                            lightly taxed and no government more economically conducted than the
                            Chinese; but this is what Confucian teaching requires. On the other
                            hand, it must be remembered that while living is cheap, wages are low;
                            and that while, accidents apart, people every where have enough, and
                            just enough, to live on, the national currency—copper cash—at the rate
                            of 1,000 cash to the silver dollar, is so well suited to Chinese
                            environment that in every market place a single cash can buy something.
                            Therefore, although living is cheap and taxation light, it would be a
                            mistake to suppose that new taxation would meet with no objection and
                            cause no suffering, while it is also a fact that to the ordinary Chinese
                            mind relatively heavy taxation is distasteful as being, first of all,
                            opposed to the moral sentiment of the country and also affording
                            unscrupulous collectors opportunities to harass productive
                            industries.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">i</hi>) With these considerations in view, and bearing
                            in mind the fact that experience now shows that the Government, although
                            in difficulties, is just able to support the deficit existing loans
                            cause, it may be inferred that additional indemnity payments, to be made
                            up for by additional taxation, ought not to exceed present charges—that
                            is, ought to be as much below 20,000,000 taels a year as possible, and
                            ought not to exceed that amount; and this is my answer to the first
                            question, What amount can China pay?</p>
                        <p>2. What method of payment is most suitable?</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Under the circumstances there is apparently a
                            choice between only two, viz, for China to borrow the amount, or for
                            foreign Governments to accept payment in annual installments.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) If China appears in the market as a borrower,
                            the banks will charge heavy commissions—the rate of issue will require
                            to be low to tempt investors—and the public will be hard to satisfy in
                            respect of guarantees and conditions. This method would prove a very
                            costly one for China, and initial difficulties connected with guarantees
                            and considerations would only increase with the delay discussion must
                            entail.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) If, on the other hand, foreign Governments
                            would consent to accept the undertaking of the Chinese Government to
                            make payment in so many annual installments, the transaction would be
                            cheaper for China and the details could be more speedily settled. For
                            instance, supposing the total of the indemnity principal to be
                            £50,000,000, and China to undertake to pay 5 per cent on that amount
                            for, say, thirty years, or £2,500,000 (17,500,000 taels) annually, the
                            Governments concerned could either collectively or individually float an
                            indemnity loan on their own account, and with its proceeds at once pay
                            off the indemnities of Governments, corporations, and individuals. In
                            this way foreign Governments and China would be mutually creditor and
                                <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0124"/>debtor; monthly payments
                            would be made to the banks as designated at Shanghai, and the banks
                            could then surrender the Chinese bonds for monthly payments to the
                            Chinese Government through the legations concerned.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) Of the two methods, the second is the more
                            acceptable from the Chinese point of view.</p>
                        <p>3. What revenues can most easily be taken?</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The maritime customs revenue is at once the
                            simplest and the best known Chinese guarantee, but as it is already
                            pledged for existing loans it is not on this occasion available as a
                            collateral security.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) The choice is therefore between the land tax,
                            the likin, and the salt gabelle.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) The land tax, although a staple asset, is
                            remitted from time to time, when crops are damaged by locusts, droughts,
                            inundations, or earthquakes, and, being thus variable, can not be relied
                            on to produce the same amount every year.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) Likin is a temporary tax which both the
                            Chinese people and foreign commerce would gladly see abolished, and it
                            would therefore be better not to pledge the Government to continue
                            it.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) The remaining tax, the salt gabelle, is an
                            unobjectionable item of revenue, and nothing more reliable exists. The
                            net collection of 1899, according to the board of revenue’s figures, was
                            under 14,000,000 taels, but various inquiries go to show that 15,000,000
                            might be expected, and that careful handling might even raise it to
                            20,000,000. But it would be best to supplement this gabelle by the
                            native customs revenue—that is, the dues and duties paid by Chinese
                            junks, etc. The board’s figures give the total net collection as
                            something under 3,000,000 taels, but inquiry affords reason to suppose
                            that at the treaty ports alone it could be increased to 5,000,000, while
                            some think it might grow even to 10,000,000. Lest the salt gabelle and
                            the native customs should fail to produce the full annual total
                            required, it might be well to specify some other convenient items. For
                            example, the Peking octroi could be relied on for almost 500,000 taels
                            annually; metropolitan expenditure might contribute 3,000,000 taels from
                            the Manchu allowances, and from 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 more might be
                            realized by abolishing the Peking grain tribute in kind. Thus salt
                            gabelle, native customs, Peking octroi, metropolitan expenditure, and
                            grain tribute could be relied upon to produce the first year a clear
                            total of 20,000,000, and in a few years perhaps 30,000,000, and this is
                            my answer to the question, What revenues can most easily be taken?</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) But before leaving this point it should be
                            remarked that the revenue thus proposed to be set apart would be revenue
                            deducted from funds the Government absolutely requires the use of for
                            the current expenditure of the administration, and must be made up for
                            by new or additional taxation in other directions. How could this be
                            done? The matter has already formed the subject of several consultations
                            between myself and Chinese officials, and the additional taxes proposed
                            which find favor so far are a house tax, a stamp duty, and rearrangement
                            of native opium duties. A house tax, to produce 20,000,000 taels a year,
                            would be a charge of only 5 tael cents annually on each of the
                            population, but it is likely that such a tax would yield several times
                            that amount; that it would not be too heavy if fixed at a half month’s
                            rent, and that if made payable by all occupants direct to the yamen of
                            the district magistrate the dishonesty or extortion of visiting
                            collectors could be successfully combated. A stamp duty would also in
                            time produce a considerable revenue. There are about 2,000 districts in
                            the eighteen provinces, and it is estimated that each of these would use
                            at least 1,000 stamps daily for bills, receipts, deeds, bank notes, pawn
                            tickets, etc.; if each stamp were sold for 10 copper cash, or one
                            dollar-cent, the yield at that rate would be about 5,000,000 taels a
                            year. As regards native opium, it is calculated that there are at least
                            150,000 piculs, or three times the quantity of foreign opium, produced
                            and disposed of every year; were the district magistrates charged with
                            the collection of the duty, and duty fixed at 60 taels a picul, the
                            collection, under improved regulations, ought to amount to some
                            10,000,000 taels a year. These three taxes, properly managed, should
                            yield a very large revenue and quite suffice to make up for the
                            withdrawal of the salt gabelle, etc., from administrative expenditure
                            for indemnity purposes; but although they would not fall heavily on any
                            body, the very fact of their being newly imposed would make them
                            unwelcome, and under the circumstances their unpopularity would connect
                            itself with their foreign origin, and in that way cause some ill feeling
                            it might be wiser to avoid.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) There is, however, an alternative method which
                            would give some relief, and which, therefore, under present
                            circumstances seems worthy of consideration. When the foreign tariff
                            came into operation forty years ago the haikwan or customs tael, in
                            which duties were and are payable, was worth 6 shillings 8 pence English
                            money—that is, 3 haikwan taels were equal to £1. Since that date silver
                            has declined in value, and instead of 3 about 7 haikwan taels must now
                            be given for the pound sterling. The principle on which the tariff was
                            drawn up was to fix duties at the rate of 5 per <pb n="119"
                                xml:id="pg_119" facs="0125"/>cent on values, but the result of the
                            fall in silver is that instead of paying 5 per cent on value most goods
                            now pay only from 2 to 3 per cent, while many even pay but 1 or 2 per
                            cent, and a further result has been that both the Chinese revenue has
                            been a loser arid the Chinese Government a sufferer. All this could be
                            set right at a stroke simply by returning to the tariff value of the
                            customs tael, and such a step would require neither revision, change,
                            nor negotiation, a declaration by the treaty powers to the effect that
                            the tael of the tariff means 6 shillings 8 pence English money, or its
                            equivalent in any other national coin, and that duties must be paid
                            accordingly, would suffice. The effect of this on the revenue of the
                            Maritime Customs would be to increase the collection by from 10,000,000
                            to 15,000,000 taels, almost enough to provide for the new indemnities,
                            and merchandise would not be taxed beyond the 5 per cent rate on values.
                            Such additional collection would be maritime customs revenue; it would
                            not require any new machinery for its management, while it would be a
                            simpler and more easily handled security than the others designated.</p>
                        <p>4. What control is advisable?</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The discussion of this point is, of course,
                            outside my province.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) But I may remark that the plan adopted under
                            the Tientsin treaties for controlling indemnity payments was simply for
                            the consuls concerned to repair to the custom-house at the end of each
                            quarter and inspect the revenue statements. This was a useful formality
                            at the start, but it soon became a mere formality and had no special
                            effect on either the accuracy of revenue statements or the payment of
                            indemnity money.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) If the salt gabelle, etc., are specified as
                            the guarantees for payment of new indemnities, I may point out that the
                            simplest solution would be the extension of the present likin control
                            under the 4½ per cent loan agreements to the salt gabelle generally and
                            the incorporation of the native customs at the treaty ports with the
                            maritime customs there established. The existence of two custom-houses
                            at the same port occasions mistakes and causes friction, and the
                            maritime customs staff could easily assume charge of the work now in the
                            hands of the chang shui or native customs. As regards the salt gabelle,
                            it should be explained that the Chinese practice is to collect the tax
                            at the place of consumption, and procedure is arranged accordingly. Any
                            change would dislocate existing machinery, cause loss of revenue, and
                            inconvenience both traders and public. Supervision of the kind already
                            initiated would suffice, for the results of a four years’ experiment
                            prove that it works smoothly and adequately. The revenue pledged has
                            been regularly forthcoming and there has been no default, and whenever
                            any local delay has occurred orders from Pekin have at once rectified
                            it. The amounts collected for payment of new indemnities ought to be
                            sent to the banks monthly, but as collections vary from day to day the
                            annual quota is the only one to be rigidly adhered to.</p>

                        consider a number of pending questions relating to the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>The French minister submitted the following proposition to govern in
                        estimating the claims for legation guards and volunteers, which were agreed
                        to <hi rend="italic">ad referendum:</hi>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>As regards killed or wounded soldiers, in case a claim is to be made

                                paid said soldier or his family according to the laws of his
                                country.</p>
                            <p>As regards volunteers killed or having been wounded so as to
                                incapacitate them for work, the indemnity to be asked shall be
                                calculated on the position (situation) of said volunteer and the

                    </p>
                    <p>As, however, these classes of claims come under the heading of “Claims of
                        Governments,” according to the report of the committee of indemnities, I
                        think these propositions are of no special value or importance.</p>
                    <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0126"/>
                    <p>The question was then put to the various representatives as to the acceptance
                        by their Governments of the report of the Committee on indemnities, copy of
                        which report was inclosed in my No. 42 of the 14th instant. The
                        representatives of Russia, France, Germany, and Holland informed the meeting
                        that their Governments had accepted it, conditionally, of course, on its
                        acceptance by all the powers. I stated to my colleagues that I did not
                        expect my Government to express an opinion on the subject until our proposal
                        asking for a general lump indemnity to be divided among the powers
                        proportionately to their losses and expenses had been passed upon. This
                        proposal I communicated formally to the diplomatic corps in a memorandum
                        dated the 28th of March. I inclose a copy herewith.</p>
                    <p>The British minister then asked the meeting to agree to extend the limit of
                        time for the presentation of private claims from May 1 to May 14 next. This
                        was agreed to with the qualifying words “sauf exceptions justifiées.”</p>
                    <p>The German minister then proposed that the military commanders here be
                        requested to prepare a joint report on the measures to be adopted for
                        carrying out Articles VIII and IX of the Joint Note. Although nine of the
                        representatives had been instructed by their Governments to favor a
                        conference of the military representatives of only such powers as were
                        prepared to take part with their forces in the measures adopted, the Russian
                        and Austro-Hungarian ministers and myself having stated that our
                        Governments, as signatories of the Joint Note, considered that they had the
                        right to take part in the discussion of these questions, which had all a
                        very important political side, it was therefore decided to invite all the
                        military commanders here to bring about at an early date such a
                        conference.</p>
                    <p>I then read to the conference the report which I had prepared with the
                        Japanese minister as to the reforms to be introduced into the office of
                        foreign affairs and the court ceremonial for the reception of foreign
                        representatives in public audiences. The report was unanimously adopted
                        without any important modifications, except the omission of the words
                        Tsung-li Yamen as the Chinese name of the office of foreign affairs, which
                        all the representatives, except the Japanese minister and myself, wish to
                        have changed.</p>
                    <p>I regret that it was not possible to carry out better the instructions
                        contained in your telegram of December 31 last to Mr. Conger, in which you
                        said— <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p rend="flushleft">if not all on modern lines, it would be highly
                                desirable to have a minister of foreign affairs who shall speak at
                                least one European language. He should be in a position to take his
                                orders from the Emperor.</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>In view of the fact that the ministers who will, under the prince president,
                        be at the head of the office of foreign affairs must be men of very high
                        position in the state, wielding great power and having recognized influence,
                        and that there is no one in China at the present time with such
                        qualifications who speaks any foreign language, it was felt that to insist
                        on your views would result, if adopted, in placing men of no standing or
                        power in positions of great importance and responsibility. None of the men
                        who have been sent abroad by China to hold diplomatic positions—the only
                        ones who know anything at all of foreign languages—have rank, influence, or
                        strength enough to hold the position of minister of foreign affairs and
                        fight with any chance <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0127"/>of success
                        the battle of reform which must shortly begin here and in which they must
                        take a leading part.</p>
                    <p>In view of the above considerations, it was deemed advisable to only
                        recommend that at least one of the two vice-ministers which the powers seek
                        to have appointed shall know some foreign language. Some of China’s
                        diplomatic representatives abroad might fill these positions very
                        advantageously, and later on perhaps become ministers in the office of
                        foreign affairs.</p>

                        conference.</p>
                    <p>After disposing of this work the meeting adjourned.</p>

                        <p>The Government of the United States is of opinion that the amount of the
                            indemnity to be demanded by the powers of China should be as reasonable
                            as possible, and in no ease exceed the power of China to pay. Whatever
                            be the method by which it is computed this indemnity should be demanded
                            of China in one lump sum, without explanation, specifications of reasons
                            for the demand, or indication of the proportion asked by each power.</p>
                        <p>If, however, the claims of the various powers amount to a sum exceeding
                            the power of China to pay, they should be proportionately reduced so
                            that the sum of the demand should not exceed the limit indicated
                            above.</p>
                        <p>If the powers accept this proposition, after payment by China of the sum
                            demanded, an equitable fraction calculated on the losses sustained and
                            the disbursements of each state should be allotted to each one of them,
                            and each power should undertake the indemnification of its
                            nationals.</p>
                        <p>If the powers think that a settlement of the question of the distribution
                            of the indemnity among them on the lines indicated above presents too
                            great difficulties at Peking, the Government of the United States
                            proposes that it shall be submitted to the Arbitral Tribunal of The
                            Hague.</p>
                        <p>In other words, the Government of the United States proposes to the
                            powers to fix among themselves a reasonable sum as a lump indemnity, to
                            demand it without details or explanations of China, and to divide it
                            afterwards among the powers proportionately to their losses and
                            disbursements.</p>

                        <p>Article XII of the joint note provides:</p>
                        <p>“The Chinese Government undertakes to reform the Office of Foreign
                            Affairs and to modify the court ceremonial concerning the reception of
                            the foreign representatives in the sense which the powers shall
                            indicate.”</p>
                        <p>The representatives of the powers have charged the Minister of Japan, the
                            Plenipotentiary of the United States, who with their sanction have added
                            the Counselor of the German legation, to submit a report on the reforms
                            which they consider indispensable to attain the end which the powers had
                            in view in imposing this demand on China.</p>
                        <p rend="center">I.</p>
                        <p>As to the reform of the Office of Foreign Affairs, the commission is of
                            opinion that to put this bureau in a better condition to promptly and
                            regularly transact its business it would be necessary to place in it a
                            small number of personages of high rank <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122"
                                facs="0128"/>and having unquestionable power and influence with the
                            central government. To them should be intrusted by the Emperor the
                            exclusive conduct of direct relations with the foreign representatives.
                            These personages should be directly responsible to the Emperor for their
                            actions and consequently be members of the cabinet of the Emperor
                            (Chun-Chi Chu), or have free access to him as a result of their high
                            rank in the state.</p>
                        <p>The commission consequently recommends that at the head of the Office of
                            Foreign Affairs there should be a Prince (Ch’in Wang), with the title of
                            President of the Office of Foreign Affairs.</p>
                        <p>As it is presumable that the other duties of the Prince President will
                            prevent him devoting all his time to the duties of the Office of Foreign
                            Affairs, the commission is of opinion that under him there should be two
                            ministers (Ta Chen), members of the Chun-Chi Chu, who could take his
                            place in case of absence, and who would have all the necessary authority
                            to transact all current business.</p>
                        <p>These three high officials only would carry on direct relations with the
                            representatives of the powers and receive the foreign ministers for that
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that these three high officials would either singly or
                            collectively receive the representatives of the powers and transact
                            business with them.</p>
                        <p>Although it would be desirable that the above-mentioned personages should
                            have personal knowledge of foreign affairs and of the methods now
                            generally followed by all nations of the world in conducting public
                            business, in provision, however, of their lack of experience, the
                            commission recommends that there should be in the Office of Foreign
                            Affairs two Vice-Ministers, who from their personal experience would be
                            able to place the administration of the office in greater harmony than
                            at present with the methods obtaining abroad. One of them at least
                            should know a foreign language.</p>
                        <p>The commission is of opinion that, with the modifications enumerated
                            above, the transaction of diplomatic affairs with the Office of Foreign
                            Affairs would become easier, more regular, and more rapid.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the modification of Court ceremonial relating to the reception
                            of the foreign representatives the commission has only deemed it its
                            duty to consider the question of public or solemn audiences.</p>
                        <p>The commission is of opinion that the annual audiences given the
                            diplomatic corps by the Emperor should take place in the T’ai-ho Tien,
                            and that those which may be given from time to time to a single
                            representative should be in the Chien-Ching Kung.</p>
                        <p>In every case the Emperor should receive the representatives standing and
                            speak directly to them.</p>
                        <p>On the first audience to present his letter of credence or in the case of
                            the presentation of a letter of the head of his State, an Imperial sedan
                            chair and a guard of honor should be sent by the Emperor to take the
                            representative at his residence and conduct him to the Imperial palace.
                            The representative should be taken back therefrom with the same
                            ceremony. In these audiences the representative should pass, until he
                            has presented his letters, by the central doors; on leaving the audience
                            he should comply with the custom already established in this
                            respect.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor should receive directly in his own hands the letters which
                            the representatives of the powers may have to present to him.</p>
                        <p>As regards the banquets which may be offered by the Emperor to the
                            diplomatic corps, these should be in the Chien-Ching Kung, and the
                            Emperor should assist in person.</p>
                        <p>In going to solemn audiences the representatives of the powers should be
                            carried in their sedan chairs to in front of the hall in which the
                            Emperor is to receive them; they should take their departure in the same
                            way.</p>
                        <p>Such are the principal points on which the commission is of opinion that
                            it would be proper to insist, so that the Court ceremonial relating to
                            the reception of foreign representatives should comply with the
                            established usages between independent and equal nations.</p>
                        <p>The ceremonial details not mentioned here which may develop in the
                            settlement of this question should all be incorporated in the protocol
                            which will be prepared with the Chinese plenipotentiaries.</p>

                            been informed on several occasions, and particularly at the meeting
                            which you had on the 5th of February with the representatives of the
                            powers, that the names of the officials guilty of crimes committed in
                            the provinces would be transmitted to you, together with the punishments
                            which it would be proper to inflict on these officials, in accordance
                            with article 2 of the Joint Note.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned plenipotentiaries have therefore the honor to communicate
                            to you herewith, firstly, a list of the officials whose guiltiness they
                            consider established and for whom they designate the punishments to be
                            inflicted; secondly, a list of the officials who have been reported to
                            them as seriously implicated, but concerning whom they do not possess
                            sufficient information, and on whose cases they ask that the Chinese
                            Government shall make an inquest.</p>

                        <p>The undersigned plenipotentiaries expect that you will request without
                            delay, of the Throne, to terminate finally this affair, decrees in
                            conformity with the demands which they address you. They think that
                            without waiting for results of the inquest, which the Chinese Government
                            should institute as rapidly as possible it would be proper to have
                            posted throughout the Empire, in conformity with the terms of Article X
                            of the Joint Note, edicts stating the punishments which have been
                            inflicted. This will assist in giving more prompt satisfaction to the

                            which has been adjourned until Articles II and X of the above-mentioned
                            note have been complied with.</p>

                        information copy of a memorandum sent by the British minister to his
                        colleagues of the diplomatic corps on the 4th of this month, in which he
                        reviews the present status of the negotiations and the questions which have
                        still to be dealt with.</p>
                    <p>The most important question is naturally the evacuation by the foreign troops
                        of Peking and other sections of this province and the reestablishment of the
                        regular Chinese authority. It has, however, been agreed to by all the powers
                        that the evacuation can not be commenced or any alterations made in the
                        present mode of governing this province until, not only the total amount of
                        the indemnity to be asked of China has been ascertained, but the securities
                        for the payment of the same have been given and accepted by the powers. As
                        on the other side it was agreed to extend the time for the presentation of
                        private claims to the diplomatic corps here to the 14th of May, it seems
                        hardly probable that the total amount of the indemnity to be asked of China
                        can be ascertained even before the 1st of June. In the meanwhile the
                        occupation is costing China enormous sums of money. The estimated war
                        expenditure of the various powers which are known up to the present date are
                        calculated up to the 1st of May. After this date it is probable that unless
                        a considerable reduction in the forces is made that the foreign military
                        occupation will cost China at least $8,000,000 a month. The Chinese, on the
                        other hand, estimate that, together with the loss of revenues, the foreign
                        occupation will cost them close on to $30,000,000 a month, and I am inclined
                        to believe they are not far from the truth.</p>

                        <p>The joint note demanding the punishment of provincial officials
                            implicated in the murder of foreigners in the interior has now been
                            delivered, also a note indicating the towns where all the official
                            examinations have to be suspended for a period of five years.</p>
                        <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0132"/>
                        <p>With the acceptance of the conditions prescribed in these two notes, the
                            execution of Article II of the joint note of December 22 will be on the
                            point of being accomplished.</p>
                        <p>Of the edicts required by Article X, the first and the fourth have
                            already been agreed to, and a commencement of placarding has been made.
                            It remains to placard decrees enumerating the punishment inflicted and
                            the names of the towns where examinations are to be suspended on account
                            of the massacres or cruel treatment of foreigners.</p>
                        <p>With the publication and placarding of the two remaining edicts in terms
                            satisfactory to the representatives of the powers, the execution of
                            Article X will be completed.</p>
                        <p>In a note of the doyen of 26th January, and again in one of 6th of
                            February (see extracts at end), the foreign representatives gave the
                            Chinese plenipotentiaries to understand that on these two articles being
                            carried out they would be ready to discuss the military questions
                            touched on in the Chinese memorandum of January 16, namely, Articles
                            VIII and IX of the joint note, relative to the demolition of the forts
                            at Taku and elsewhere, and the maintenance of the free communication
                            between the sea and the capital, and also the question of the evacuation
                            of the capital and of the province of Chihli.</p>
                        <p>The complete evacuation of the province of Chihli is, of course, not
                            meant, for Article IX of the joint note implies the continued occupation
                            for a time of several points on the line of communication, amongst which
                            Tientsin, Shanhaikwan, Tongku, and probably several others must be
                            included.</p>
                        <p>It seems desirable that the local judicial, civil, and police
                            administration at these points as well as elsewhere should be handed
                            back to the Chinese authorities, notwithstanding the continuance of
                            military occupation, which should be limited to the performance of
                            garrison duties.</p>
                        <p>It may be hoped that before long some plan for carrying out Articles VIII
                            and IX of the joint note may be framed by the military authorities and
                            receive the approval of the powers which have troops in north China.</p>
                        <p>The diplomatic body has appointed a committee to consider and report on
                            the resources which China has at her disposal for meeting the
                            indemnities which she will have to pay in consequence of the troubles of
                            last summer and of the dispatch of military expeditions. This committee
                            has already held several meetings, and will shortly be in a position to
                            present a report containing its recommendations on this head.
                            Consequently the foreign representatives may reasonably expect to be
                            ready to enter upon the discussion of the foregoing subject with the
                            Chinese plenipotentiaries as soon as, if not sooner than, the latter are
                            able to announce that Articles II and X have received complete
                            execution.</p>
                        <p>In approaching the question of indemnities with them, after satisfaction
                            has been obtained on the points dealt with by those two articles, there
                            might perhaps be advantage in intimating to them that if the attitude of
                            China is satisfactory in regard to the initiation of the necessary
                            arrangements, the allied powers will be ready to diminish the numbers of
                            their troops.</p>
                        <p>The first concession which the Chinese Government will be desirous of
                            obtaining is the evacuation of the capital. With regard to Peking, it is
                            to be observed that at present it is divided between the American,
                            British, French, German, Italian, and Japanese forces, and that in each
                            quarter there is a police commissioner invested with extensive powers.
                            Over all there seems to be a general council composed of military
                            officers, but no official information has been received regarding its
                            constitution and functions. Before the city can be handed over to the
                            Chinese authorities it will be necessary to assure ourselves that they
                            are prepared to preserve order and undertake the administration of
                            justice and police. The same remark applies to Paotingfu, Tungchow, and
                            such rural portions of the provinces as are evacuated by the allied
                            troops. It is desirable that the Chinese civil administration at Peking
                            and elsewhere should be restored before the evacuation takes place, so
                            that no opportunity may be afforded for the Chinese authorities to give
                            full proof of their capability to carry on the local governments,
                            failing which the withdrawal of the allied forces would have to be
                            postponed.</p>
                        <p>But previous to answering on this last question it will be necessary to
                            proceed in the following order: <list>
                                <item>Firstly. The representatives of the powers having
                                    expeditionary forces in north China must be agreed among
                                    themselves that the Chinese Government, having executed Articles
                                    II and X of the joint note, and given such other proof of their
                                    intention to perform its remaining stipulations as may be judged
                                    necessary, have thereby become entitled to have the question of
                                    evacuation taken into consideration.</item>
                                <item>Secondly. The assent of the powers concerned must be obtained
                                    to the view arrived at by their representatives.</item>
                                <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0133"/>
                                <item>Thirdly. The powers concerned must give instructions to mand
                                    to concert the necessary measures for carrying out the
                                    evacuation of the cities and districts mentioned.</item>
                                <item>Fourthly. The generals concerned must acquaint the
                                    representatives of their respective Governments with the
                                    conclusions at which they have arrived, including the dates at
                                    which the evacuation will commence and be terminated, and all
                                    other details which it may be necessary to communicate to the
                                    Chinese plenipotentiaries in order to enable them to take over
                                    military charge of the cities and districts as each is
                                    evacuated.</item>
                                <item>Fifthly. This information must be transmitted to the Chinese
                                    authorities, in order that they may be prepared to act on
                                    it.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Each of these successive steps may require from two to three weeks for
                            its completion, owing to the necessity of so many diverse authorities
                            being consulted, both on the spot and abroad.</p>
                        <p>It is obvious that, as the period which must elapse from the commencement
                            of the negotiation in question to the date fixed for the completion of
                            the evacuation can not be estimated at less than three or four months,
                            and may possibly extend to more, a sufficient interval will be left to
                            judge of the degree of good faith with which the Chinese authorities are
                            acting, and to afford an opportunity of putting pressure upon them, if
                            necessary, by temporarily suspending the movements of the troops toward
                            the coast.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to confirm the telegrams
                        received from and sent you on the 8th and 9th instant, respectively.</p>
                    <p>As stated in the latter, your telegrams of January 29, February 19, and March
                        21 seem to conflict. The first named, sent to Mr. Conger, directs that “in
                        case of protracted disagreement over the indemnity you will propose that the
                        matter be submitted to arbitration,” etc.; the second, also to Mr. Conger,
                        “if an agreement for distribution should seem impracticable at Peking
                        without great delay, suggest Hague arbitration,” and the third directs me to
                        endeavor (1) to have the total indemnity kept within the limit of
                        £40,000,000; (2) that it be demanded in a lump sum, proportionate
                        distribution to be settled among the powers, and if such settlement is
                        impossible to suggest Hague arbitration.” Your telegram of the 8th seems to
                        include both the amount and the distribution of the indemnity in the
                        question to be submitted to arbitration in case of disagreement; but to
                        avoid any possible misunderstanding I deemed it prudent to ask for explicit
                        instructions on this point.</p>
                    <p>In a circular memorandum which I sent to the various diplomatic
                        representatives here on the 12th of March, copy of which was inclosed in my
                        No. 52 of March 29 to the Department, I suggested that if it was found
                        impossible to come to an agreement on the question of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >distribution</hi> of the indemnity in Peking the matter should be
                        referred to the Hague Tribunal.</p>
                    <p>I inclose herewith a copy of the declaration which I have to-day transmitted
                        to my colleagues urging upon them the necessity of prompt settlement of the
                        indemnity question on the lines indicated by you. This is, consequently, the
                        third time that the United States representatives have made this proposal to
                        the conference, and I will continue to urge it on every occasion, both in

                            letter of the 23d of March, by which the commission intrusted by the
                            diplomatic corps with ascertaining the conditions under which the
                            payment of indemnities which are to be demanded of China by the powers
                            can be made, was pleased to ask of the representatives of the powers the
                            amount of indemnity which their respective Governments proposed to ask
                            of China, I have the honor, under instructions from my Government, and
                            to complete the indications contained in the memorandum on this subject
                            which I had the honor to send you on the 20th of March, to make the
                            following declaration:</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States desires, as it has repeatedly
                            declared during the course of the present negotiations, to see the
                            powers agree without further delay on a lump sum which they shall demand
                            as an indemnity of China. As it can not be the wish of any one of the
                            powers that this sum of money should exceed the power of China to pay,
                            it thinks that this indemnity should not be superior to £40,000,000
                            sterling.</p>
                        <p>This sum once paid by China should be equitably divided among the powers
                            proportionately to their losses and expenses, and the United States is
                            ready to limit its demand for indemnity to an equitable fraction of this
                            sum acceptable to the other powers.</p>
                        <p>My Government, I take the liberty of adding, is persuaded that the
                            above-indicated solution of the question of indemnity is the only one
                            which offers a prompt settlement, equitable and at the same time of such
                            a nature as to prevent delays and complications equally prejudicial to
                            all interests in the case.</p>
                        <p>I would be greatly obliged to you, Monsieur le Ministre, if you would
                            kindly submit this communication to your colleagues on the commission
                            and to the other representatives of the powers in Peking.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to confirm your telegraphic
                        instructions of the 10th instant.</p>
                    <p>Your instructions on the matter of fixing the amount of the indemnity to be
                        paid by China have had, and will continue to receive, my most earnest
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>As I have already informed you, I have stated to my colleagues that the
                        amount of the losses and disbursements of the United States was $25,000,000,
                        refraining, however, from saying that this was the amount we would demand of
                        China. This I have deemed necessary in view of your oft-repeated
                        instructions to insist, “whatever be the process by which the sum of the
                        indemnity be reached,” on the powers agreeing to a lump sum of not over
                        £40,000,000, to be, after payment by China, divided among them equitably
                        according to the losses and disbursements of each, the United States being
                        willing to accept as its share any just proportion of the said indemnity it
                        might be declared entitled to by the other powers.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>The principal point is to get the total amount to be demanded of China within
                        £40,000,000. Some of the powers appear to have calculated their losses and
                        disbursements in a spirit of great moderation. * * *</p>
                    <p>Another question which disposes me to follow the course I have taken and
                        leave the subject of distribution of the indemnity for later <pb n="129"
                            xml:id="pg_129" facs="0135"/>discussion, is the urgency of getting the
                        powers to demand an indemnity, settle the question of guarantees, begin the
                        evacuation, and reduce the enormous cost to China which the military
                        occupation entails. The military commanders here agree that the evacuation
                        of Peking and Paoting Fu must either be made before June 15 or postponed to
                        next autumn, the climatic conditions in summer not being such as to allow
                        the moving of troops. No time should there fore be lost in forcing the
                        settlement of the indemnity question, to which I am entirely devoting, and
                        shall continue to devote, myself.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to make the following
                            report on my investigation regarding the looting of the foreign
                            settlement at Peitaiho in June last, and all the punishments meted out
                            to those found guilty.</p>
                        <p>It being manifestly impossible to punish all those implicated, I sent for
                            the headmen of all villages within a radius of some 20 li of the
                            settlement. Having interrogated these, I informed them that within
                            fourteen days they must point out to the officials those whom they
                            considered as the most guilty parties and that they would be arrested, I
                            in the meantime holding one-half of the headmen as hostages for the
                            production of the offenders by the other half.</p>
                        <p>In due course 18 men were arrested and their cases investigated by the
                            magistrate of Lin-yu Hsien, acting under my orders. Of these 7 were
                            found to be guiltless, and I accordingly discharged them on the
                            spot.</p>
                        <p>The charges against the remaining 11 may be summed up under the following
                            heads: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>Those who looted, applying the goods to their own use.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>Those who received the looted property.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>Those who looted themselves and incited others to loot, with
                                    the idea of buying from them, and who made a large business out
                                    of it by carrying the goods away and selling them in towns such
                                    as Changli and Funing.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Of the 11, some 6 belonged to the two former classes and the remaining 5
                            to the last.</p>
                        <p>I thereupon instructed the magistrate that all must be punished in
                            conformity with Chinese laws, and he accordingly sentenced the 6 as
                            above to various periods of imprisonment (under Chinese conditions).</p>
                        <p>The latter 5, he said, should be executed. So I told him to proceed in
                            the usual way and apply to the viceroy, Li Hung chang: for the necessary
                            sanction.</p>
                        <p>In consequence, on Friday, 29th of March, I proceeded with the magistrate
                            to see the execution carried out at Pei-tai-ho.</p>
                        <p>Having arrived on the scene, all the headmen petitioned that two of the
                            condemned, <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0136"/>having hitherto led
                            exemplary lives, might be spared. I agreed to this, having consulted the
                            magistrate, and they were accordingly sentenced to imprisonment
                            instead.</p>
                        <p>The sentences on the remaining three were carried out.</p>
                        <p>This disposes of all the cases tried: but still there are two men of
                            wealth who live at Chang Li whom I have been unable to arrest as yet,
                            and I am afraid that it will be impossible to do so, as, being well off,
                            they no doubt are able to bribe freely.</p>
                        <p>These men are perhaps the most guilty of all, and if caught they will be
                            brought to justice: but at present, so it is said, their whereabouts are
                            not known.</p>
                        <p>I trust that the foregoing may be considered sufficient punishment (fines
                            and any effort to recover property were precluded by His British
                            Majesty’s consul, the latter being, or its value, covered by the
                            indemnity), and that the facts maybe made known to all consuls to
                            prevent any further punitive action at Pei-tai ho or the posts of other
                            powers, as I have intimated to the people that the matter may be
                            considered as settled.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant.</p>

                        determining the measures which seem necessary for carrying out the
                        provisions of this article of the Joint Note.</p>
                    <p>I agreed with my colleagues in reporting these measures as necessary, but, as
                        stated to you in my dispatch No. 39 of March 12 last, I doubt whether any
                        serious attempt is made, except, perhaps, by Russia, to carry it into
                        effect.</p>

                        <p>The commission deems it its duty to call the attention of the
                            representatives of the powers to the Wording of Article V of the Joint
                            Note concerning the interdiction of the importation of arms.</p>
                        <p>Said article provides for the maintenance, under conditions to be settled
                            between the powers, of the interdiction of the importation of arms and
                            of material used exclusively in the manufacture of arms and
                            ammunition.”</p>
                        <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0137"/>
                        <p>It is beyond a doubt that, in the opinion of the representatives, it was
                            stipulated to forbid the importation into the Chinese Empire: First, of
                            arms; second, of ammunition for firearms; third, of material used
                            exclusively in the manufacture of arms, and fourth, of material used
                            exclusively in the manufacture of ammunition.</p>
                        <p>So as to prevent the omission in Article V of the words and of
                            ammunition” after those of “interdiction of the importation of arms,”
                            giving rise to misunderstandings, the commission is of opinion that it
                            would be advisable to clearly define in the future correspondence of the
                            representatives of the powers the four classes of objects the
                            importation of which is forbidden by the joint note.</p>
                        <p>As the carrying out of Article V of the joint note depends much more on
                            the powers themselves than on China, the commission deems it absolutely
                            essential that all the powers having treaties with China should reach an
                            agreement between themselves to maintaining in their domains the
                            prohibition of the exportation to China of arms, of ammunition, and of
                            material used exclusively in the manufacture of arms and of
                            ammunition.</p>
                        <p>The commission is of opinion that the enumeration of the objects whose
                            exportation to China should be prohibited can only be made by the
                            authorities competent in the matter.</p>
                        <p>(The list of the objects should be communicated by the Governments to the
                            foreign representatives at Peking so that the latter may take) <hi

                            with carrying them out are given the right of seizure and of

                        <p>The commission thinks it necessary for the countries conterminous with
                            China to adopt on their part the indispensable measures necessary for
                            the interdiction of the importation into China of arms, ammunition,
                            etc., by land routes.</p>
                        <p>The commission is of opinion that a period of at least five years (the
                            diplomatic corps divided on the figure of five years, adhered to only by
                            a majority), should be fixed for the interdiction of the importation of
                            arms, etc., with faculty of extending the term if all the powers agree
                            thereto.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the commission thinks that an Imperial edict should be issued
                            and published in China forbidding the importation of arms, ammunition,
                            etc.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that the diplomatic
                        corps held a meeting to-day to consider the terms of a note to be addressed
                        to the Chinese peace commissioners embodying the views of the powers on the
                        reform of the office of foreign affairs and on court ceremonial. I inclose
                        herewith copies of the notes which we agreed upon in sending.</p>
                    <p>I presented to the diplomatic corps the request of the Chinese
                        plenipotentiaries that the archives of the Tsung-li Yamen should be restored
                        to them, and expressed the hope that my colleagues would agree to do so at
                        once. This proposition met with no objection, but the German minister stated
                        that he would not be able to have the yamen itself turned over to the
                        Chinese, as it is at present occupied by troops of his country.</p>
                    <p>The diplomatic corps also considered a letter from Field Marshal Count von
                        Waldersee, reporting the conclusions reached at a conference of the
                        commanders of the various contingents here concerning the military measures
                        necessary to be taken for carrying out Articles VIII and IX of the Joint
                        Note. I inclose herewith translation of the letter of the field marshal,
                        together with a letter to him from General Chaffee, correcting some errors,
                        and the marshal’s reply thereto.</p>
                    <p>The conclusions of the military commission as to the military works to be
                        razed under the provisions of Article VIII met with the objection of the
                        Japanese minister, who thought that the terms of the article only provided
                        for razing “forts,” whereas the commission has recommended that a number of
                        other works, camps, arsenals, etc., be also destroyed. I agreed with my
                        Japanese colleague, and availed myself of the opportunity to urge your
                        views, that dismantlement of the forts seemed better than the razing of
                        them, in view of the fact that military occupation by foreign forces of this
                        part of China being only temporary, the Chinese, after its cessation, would
                        be deprived of necessary means of defense against an enemy; that as long as
                        the foreign forces were here they could either occupy these positions or see
                        that they were not occupied by the Chinese. Further discussion of the letter
                        of the marshal and the answer to be made by the diplomatic corps was
                        reserved until the meeting to be held to-morrow. A general discussion,
                        however, ensued on the question of evacuation, and on the necessity of
                        promptly taking some steps which would tend to facilitate the transmission
                        of administration from foreign to Chinese hands.</p>
                    <p>All the ministers were in favor of mixed civil government as a first step
                        toward this restoration of Chinese rule, except the German, who stated that
                        his military authorities here were strongly opposed to it, and that they
                        thought Chinese civil authority should only be restored in the various
                        localities after the evacuation by foreign troops. The French minister
                        expressed the opinion that the various generals should be informed at once
                        that partial evacuation might begin without further delay, that the state of
                        the negotiations do not justify the prolongation of the present strong
                        occupation of many localities. This suggestion met with general approval, a
                        qualified one only on the part of the German minister, who stated that he
                        did not think this met with the approval of his military authorities. I
                        availed myself of the opportunity to call the attention of my colleagues to
                        the remark made by the field marshal in his letter of April 6, that if the
                        evacuation <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0139"/>of Paoting Fu and Peking
                        was not made by the 15th of June it could not be carried out until next
                        autumn, and urged that some step be taken to ascertain the ability and
                        willingness of the Chinese to protect the life and property of foreigners,
                        and that not a day should be lost, as the two months which still separate us
                        from the middle of June was a short enough period to determine this fact.
                        The ministers agreed to this, and several of them stated that, had they
                        instructions from their Government concerning the payment of the indemnity,
                        it would be an easy matter to carry out promptly the evacuation, but
                        unfortunately they were still without them.</p>
                    <p>I shall endeavor to-morrow to bring the discussion on your proposition of a
                        lump sum indemnity, which it was impossible to do in the meeting to-day.</p>

                            representatives of the powers have taken, concerning the modifications
                            to be introduced into the court ceremonial, the following resolutions,
                            of which they ask the execution, in conformity with Article XIII of the
                            Joint Note.</p>
                        <p>The solemn audience given by the Emperor to the diplomatic corps shall
                            take place in the T’ai-ho Tien. Those given to one of the
                            representatives of the powers shall take place in the Chien-ching
                            Kung.</p>
                        <p>When a diplomatic agent shall present his letters of credence or a
                            communication from the head of the state by whom he is accredited, the
                            Emperor shall send him an Imperial sedan chair and an escort of honor,
                            which shall take him at his residence and conduct him with his suite to
                            the palace, where he shall be received. He shall be reconducted with the
                            same ceremonial. In going to these audiences the diplomatic agent shall
                            pass through the central doors until he has handed in his letters of
                            credence or his communication. In going away he shall comply with the
                            usage already established.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor shall receive directly into his hands the letters or the
                            communication which the diplomatic agents shall have to give him.</p>
                        <p>In going to solemn audiences the representatives of the powers shall be
                            carried in their chairs to before the hall in which they are to be
                            received by the Emperor. They shall again take their chairs at the spot
                            at which they previously left them.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor shall be present in person at the banquets which he may offer
                            to the diplomatic corps, as he used to do every year before the events
                            of last year, and these banquets shall take place in the Chien-ching
                            Kung.</p>
                        <p>In a general way my colleagues declare that the court ceremonial relating
                            to their receptions should be in harmony with the usages established
                            between independent and equal nations, and they ask that the details
                            concerning the settlement of this question, of which they confine
                            themselves to pointing out the general features, shall be incorporated
                            in a protocol drawn up with them and the plenipotentiaries of the
                            Imperial Government.</p>
                        <p>I beg your highness and your excellency to be so kind as to request of
                            the Throne the necessary measures for carrying out these
                            resolutions.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Highness and Your Excellency</hi>: According to
                            the terms of Article XII of the Joint Note, His Majesty the Emperor of
                            China agreed to “reform the <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0140"
                            />Office of Foreign Affairs in the manner which the powers shall point
                            out to him.” I have the honor to inform you by this dispatch of the
                            resolutions taken by my colleagues on this subject.</p>
                        <p>The fact being admitted that the Tsungli Yamen has during the forty years
                            of its existence clearly shown that it is incapable of discharging the
                            functions with which it was intrusted, the representatives of the powers
                            have deemed it necessary to substitute in its place, for the good of
                            China and for the harmonious relations between the Empire and the
                            foreign governments, an organization analogous to those which exist in
                            other countries.</p>
                        <p>They have thought it essential to give the future Office of Foreign
                            Affairs all the guarantees of ability, of regularity, of promptness and
                            wise administration, failing which the former one has manifested its
                            incapacity, and without which the new one could not fulfill its true
                            object.</p>
                        <p>They have not been less preoccupied with the desire to put in the forward
                            place which belongs to it in the Empire a power whose mission it is to
                            regulate, in the name of the Emperor, the questions which should occupy
                            the first rank in the preoccupations of China.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of the powers think in the first place that the
                            functions previously intrusted to the Tsungli Yamen were divided between
                            a too large number of personages, and that it is proper to substitute in
                            the place of responsibilities too scattered and ill-defined a more real
                            and effective responsibility.</p>
                        <p>They are of the opinion that the Office of Foreign Affairs should have at
                            its head a single minister, with the rank, influence, and power
                            corresponding with the requirements of his situation. This minister, who
                            shall have the title of “President of the Office of Foreign Affairs,”
                            shall be a Prince (<hi rend="italic">Wang</hi>) or ajduke (<hi
                                rend="italic">Kung</hi>), and shall therefore belong to the Imperial
                            family. He shall have two assistants, one of whom shall be chosen from
                            among the members of the Grand Council (<hi rend="italic"
                                >Chün-chi-Chu</hi>), and the other shall have at least the personal
                            rank of President of one of the Ministries or Boards (<hi rend="italic"
                                >Pu</hi>). The three together shall have the exclusive charge of the
                            direct relations with the foreign diplomatic agents. They shall each of
                            them be given the salary and the dignities conformable with the high
                            functions with which they shall be invested and in conformity with the
                            usages obtaining in all civilized countries.</p>
                        <p>They shall receive, either separately or all three together, the
                            diplomatic agents who may have to treat with them in the name of their
                            governments affairs concerning China. When the business is particularly
                            important, and the diplomatic agents express the desire, the President
                            of the Office of Foreign Affairs shall be personally present, either
                            alone or with his assistants, at the interviews which may foe asked of
                            him. It is only on account of the probable multiplicity of his
                            occupation and because his other obligations as a member of the Imperial
                            family may prevent him from devoting all his time to the ministry that
                            two collaborators are given him. But in reality it is he who in the
                            management of affairs has the proper duties and responsibility; it is
                            only his name and his address which figure on the official
                            correspondence from the diplomatic agents, and his two colleagues who
                            have rank and title less than he, have principally for duty to transact
                            current affairs, though having, nevertheless, authority to take up the
                            others.</p>
                        <p>The name of “Tsungli Yamen,” which recalls such unfortunate remembrances
                            and which does not indicate sufficiently the importance and authority of
                            the power to which belongs, under the responsibility and the orders of
                            the sovereign, the highest functions of the State, is done away with. It
                            shall be replaced, in virtue of an Imperial decree, by that of “Wai-wu
                            Pu,” and in the official order of precedence the Wai-wu Pu shall pass
                            before the six Boards or Ministries.</p>
                        <p>It is desirable that the three members of the Wai-wu Pu shall have as
                            extended a knowledge as possible of international questions and of the
                            methods generally followed in their settlement in civilized countries.
                            So as to have from this latter point of view an additional guaranty, it
                            will be necessary that under the orders of the three members of the
                            Wai-wu Pu there shall be appointed, with the title of “Chief of Bureau,”
                            two officials, able by their experience and ability to place the
                            department to which they are attached in more real harmony than was the
                            Tsung-li Yamen with similar organizations existing in foreign countries.
                            It would be equally desirable that one of these high officials should
                            know a European language.</p>
                        <p>Such are the conditions laid down by the representatives of the powers
                            for the reform of the Office of Foreign Affairs of the Empire, and I
                            have the honor to request of your highness and your excellency to please
                            request of His Majesty the Emperor of China the necessary orders to have
                            the same carried into effect.</p>

                        <p>All the forts at Shanhaikwan threaten the railway and roadstead and
                            should be razed. As, however, they are suitable for the accommodation of
                            the international garrison to be left at Shanhaikwan, they should be
                            retained for the present.</p>
                        <p>The west arsenal at Tientsin, which is of no military importance, should
                            not be razed, and the high mud wall, which lies in the Russian cession,
                            should be placed at the disposal of the Russian authorities.</p>
                        <p>Article IX: All the officers commanding contingents were unanimous in
                            recognizing the necessity of maintaining permanently a strong garrison
                            at Tientsin and Shanhaikwan-Chin-wang-tao, the garrison at Tientsin
                            being fixed at 2,000 men of all arms, and that of
                            Shanhaikwan-Chin-wang-tao at 1,500 men. Germany, France, Great Britain,
                            Italy, and Japan will find their share of the garrison of Tientsin and
                            Russia and the above-mentioned powers, less Italy, of that of
                            Shanhaikwan.</p>
                        <p>Austria-Hungary will only leave small guards in Shanhaikwan and
                            Tientsin.</p>
                        <p>My further proposal to arrange for permanent garrisons at various points
                            along the railway—Peking, Taku, Shanhaikwan—to secure free communication
                            between the capital and the sea, met with full approval. Only the
                            American general, Chaffee, was of the opinion that an occupation of
                            Peking, Tientsin, and Shanhaikwan would be sufficient.</p>
                        <p>It was decided to occupy Hwang-tsun, Lang-fang, Yang tsun,
                            Chun-liang-cheng, Tongku, Lutai, Tongshan, and Changli each with 300
                            men, including 50 mounted men, a few machine guns being left at
                            each.</p>
                        <p>The distribution of these garrisons at the various contingents was
                            arranged after consultation as follows: Italy occupies Hwang-tsun;
                            Germany, Lang-fang and Yang-tsun; France, Chun-liang-cheng and Tongku;
                            Great Britain, Lutai and Tongshan; Japan, Lanchou and Changli.</p>
                        <p>It is to be remarked that the Russian general de Wogack, expressed the
                            view that the occupation of some of the above-mentioned points might be
                            dispensed with.</p>
                        <p>The quartering of the troops in the various garrisons is to be undertaken
                            by the contingent concerned. Each garrison will be responsible for the
                            safety of the railway line to half way to the next garrison on each side
                            of it. As long as the railway remains under military control the railway
                            stations will remain occupied by British police guards. Every power has
                            the right of leaving small lines of communication detachments at
                            important points, such as Tongku.</p>
                        <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0142"/>
                        <p>Between the present occupation and the permanent settlement there will be
                            a transition period in which special measures must be taken. It was
                            uniformly recognized as necessary that for this period the garrison of
                            Tientsin should be raised to 6,000 men. The surplus of 4,000 men above
                            the numbers of the permanent garrison will be found by France, Great
                            Britain, Japan, Italy, and Germany. During this period also the
                            provisional government of Tientsin will continue in the exercise of its
                            functions. The lines of communication stations on the Pei-ho, Hoshi-wu,
                            Matou, and Tungchou must remain occupied. The time for the withdrawal of
                            this reenforcement must be reserved for ulterior consideration by the
                            governments, as must also the fixing of the date on which it will be
                            possible to limit the permanent measures of security which have been
                            considered above. It will only be possible later on to judge when this
                            latter measure can be taken, and it depends upon the question’ of
                            whether the Chinese Government is strong enough and shows an honest
                            desire to take over itself the protection of the life and property of
                            foreigners.</p>
                        <p>The creation of a common commander in chief, both during the transition
                            period and for the permanent occupation, is considered by all commanders
                            of contingents as urgently desirable from a military point of view. It
                            was also considered as desirable that a change should be made in the
                            chief command about once a year, so that all the contingents should take
                            their turn in furnishing the commander in chief.</p>
                        <p>After the consideration of the executive measures to be taken in the
                            carrying out of Articles VIII and IX was concluded, the manner in which
                            the evacuation of the province of Chihli was to be conducted, as being
                            closely connected with the above measures, was debated upon.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that it would be impossible to assemble large bodies of
                            troops at Tientsin, as this, especially in summer, would entail grave
                            danger from a sanitary point of view. It therefore follows that,
                            simultaneously with the evacuation of Peking and Paoting Fu, the
                            transport of the troops to their own countries must begin, and that
                            therefore the evacuation can not begin until the necessary transport
                            ships are ready and on the spot. It was further recognized that in the
                            months of July and August the marching of large bodies of troops in the
                            direction of Tientsin-Tongku would be impossible. The consequence of
                            this is that the evacuation of Peking and Paoting Fu must be completed
                            by the 15th of June, unless the occupation is to be extended till
                            autumn.</p>
                        <p>The handing over of the civil government to the Chinese authorities can
                            only take place after the evacuation of the towns in question; but it is
                            proper and necessary that Chinese troops should be allowed previously to
                            approach so that guard and police duties might be handed over to them
                            direct. Thus the outbreak of troubles and risings of the people in the
                            larger centers will be effectively prevented.</p>
                        <p>At the close of the conference an understanding was come to as to the
                            strength of the legation guard, which will not exceed a total of 2,000
                            men. There will be left in Peking: <table rows="9" cols="2">

                            acknowledge receipt of a copy of your letter, dated April 8, to his
                            excellency M. de Cologan, dean of the diplomatic corps, setting forth
                            the recommendations of the conference of the commanders in chief of the
                            different contingents regarding the execution of Articles VIII and IX of
                            the Joint Note submitted by the diplomatic corps to the Chinese
                            representatives. It is observed that your excellency states that “By
                            unanimous decision of the commanders of the contingents, my proposition
                            was accepted, to wit: To raze the following fortifications, which, on
                            account of their location and nature, might hinder the free
                            communication between Pekin and the sea.”</p>
                        <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0143"/>
                        <p>It is noticed that your letter does not state that dismantlement of the
                            fortifications would be a satisfactory compliance with Article VIII to
                            the United States, as was stated by me to your excellency and others
                            present. This matter is material only in conserving on this occasion
                            record of my statement at the conference, as dismantlement of the forts
                            referred to was the position held by the United States through its
                            minister when the joint note was under discussion by the diplomatic
                            corps; so I have been informed.</p>
                        <p>It is also noted that your excellency states regarding the points to be
                            occupied that “Only the American general, Chaffee, was of the opinion
                            that occupation of Peking, Tientsin, and Shanhaikwan would be
                            sufficient.” My proposition, as stated at the conference, was that
                            Peking, Yangtsun, Tientsin, Tonku, Tongshan, and Shanhaikwan should be
                            occupied.</p>
                        <p>With assurances of my high esteem, I remain your excellency’s obedient
                            servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: Referring to my communications
                            of the 6th instant, Nos. 1390, 1891, I have the honor to inclose you a
                            copy of a letter from Gen. Sir Alfred Gaselee (British), General Chaffee
                            (American), and Colonel Garioni (Italian).</p>
                        <p>In regard to the contents I have to say— <list>
                                <item>First. I concur entirely in the opinion of Gen. Sir Alfred
                                    Gaselee. I only said in my communication that the designation of
                                    a common commander was urgently desirable from a military point
                                    of view, but as this, like the other points under discussion,
                                    will of course be decided by the allied powers, I have not given
                                    it special attention.</item>
                                <item>Second. Article VIII of the joint note provides that the Taku
                                    forts and other remaining fortifications, which can hinder free
                                    communication between the capital and the sea, are to be razed.
                                    At the conference the commanders of the contingents therefore
                                    only discussed the razing of those fortifications which are
                                    referred to in this provision. The statement of General Chaffee
                                    that a dismantlement of the forts would be sufficient escaped me
                                    as well as his remark that he considered the continued
                                    occupation of Yungtsun, Tongku, and Tangshan to be
                                    necessary.</item>
                                <item>Third. The right declared by Colonel Garioni in his letter to
                                    continue to take part in the occupation of the Shanhaikwan forts
                                    as at present is also, in my opinion, in no way modified by his
                                    declaration not to take” part in the continued occupation of
                                    Shanhaikwan-Chinwangtao.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Besides it is guaranteed by the provision that every power has the right
                            to have depots at important points on the lines of communication.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The diplomatic corps continued to-day the
                        discussion of the letter of Field Marshal Count von Waldersee, begun in its
                        meeting of yesterday, as reported to you in my dispatch No. 69. The
                        conclusions reached in the marshal’s letter concerning the carrying out of
                        Article VIII were accepted by the ministers, who will recommend their
                        adoption to their respective governments. I again objected to the razing of
                        the forts and to the inclusion of works other than forts in the number to be
                        destroyed, as did also the Japanese minister. As, <pb n="138"
                            xml:id="pg_138" facs="0144"/>however, the Japanese minister finally
                        withdrew his objections, I did not think proper to insist. So I stated that
                        I accepted the views of the majority, though with the greatest reluctance.
                        The field marshal in his letter expresses the belief that until the end of
                        the occupation the provisional government should continue in the exercise of
                        its functions. I expressed the opinion that it would be better if this
                        Provisional Government should cease to exist as soon as conditions justified
                        handing over the city of Tientsin to the Chinese authorities. The French,
                        British, and Russian ministers agreed with this proposal, and the diplomatic
                        corps finally expressed the wish that “the Provisional Government shall hand
                        over to the Chinese authorities the powers which belonged to them in normal
                        times as soon as the situation will permit it and without prejudice to the
                        military occupation.” The German minister declined to express an opinion on
                        this subject. All the others favored it.</p>
                    <p>The discussion again coming up on the question of beginning the evacuation, I
                        recalled to the meeting the French minister’s proposal that the time had
                        come when the generals might be informed that the commencement of evacuation
                        seemed necessary. He repeated his former remarks, and added that he thought
                        the military commanders might be informed that the withdrawal of the
                        expeditionary corps could begin. This would in no way affect the maintenance
                        of the forces of occupation. The Japanese minister stated that he would like
                        to see the evacuation of Peking and Paoting Fu effected as soon as possible;
                        that he deemed the presence of troops at Tientsin sufficient pressure to
                        secure prompt compliance by the Chinese Government with the demands of the
                        powers concerning indemnity. I stated that I believed it was not necessary
                        to begin a discussion of the question with the Chinese; that we could
                        confine ourselves to beginning a reduction of the forces, which could be
                        steadily carried on, if conditions admitted of it, or stopped if they did
                        not, but that in view of the marshal’s statement that Peking and Paoting Fu
                        must be evacuated prior to the 15th of June or only next autumn, I thought
                        that everything should be done to hasten it, as the military occupation was
                        costing enormous sums to China and the country was also suffering indirectly
                        by it large loss of revenue. The British minister agreed in a general way
                        with our views concerning the desirability of at once beginning a reduction
                        of the military forces, while the German minister refused to discuss the
                        question of evacuation, unless considered jointly with that of the payment
                        of the indemnity.</p>
                    <p>On the proposition of Sir Ernest Satow, the following statement was agreed
                        upon to be telegraphed by the ministers to their respective governments, and
                        if approved by them to be communicated to the various military commanders:
                        “A partial reduction of the troops is already possible, but the evacuation,
                        properly so called, cannot commence before the Chinese Government has
                        fulfilled the conditions of Articles II and X of the Joint Note, and has
                        accepted the general principles which will be laid down for the payment of
                        the indemnities. That is to say, the sum total and the mode of payment.”</p>
                    <p>The paragraph of the marshal’s letter 5, concerning the handing over of the
                        civil government to the Chinese authorities occasioned some discussion. The
                        opinion of all the ministers was that the civil administration should be
                        transferred to the Chinese not after the evacuation, but some time before;
                        not less, certainly, than three weeks or a month. Here again the German
                        minister declined to express an opinion contrary to that of the field
                        marshal.</p>
                    <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0145"/>
                    <p>The force indicated for legation guards seems now to the ministers here to be
                        a very large one. The French, Russian, Austrian ministers and myself,
                        expressed the belief that it was probable that the Chinese Government would
                        not return to Peking with a force of 2,000 foreign troops in the capital.
                        While the diplomatic corps will not recommend any reduction of this force at
                        the present time, it is highly probable that it will be very considerably
                        reduced as soon as may be. There is a strong desire among many of my
                        colleagues to prevent any one nation having a larger guard than another. The
                        German minister thought that if one of the powers should withdraw its guard
                        another should have the right of bringing the total of the Peking garrison
                        to the regular number. This opinion found no support in the meeting.</p>
                    <p>The draft of a letter to the Chinese plenipotentiaries was then read, in
                        reference to the international settlement on the island of Ku-lang su
                        (Amoy), asking them to take steps at an early date to have created the
                        international settlement there which the powers understood the Chinese
                        authorities were willing to make. I will send you a copy of this
                        communication within a few days.</p>
                    <p>The British minister then presented some remarks of his Government on the
                        report for the assessment of claims adopted by the diplomatic corps. The
                        British Government states that it will not ask indemnities for legation
                        guards, and then enumerates a number of claims which the diplomatic corps
                        had agreed to allow, but which it thinks are of a very doubtful nature, but
                        in case the powers do not agree to this it suggests they should be most
                        carefully scrutinized before presentation. Sir Ernest also stated that 5 per
                        cent should be the limit of interest asked in all cases. The British
                        minister also resubmitted a proposition of his Government, which meets with
                        the support of the German and Italian ministers, that all private claims
                        should be examined by a committee of the diplomatic corps so as to ascertain
                        whether they have all been passed upon in uniform way and in strict
                        conformity with the rules adopted. I abstained from voting on any of these
                        propositions, not being in a position to consider any suggestions concerning
                        claims until the general proposal of my Government on the presentation of a
                        lump sum indemnity has been voted on.</p>
                    <p>The diplomatic corps then adjourned without fixing a day for its next
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>I have the honor to be, etc.,</p>

                        of the 18th instant.</p>
                    <p>In view of the fact that the amount of the indemnity to be paid by China is
                        under constant discussion by the foreign represenatives here, and that they
                        have apparently decided not to wait for China to suggest acceptable
                        financial measures for its payment, as provided by Article VI, paragraph
                            (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), of the Joint Note, but to inform her of the
                        measures they consider best, I am most desirous of knowing your views on the
                        subject.</p>
                    <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0146"/>
                    <p>The Chinese naturally desire a joint guarantee of any loan or bonds they may
                        have to issue, as it would save them a very large sum, and some of the
                        powers, Russia, I believe, included, would like to see a joint guarantee of
                        all the powers given.</p>
                    <p>Sir Robert Hart told me recently that the London bankers advise Mm that on
                        the securities mentioned by him in his memorandum (see my dispatch No. 50,
                        of March 28) a loan of from £30,000,000 to £40,000,000 could be placed. He
                        thinks it quite impossible to float it at over 80, possibly much less, in
                        view of the present stringency of the money market.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monsieur le Maréchal</hi>: I hastened to communicate
                            to my colleagues your letter of 6th of April, concerning the resolutions
                            taken by the commanders of the allied forces for carrying out Articles
                            VIII and IX of the Joint Note.</p>
                        <p>As regards the questions of a military nature treated of in your letter,
                            the representatives of the powers have adopted, subject to the approval
                            of their governments, the propositions which you have made known to
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Thus they have adopted the opinions expressed by the commanders of the
                            allied forces concerning the enumeration of fortifications to be razed,
                            the designation of points to be occupied between Peking and the sea, the
                            distribution of nationalities in the posts which are to be established,
                            and the total figure of the forces which shall occupy the different
                            posts. They have noted, however, that the distribution of the total of
                            the effective forces between the various nationalities has not been
                            indicated for Tientsin and Shanhaikwan.</p>
                        <p>As regards the questions which are at the same time of a military and
                            political nature, the representatives of the powers express the
                            following opinions:</p>
                        <p>Concerning the garrison of 4,000 men which is to remain, provisionally,
                            at Tientsin during the period which will follow the present occupation,
                            the commanders of the allied troops should indicate, by nationality, the
                            proportion of this garrison, so that this proportion can be submitted to
                            the various governments.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the Provisional Government of Tientsin, it should transmit its
                            powers to the native authorities as soon as the situation will permit of
                            so doing and without this measure having any reference to that of
                            military occupation.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the unity of the chief command, the majority of the ministers
                            have pronounced themselves in favor of the suggestion made by the
                            commanders of the allied troops. It is understood, nevertheless, that
                            the legation guards at Peking should be in the future and until ordered
                            to the contrary, outside of the troops placed under the supreme
                            commander.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the question of military evacuation, a proposition in the
                            following words has been submitted unanimously by the representatives of
                            the powers to <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0147"/>their
                            governments: “A partial reduction of troops is already possible, but the
                            evacuation, properly so called, can only commence when the Chinese
                            Government has fulfilled the conditions of Articles II and X of the
                            Joint Note, and when it has accepted the general principles which shall
                            be indicated to it for the payment of the indemnity. That is to say, the
                            sum total and the mode of payment.”</p>
                        <p>Concerning the conditions of the transfer of the local administration to
                            the native authorities, the commanders of the allied troops should study
                            if, one month before the evacuation, the police and administration of
                            Peking can not be intrusted to the civil Chinese authorities, under the
                            superintendence of the foreign military troops. It is to be noted, in
                            this connection, that there has never been in the city of Peking a
                            military administration nor a permanent military garrison. The banner
                            troops can not be considered as such.</p>
                        <p>The other questions treated of in the letter of your excellency have been
                            examined and noted with all the care and attention which they deserve.
                            The representatives of the powers will not fail to give them such
                            consideration as may be necessary, and to inform, in proper time, the
                            commanders of the allied troops through your excellency.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The diplomatic corps held a meeting to-day, at
                        my request, to consider the proposition of the United States concerning the
                        indemnity to be asked of China, which I had made known to it in my memoranda
                        of March 29 and April 11, copies of which I had the honor to transmit to you
                        in my dispatches Nos. 52 and 59.</p>
                    <p>I outlined the considerations which I thought imposed the solution of this
                        question, as suggested by you, as the only just, reasonable, and politic one
                        which could be found. The powers had declared that the disorders in June of
                        last year could not serve as a pretext for the acquirement of territory or
                        any other special ad vantages, consequently the indemnity could only be paid
                        in money. The terms of the Joint Note of December 24 last stated that the
                        indemnity should be “equitable,” in other words just and reasonable, by
                        which we understood that it should not exceed the power of China to pay
                        without creating for it grave financial embarrassments, prejudicial to the
                        administration of the country, administrative reform, and to all foreign
                        interests, and which might compel it to have recourse to financial
                        expedients, which all the powers must condemn, imperiling the independence
                        and integrity of the Empire.</p>
                    <p>Since the indemnity to be asked of China must therefore be reasonable, it
                        mattered little to us whether its annual revenue were eighty or a hundred or
                        more millions of taels. We were bound to only ask that which China was in a
                        position to pay us of our losses and expenses, and it was not for us to seek
                        to ascertain what was the full extent of China’s resources so as to exact
                        the last cent of it of her. The Government of the United States thought that
                        the limit of China’s ability to pay, under the conditions specified, was
                        £40,000,000 sterling.</p>
                    <p>The payment of this sum would cost China over £50,000,000, but it was our
                        belief that she could pay it; but any additional demand would expose foreign
                        interests to the gravest danger. I referred to our declared policy here, by
                        which we sought, among other things, to prevent the recurrence of
                        antiforeign troubles, and said that we must therefore try to prevent as much
                        as possible the imposition of new taxes upon the Chinese people for the
                        payment of indemnities, for <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0148"/>by so
                        doing their hostility would be intensified and perpetuated, and that we
                        should ultimately lose much more than the few millions which we now sought
                        to secure.</p>
                    <p>The Russian minister stated that he had communicated your proposal to his
                        Government, but had received no reply. In principle his Government was
                        willing to accept what China was able to pay. That so far as that went he
                        accepted our proposition, and thought that undoubtedly the resources of
                        China should be taken into consideration in assessing the amount of the
                        indemnity. As to the figure fixed by you, £40,000,000, he thought it was
                        premature to discuss it until the commission charged by the diplomatic body
                        to study the resources of China had made its report on the subject. He
                        inquired how this limit had been reached by my Government. I replied that
                        the data on which all estimates of the revenue of China were based were well
                        known to everybody; they were practically the pamphlets on the subject by
                        Mr. Jamieson, to which might be added the memoranda recently submitted by
                        Sir Robert Hart; that no accurate data beyond these were accessible to
                        anyone, unless I was very much mistaken on the subject. These data clearly
                        indicated that the borrowing capacity of China barely reached £40,000,000
                        sterling with her present available revenues. This statement of mine was,
                        however, controverted by the French minister, who said that he thought China
                        could pay much more and still retain sufficient revenue for the
                        administration of the country. He deferred expressing his opinion on our
                        proposition until the long-promised report of the commission above referred
                        to is submitted.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese minister, while thinking that any discussion of our proposal and
                        the fixing of any limit to the sum to be demanded was premature, believed
                        that the powers might have to consider a reduction of the indemnity; that
                        while common principles had been accepted by most of the powers for
                        assessing private claims, no such principles, so far as he knew, had been
                        applied to assessing war expenses. He thought it might be necessary that
                        something be done in this direction.</p>
                    <p>The British minister, though not ready to state the limit of the indemnity to
                        be fixed, said that in the belief of his Government this sum should not
                        exceed a reasonable amount, payment of which would not create financial
                        embarrassment to China.</p>
                    <p>The German minister stated that he had no instructions from his Government on
                        our proposition, but he thought that if the commission charged with studying
                        the revenue ascertained that China could pay the full amount of the expenses
                        of the powers she should be made to do so, and that he saw no reason why the
                        latter should show excessive generosity in the matter.</p>
                    <p>The Belgian minister thought that if a reduction in the indemnity should be
                        decided upon, it should only bear on the governmental claims; that the
                        private claims should not suffer thereby.</p>
                    <p>On the whole, I gained the opinion that the representatives realized that the
                        total amount of the claims may ultimately have to be subjected to a certain
                        scaling down, although most of them hold that the limit fixed by you is
                        entirely too low.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the disinclination to discuss the subject before the submission of
                        the report of the commission on finance, and in view of several of my
                        colleagues being still without any instructions from their governments on
                        the subject, I did not press the matter to-day, but informed them that I
                        reserved it for discussion later on.</p>
                    <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0149"/>
                    <p>The Italian minister then informed the diplomatic corps that the war claim of
                        his Government, up to the 1st of May, is 70,000,000 francs; for each month
                        after this date it will be 2,500,000 francs. If the claim is not paid by the
                        1st of July, it will ask 200,000 francs per month as interest. If the
                        occupation lasts until the autumn, a special item of 4,000,000 francs will
                        be asked. His Government also claims 2,000,000 francs for the destruction of
                        its legation here and the property therein. The private claims to be
                        presented by him amount to 5,635,844 taels. This sum is subject to
                        reduction.</p>
                    <p>The Russian minister informed his colleagues that the state expenses of
                        Russia, known up to the present time, including the destruction of its
                        railroad, amount to 170,000,000 rubles; that the military expenses per
                        month, after the 15th of March, were 2,000,000 rubles. As to private claims
                        he was unable to fix their amount, but it would be between 6,000,000 and
                        8,000,000 rubles, in all probability.</p>
                    <p>In a previous meeting I asked the diplomatic corps to agree to restore to the
                        Chinese the Tsungli Yamen, when it was agreed that the archives should be
                        turned over to them, but the building, being in the occupation of the German
                        military forces, could not at present be restored to them.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese plenipotentiaries having asked me to renew their request that the
                        buildings as well as the archives be restored to them, I did so to-day, and
                        meeting with the support of my colleagues, the German minister agreed to ask
                        his military authorities to comply with this request, which I think will be
                        done within a few days.</p>
                    <p>After discussion on a number of other subjects of minor importance, among
                        others a reply to Count Waldersee’s letter of April 6, the diplomatic corps
                        adjourned without indicating the date of its next meeting.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The British minister called on me this morning
                        and informed me that he was in receipt of instructions from his Government
                        giving its views on the subject of the indemnity. He said that it thought
                        the indemnity should be scaled down to £50,000,000, and that a date should
                        be fixed after which no claims could be made, this to limit the amount of
                        the claims for military occupation, which will be about a million and a half
                        sterling a month. His Government would propose that China negotiate a loan
                        in the open market for a sum sufficient to pay the powers £25,000,000, for
                        which purpose it could give the native customs revenues and the still
                        unalienated foreign customs revenues. As to the time and mode of payment of
                        the remaining £25,000,000, the powers would have to make an agreement with
                        China. Five years might prove to be all the time necessary, for the
                        increased tariff which it is proposed to grant her, and other sources of
                        revenue may be sufficient to enable her to discharge this debt.</p>
                    <p>The minister was of opinion that the French might be induced to a scaling
                        down, and, from what I wrote you in my No. 74, of the 23d instant, I think
                        it probable some of the powers will view favorably some reduction of their
                        claims. Sir Ernest feared, however, that this <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144"
                            facs="0150"/>plan would be extremely difficult to get Germany to consent
                        to, and lie thought that Italy and Austria might also hold out against it.
                        Belgium, I may add, undoubtedly would; but if Russia and France would accept
                        this proposition, I think it might be carried through.</p>
                    <p>The minister asked me if I thought the United States would favor such a
                        compromise. I told him I could hold out no hope of it; that in case our
                        proposal was finally declined by the powers, I was instructed to press for a
                        reference of the whole subject to The Hague tribunal.</p>
                    <p>The British minister feared that such reference, if agreed to, would greatly
                        delay any settlement. It would be impossible to get the evacuation of this
                        province carried out in the meanwhile, and our endeavors to keep down the
                        indemnity might therefore possibly result in saddling on China a large
                        increase of the amount now claimed. He thought his Government wanted to fix
                        the date after which no claim for military occupation could be made at
                        September next at the latest.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The diplomatic corps held a meeting to-day for
                        the purpose of hearing the report of the committee appointed to study the
                        question of the payment of the indemnities to be asked of China. I inclose
                        herewith copy of said report.</p>
                    <p>After the reading of the report, which, as you will notice, contains no
                        recommendations as to the method to be suggested to China for paying the
                        indemnities, the Russian minister submitted a short memorandum, with the
                        object of proving the necessity of a joint guaranty by the powers of the
                        loan which it is supposed China will be obliged to negotiate.</p>
                    <p>Assuming that the amount of the indemnities which will be asked of China is
                        £65,000,000, and the correctness of the statement contained on page 23 of
                        the report of the commission, that it would cost China 23 per cent in
                        commissions, etc., to float a loan, and that she would furthermore have to
                        pay 7 per, cent interest on it, Mr. de Giers shows that she would have to
                        borrow £84,500,000 to secure £65,000,000. At the rate of 7 per cent, China
                        would have to pay on this £5,915,000, or 34,447,500 Haikwan taels. Should a
                        joint guaranty be given, China would not have to pay over 7 per cent in
                        commissions; consequently a loan of £70,000,000 would net her £65,100,000.
                        With this guaranty the annual interest, Mr. de Giers said, would not
                        probably be more than 4 to 4½ per cent, which, at 4 per cent, would be
                        £2,800,000 per year interest, or 18,200,000 taels. The saving, therefore, on
                        a loan of this magnitude which a guaranty would insure would be 16,247,500
                        taels a year on interest alone.</p>
                    <p>Mr. de Giers then made the same calculation on the American proposition,
                        payment of a lump sum of £40,000,000 sterling. This, he said, would entail a
                        reduction on the present figures of the indemnities asked by the various
                        powers of 38.46 per cent, Without guaranty, a loan of £40,000,000 would cost
                        China £51,935,000; at 7 per cent interest this would make £3,630,450, or
                        23,597,925 taels. In other words, more than the loan of £70,000,000 with
                        guaranty.</p>
                    <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0151"/>
                    <p>A loan for the same amount of £40,000,000, at 7 per cent commission, with a
                        joint guaranty would only cost China £43,000,000; and with 4 per cent annual
                        interest, £1,720,000 a year, or 11,180,000 taels.</p>
                    <p>The saving to China on the loan of £40,000,000 which a guaranty would insure
                        would be 12,417,925 taels annually.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the question of resources, Mr. de Giers stated that he suggested,
                        as a means of raising the 18,200,000 taels necessary to insure the payment
                        of a guaranteed loan of £70,000,000 at 4 per cent, that the following

                    <p>Mr. de Giers’s figures are, like all those given in the report of the
                        commission, subject to considerable correction. Their importance, however,
                        is not great in the present case, and I only give them as showing the
                        disposition of the Russian Government to favor a joint guaranty, and not to
                        attempt anything in the way of reforming the interior administration of
                        China. Russia and some of the other powers can favor with perfect equanimity
                        the raising of tariff on imports and exports, as they have small commercial
                        interests in China.</p>
                    <p>The British minister informed me that he is in favor of using to secure the
                        loan, the foreign customs, the native customs to be put under the control of
                        the Maritime Customs, the raising of the tariff to an effective 5 percent,
                        and the salt tax, which the Chinese Government has expressed itself willing
                        to have applied to this purpose. This latter, it is thought, would bring in
                        a sum of 11,000,000 taels a year.</p>
                    <p>The important feature of the report of the commission and of the suggestions
                        made by the Russian minister and those offered by others of my colleagues is
                        that without the raising of the tariff to 10 per cent, and a joint guaranty
                        given by the powers of the loan China will have to make, it is absolutely
                        impossible for China to pay £65,000,000. The figure of the indemnity you
                        suggested indicates the limit of her ability to pay.</p>
                    <p>To all inquiries of me whether the United States would join in a guaranty I
                        have in the most categorical and emphatic way said “No.” I furthermore
                        refused to consider, or even submit to you, the raising of the tariff to 10
                        per cent unless equivalent compensation be given our trade immediately, or
                        at least the negotiations pushed on concurrently with those for the
                        settlement of the indemnity. To raising the tariff to a 5 per cent effective
                        I think there can be no objection. It is simply equity to China, but even
                        this should be compensated for in some way. This is more easy for China to
                        do, since a compliance on the part of China with several of the demands our
                        commercial world has been urging on it for years past will not entail any
                        loss of revenue to it.</p>
                    <p>I have got my colleagues to agree that the first step be taken now is to
                        inform the Chinese plenipotentiaries that the losses and disbursements of
                        the various powers approximate £67,000,000 sterling, and to ask them what
                        measures they propose taking for the payment of it.</p>

                            earnest possible moment and the consideration to be observed toward
                            China, considered as a solvent creditor who has always been scrupulous
                            in her engagements up to the present, but is temporarily
                            embarrassed.</p>
                        <p>Among the Chinese revenues it has principally considered those which
                            combine the following conditions: Well organized collection, assured
                            yield, easy and efficacious control. It, however, advises, even though
                            they fulfill these conditions, to exclude those taxes whose income is
                            especially applied to expenses which apparently could not be modified
                            without prejudice to the internal administration of the Government.</p>
                        <p>Above all, it was necessary to know the approximate amount of the claims
                            of the powers. The information which was obtained from the different
                            legations, and which in some cases is as vet only known provisionally or
                            semiofficially, seems to bring this figure to about
                            £65,000,000–1,629,000,000 francs, 1,300,000,000 marks, $399,000,000
                            gold, 415,000,000 Haikwan taels (in calculating a Haikwan tael at 3.90
                            francs).</p>
                        <p>This total will, moreover, probably he exceeded, since it is only
                            calculated approximately up to July 1 and since it must increase with
                            the protracted military occupation.</p>
                        <p>The commission next consulted the persons who appeared most capable, from
                            their situation, experience, and special authority, to furnish the
                            commission information on the resources of the Empire and the best mode
                            of payment. It successively interviewed Sir Robert Hart, general
                            inspector of customs; Mr. Hillier, director of the Hongkong and Shanghai
                            Bank; Mr. Pokotilow, Russo-Chinese: Mr. Rump, director of the Deutsche
                            asiastische Bank; the Mandarins Hsu Shou-peng, late Chinese minister to
                            Korea; Na Tong, vice president of the treasury department, and Chou Fu,
                            grand treasurer of Chih-li.</p>
                        <p>The commission examined a work by Mr. Augustin, director of the
                            Indo-China Bank. The German, English, and Japanese ministers submitted
                            reports.</p>
                        <p>From all these opinions and information some general observations are
                            brought out which are important to be noted to serve as guide for the
                            detailed explanations which are to follow.</p>
                        <p>There is little doubt but what China will find it difficult to clear in
                            one payment, through its native resources, the sum which the powers,
                            according to the first information we possess, are disposed to claim
                            from her. There are not sufficient available funds in the country.</p>
                        <p>The commission was unanimous in considering the balance of the maritime
                            customs and the likins actually under foreign control, the increase of
                            the customs tariff to 5 per cent effective ad valorem, the yield of the
                            native customs, and the taxation of certain merchandise, at present
                            imported free, as revenues offering I good security from the triple
                            point of view of income, collection, and control, and which could be
                            applied to the service of the indemnities without exercising any
                            injurious effect on the internal organization of the Empire.</p>
                        <p>Objection was raised to certain other resources, such as increasing the
                            customs duties to 10 per cent, the salt duty, the rice tribute, the
                            Manchurian income, and the revenue resulting from economies in various
                            expenses.</p>
                        <p>A third category, the land tax and the likin, was withdrawn as not
                            satisfying the sought-for conditions.</p>
                        <p>Finally a fourth one was pointed out as offering the Chinese Government
                            the means to cover the deficit in its budget, caused by applying the
                            receipts to the payment of the indemnities—dwelling tax, stamp tax,
                            increased duties on native opium.</p>
                        <p>These general observations made, we will resume what has been said
                            relative to the mode of payment and resources.</p>
                        <p>1. Mode of payment: If China is relieved from the direct payment in a
                            lump sum, four systems can be chosen from— <list>

                            credit of the Empire being such that it would be difficult to borrow a
                            lump sum of £65,000,000 at reasonable rates.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Loan to meet the lump sum of
                                the indemnities, guaranteed by all the powers</hi>.—Such a loan
                            could undoubtedly be easily floated without too great expense and at a
                            low rate of interest. Its realization would allow the immediate payment
                            of the indemnities and the speedy restoration of China to its normal
                            state.</p>
                        <p>This system would be advantageous for the indemnified parties (companies
                            and individuals), China, and the commerce of the extreme East. As to the
                            States, they would be jointly responsible for the new debt contracted by
                            the Empire. Financially they would not be gainers, for they would have
                            to borrow to pay themselves; rather they would lose, each one having to
                            assume, besides the commission previously deducted by the bank, the
                            joint responsibility of the total loan.</p>
                        <p>It has been urged, it is true, that this solidarity is not indispensable
                            to the guaranty of a loan, the credit of certain States being sufficient
                            security; that, on the contrary, it would excite fear among the
                            financiers in case political complications should arise among the joint
                            guarantors. Finally, the powers would not perhaps care to guarantee a
                            loan in a lump sum without reserving control of the revenues to be
                            applied to the payment of the installments, and this might create a very
                            delicate and complicated situation in carrying it into effect.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Chinese bond</hi>.—Each
                            power would receive from China bonds for the amount of its total
                            indemnity. These bonds, falling due at stated intervals, would bear
                            interest, and each power could use them as security for a national loan
                            which each would have to raise. The lump sum of £65,000,000 would then
                            be distributed among the powers under various forms of loans and under
                            conditions in harmony with the credit of each instead of floating one
                            international loan. Each State would be at liberty to only raise the
                            amount of the indemnity due its countrymen, provided it were willing to
                            accept its payment in installments and to choose at its convenience the
                            date of issue.</p>

                            would have the disadvantage of extending the settlement of the expenses
                            already paid by the powers over a number of years and of leaving the
                            door open to political contingencies.</p>
                        <p>Such is the resume of the opinions and information furnished the
                            commission on this point. The commission does not feel it can recommend
                            one system rather than another. It believes that in the actual state of
                            affairs the question can not he decided except by the powers themselves,
                            between whom there exist differences, and who independently of the
                            agreement to be made, would undoubtedly have to consult the financial
                            establishments whose cooperation would be indispensable.</p>

                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Maritime customs.</hi>—The
                            surest Chinese revenue is constituted by the Maritime Customs under the
                            control of a foreign administration. The events of 1900 have proved
                            their strength, since, excepting 1899, the receipts for last year equal
                            those of 1898. Consequently they can be considered as a minimum which
                            will be exceeded as soon as trade resumes its regular development,
                            reaching 23,000,000 or even 24,000,000 Haikwan taels.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Likins, actually under
                                foreign control.</hi>—These resources are composed of (1) the
                            general likins of the ports of Soochou and Kiukiang, of the
                            Shanghai-Sunkiang, and the eastern district of Chekiang; (2) the likin
                            on salt from the port of Ichang, from Hupeh and Anhui.</p>
                        <p>This revenue seemed safe enough to be accepted as security for the
                            Anglo-German loan of 1898. The customs administration, which
                            investigated it thoroughly, values it at 5,000,000 taels at the
                            lowest.</p>
                        <p>Wisely administered, these two revenues form a total of from 28 to 29
                            million taels, from which amount an average of 24,000,000 taels is to be
                            deducted until 1905 for the service of the present foreign debt. From
                            the available balance, according to Mr. Komura, there would be paid
                            besides the administration expenses of the Maritime Customs, including—

                            charged by the Chinese Government to other revenues, which would raise
                            the disposable balance to 1,522,000 or to 2,522,000 Haikwan taels.</p>
                        <p>(2) That as the annuities of the actual debt will reach their maximum in
                            1905, decreasing from then on, the disposable balance will increase
                            200,000 taels per year from this date until 1918, at which time it will
                            reach more than 5,000,000 taels.</p>

                            commerce in compensation of the increased taxes imposed.</p>
                        <p>The duties collected for the year 1899 equal 3.18 per cent (3.43 per cent
                            for the year 1900) of the value of all the merchandise imported. The
                            increase of 5 per cent will lead approximately to an increase in receips
                            of 3,900,311 (figure for 1899), not including opium, which will not be
                            taxed with a new duty, and rice, which will continue to enter free.</p>
                        <p>It is to be remarked that the year 1899 was exceptional, and if one takes
                            for basis of calculation the average of three normal years (1896 to
                            1898, for example) the increase will not be found to exceed 2,320,276
                            taels, or 2,500,000 taels at the maximum.</p>
                        <p>Commerce seems to make no objection to this measure, but demands in
                            compensation: (1) Specific and not ad valorem duties: (2) a more
                            equitable tariff-evaluation; (3) reform of the Chinese administration of
                            the likin, assuring a more honest administration in the transit of
                            merchandise, and putting an end to the obstacles created by the
                            dishonesty of the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>In view of the increased customs duties to 5 per cent ad valorem, Sir
                            Robert Hart indicated a way which presents the advantage of requiring
                            neither revision nor negotiation of tariffs, at the same time restoring
                            the duties to their primitive value. At the time of the establishment of
                            the tariff 3 Haikwan taels were worth £1; to-day it takes about 7 to
                            make £1.</p>
                        <p>It would only be necessary to give the Haikwan tael a fixed conventional
                            value equal to its value in the beginning to tax merchandise with 5 per
                            cent effective ad valorem.</p>
                        <p>According to the customs inspector, the corresponding increased receipts
                            would be from 10 to 15 million taels.</p>
                        <p>It has, however, been remarked that this proceeding would create
                            inequalities in practice, and it would be difficult to make the
                            Governments accept it, and Sir Robert Hart’s estimates appear
                            optimistic. According to the average of the years 1896–1898, the
                            increase would only be 9,153,833 taels.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Native customs.</hi>—In the
                            ports open to foreign commerce the maritime customs exercises its
                            authority only over vessels of foreign construction whether they be
                            owned by Chinese or foreigners.</p>
                        <p>The duties on merchandise transported by junks are collected by a special
                            native administration, and according to a special tariff which is
                            effective in the open ports side by side with the maritime customs, and,
                            moreover, everywhere else on the coast or in the islands at the stations
                            which the Chinese Government has established from time immemorial.</p>
                        <p>The opinions obtained are unanimously in favor of the control of this
                            revenue and of its application to the service of indemnities. Sir Robert
                            Hart estimates that the high personnel of the maritime customs could
                            easily, in the open ports, undertake the service which is exercised by
                            the native customs administration of “Chang Shui.”</p>
                        <p>Sir Ernest Satow valued this revenue at 1,000,000 taels for the present
                            and at 4,000,000 for the future. Messrs. Komura and Hillier, at
                            5,000,000—at 3,000,000 now and at 5,000,000 to 10,000,000 for the
                            future. Mr. Pokotilow estimates the duties collected in the open ports
                            alone at 5,000,000, At the rate of 2½ per cent, Mr. Rump calculates that
                            at Tientsin alone the duty on the junks would amount to 300,000
                            taels.</p>
                        <p>In regard to these native customs, Mr. Hillier claims that their yield
                            has always been considered by the Chinese Government casual rather than
                            a certain income, for scarcely 20 per cent is turned into the treasury,
                            which consequently would not feel the loss to any great extent.</p>

                        <p>It must be recalled that the disposable funds will increase from 1905
                            about 200,000 taels per year, and that in 1918 they will reach more than

                        <p>We will now examine the second category of resources.</p>

                                to 10 per cent.</hi>—This measure has in its favor, as has already
                            been stated, its easy application and the certainty of its yield.
                            According to Mr. de Mumm, foreign commerce with China would see no great
                            inconvenience in this, experience having shown that the increase in the
                            entrance duties is divided about equally between the producer, the
                            dealer, and the consumer, and that, maintained within reasonable bounds,
                            it does not encroach upon the consuming power of a country. Japan, where
                            the duties have lately been raised from 10 to 20 per cent over their
                            preceding figure, is the most recent proof of this fact. Mr. de Mumm
                            calculates that this increase in duties would produce an increase of
                            17,475,000 taels.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rump estimates that the tax of 10 per cent could be adopted under the
                            condition of a tariff revision. Certain products, such as needles,
                            aniline dyes, etc., could easily bear increased duties. Others, such as
                            cotton goods, could not. A choice would have to be made. Mr. Komura
                            proposes a 10 per cent increase of the import duties for all
                            merchandise, including foreign opium and articles introduced in
                            franchise under the actual régime.</p>
                        <p>The increase in the receipts would be, according to him, about 18,037,374
                            taels. Taking for base the imports of 1899, however, he expresses the
                            opinion that this change in the tariffs would call for compensations. He
                            then proposes as a correlative condition of the increase in duties an
                            absolute exemption of likin duties, terminal or other taxes collected in
                            the interior in favor of the imports and exports. Considering the
                            enormous importance of the total commerce of the Empire, he believes
                            that the imports and exports enter for only a small part in the income
                            from the likin and that its loss would not greatly affect the provincial
                            budgets.</p>
                        <p>The transit duty should, at the same time, be abolished. Mr. Komura
                            advises the institution of a commission charged with revising the
                            tariffs on the new bases adopted and indicating the measures to be taken
                            to put an end to the extortion affecting the import and export articles
                            in the interior of China.</p>
                        <p>The new tariff could be applied without it being necessary to wait until
                            the commission has concluded its labors. The taxes would be collected
                            temporarily according to the ad valorem tariff.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pokotilow does not believe there are any fundamental objections on
                            the part of commerce to the elevation of the entrance duties from 5 to
                            10 per cent, providing that a serious revision of the tariffs is made,
                            rendering them as equitable as possible, If the revision is well made,
                            the movement of exchanges will not diminish. The revision could be made
                            in a relatively short time, in a few weeks at the most.</p>
                        <p>Sir Ernest Satow shows that his Government could not accept the increase
                            in the rate of the entrance duties to 10 percent. He declares that
                            English trade is already protesting against this measure, unless it be
                            compensated by modifications in the commercial regime of China. He
                            upholds the 10 per cent duty as well as the 5 per cent, exclusive of
                            opium and rice.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese delegates, on the contrary, would view the increase to 10 per
                            cent with great satisfaction. Resuming, the yield from it would be
                            valued at 10,648,736 taels at the minimum, exclusive of opium and rice,
                            and at 18,037,374 taels at the maximum, including these products.</p>

                            or likin imposed en route or on arrival at the last station. No
                            distinction has been made between the two duties in the propositions

                            department’s figures, the salt duty in 1899 yielded a little less than
                            14,000,000 taels, but according to certain information this figure would
                            reach 15,000,000, and even 20,000,000 under a good administration.</p>
                        <p>Sir Robert Hart suggests, as a means of control, the extension of the
                            actual control of the likins intrusted to the Maritime Customs
                            administration. It is to be remarked in this connection that the
                            administration only controls the likin on salt and not the consumption
                            duty.</p>
                        <p>Sir Ernest Satow, who is also in favor of applying the revenue from the
                            salt tax to the payment of the indemnities, values this resource at
                            12,000.000 or 13,500,000 taels, which, according to the most
                            conservative opinions, could be increased 50 per cent, or 6,000,000
                            taels, and even 100 per cent, or 12,000,000 taels, under an honest
                            administration. Mr. Hillier, who agrees with Sir Ernest Satow, says that
                            the salt revenue under the present administration is valued at
                            13,800,000 taels, but that under foreign control this figure would be
                            considerably increased.</p>
                        <p>From his estimates he deducts 1,800,000 taels already applied to the
                            foreign debt, which brings it to 12,000,000 taels.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pokotilow advises the assuming of the salt duty only as a last
                            resort, and then only in case that the increase in the customs duties to
                            5 per cent, the native customs, and certain economies to be imposed upon
                            the Chinese Government in various expenses do not furnish sufficient
                            resources. According to Mr. Pokotilow, this control would necessitate
                            the creation and administration of a very complicated and delicate
                            organization and a foreign personnel, which is completely lacking. He
                            considers this control as an interference in the internal
                            administration, and as such discourages it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rump believes that the duty on salt could be placed under foreign
                            control. At Tongku alone, where it reaches 6,000,000 piculs per year, an
                            income of 1,600,000 taels would thus be obtained. He does not conceal
                            the fact that the control in the interior provinces might be difficult.
                            He does not consider it would be possible to import salt free of duty,
                            using the amount of the duties collected for the service of the debt. As
                            long as the monopoly exists and corporations hold the traffic in their
                            hands they will be strong enough to oppose the sale of foreign salt. The
                            Chinese delegates declared that the disposable yield from the salt
                            duties was 10,000,000 taels, from which 6,000,000 must be deducted for
                            governmental expenses, leaving a balance of about only 4,000,000.
                            According to them, a reform in this tax would be difficult to
                            establish.</p>
                        <p>From these various opinions the yield from the salt tax can be valued at
                            between 4,000,000 and 20,000,000 taels.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">h</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Peking octroi.</hi>—Sir
                            Robert Hart mentioned this revenue accessorily, estimating it at 500,000
                            taels. Mr. Pokotilow confirmed this valuation, adding that the duties
                            collected were quite heavy.</p>
                        <p>He advised, in a general way, to avoid everything that might lead to
                            interference in the internal administration of the country. Mr. Rump
                            declared that they could not count upon such duties, and that they would
                            have to be left to the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>According to the Chinese delegates, this tax would only yield 170,000
                            taels, which would be absorbed by the Peking administration.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">i</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Rice tribute.</hi>—The rice
                            tribute is furnished by the two provinces of Kiang-su and Chekiang. The
                            quantity of rice sent to Peking varies from 12,000,000 to 14,000,000 tan
                            or piculs, or 104,500 tons. About 200,000 piculs are sent by the old
                            route of the Grand Canal, the remainder by the vessels of the China
                            merchants.</p>
                        <p>The administration of this transportation is in reality one of the
                            principal Chinese departments, and employs a regular army of officials
                            and clerks. The method of collection is as follows: The land taxes,
                            which are in principal collected in kind, are, in fact, paid in money,
                            or rather in copper cash. The tariff conversion is fixed from time to
                            time, according to the commercial value of rice, and increased by a
                            supplementary tax, destined to cover the transportation costs and
                            various expenses.</p>
                        <p>It appears to be sometimes double and sometimes treble the price of rice.
                            With <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0157"/>the money thus obtained
                            the tax collectors buy rice on the markets and send it to the depots
                            awaiting its shipment to the north.</p>
                        <p>When the transportation administration has received the rice, it is
                            responsible for it until it reaches the Tung-chou storehouses, where it
                            is to be left.</p>
                        <p>Sir Ernest Satow, who suggested this revenue, furnished the following
                            observations on this subject. The quantity of rice shipped in this
                            manner would, according to Mr. Jamieson, reach 1,200,000 piculs. The
                            duties and transportation permit cost a very large sum in the
                            provinces—1,500,000 taels.</p>
                        <p>From another source the rice tribute would amount to 800,000 piculs,
                            worth 4 taels the picul.</p>
                        <p>Forty per cent of this rice is transported by the Grand Canal, and the
                            expenses are so exorbitant that the picul delivered in Peking costs
                            about 15 taels; 60 per cent is loaded on the boats of the China
                            merchants at the rate of 1½ tael per picul. If the entire amount were
                            transported by sea the saving resulting from this would amount to 9½
                            taels on 40 per cent of the 800,000 piculs, or 3,040,000 taels. Finally,
                            a third estimate fixes the quantity of rice transported by steamers at
                            300,000 piculs, and places the picul at 6 taels delivered at Peking;
                            400,000 piculs would be transported by the Grand Canal, and would cost
                            15 taels. The saving resulting from the transportation by sea of the
                            total tribute would amount to 3,600,000 taels. The sums used in the
                            purchase of rice reach, according to Mr. Jamieson, from 3,360,000 to
                            3,920,000 taels.</p>
                        <p>The rice is eventually distributed to the bannermen, who resell it to the
                            poorest classes in Peking for 1½ taels.</p>
                        <p>On the money used for the purchase of rice and the cost of transportation
                            there might be realized, according to Mr. Jamieson, 6,562,000 taels;
                            according to another, 7,440,000, and according to a third person,
                            7,800,000 taels.</p>
                        <p>Sir Robert Hart, without furnishing further information, values the yield
                            from the suppression of the rice tax at 2,000,000 or 3,000,000
                            taels.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pokotilow favors a reform in the transportation of the rice tribute
                            and of the application of the savings thus realized to the service of
                            the indemnities, but he does not consider the eventuality of the
                            suppression of these distributions of rice to the bannermen, which are
                            governed by the constitution of the Empire. He estimates the savings
                            resulting from the use of the maritime route in preference to the Grand
                            Canal at 1,000,000 taels.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rump also believes that the Chinese Government would gain by
                            transporting all the rice from the tribute by sea, because, besides the
                            saving in freight, it would thus put an end to the frauds committed by
                            the boatmen, who take advantage of the special passes of the rice
                            tribute to smuggle merchandise and thus escape the customs.</p>
                        <p>This measure would only meet opposition on the part of the boatmen. But
                            Mr. Rump does not think that the resources thus realized could be used
                            to guarantee a loan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hillier proposes also to apply to the payment of the indemnities the
                            land tax of Kiang-su and Chekiang. This tax is estimated by the Chinese
                            at from 10,000,000 to 12,000,000 taels in the present state, but Mr.
                            Hillier only estimates it at 8,000,000, remarking, however, that it
                            would certainly give much more under foreign control.</p>
                        <p>The information furnished on this revenue by the Chinese delegates was
                            somewhat vague. According to them the rice tribute to-day represents
                            1,240,000 bags. It was formerly 1,400,000 bags. The price of this rice
                            in the south would be 4,000,000 taels; the transportation would cost 6
                            taels per bag by the maritime route; 130,000 bags would pass by the
                            Grand Canal, but they were not able to say what the expenses would
                            amount to. The delegates agreed that the freight of the maritime
                            transportation could be diminished if it were awarded by competition,
                            and the savings resulting from this could be applied to the service of
                            the indemnities. They also recognized the possibility of collecting the
                            rice tribute in money and distributing to the Tartars the value of the
                            rice which is given them, thus leaving the cost of transportation to be
                            used for other purposes.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">j</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Manchu pensions.</hi>—Sir
                            Ernest Satow suggests the following scheme:</p>
                        <p>Capitalize the pensions granted to the Manchu soldiers and issue bonds
                            bearing 55 per cent interest. The official figures for Peking alone are
                            5,760,000 taels, without taking into consideration the Manchu garrisons
                            of the provinces, which appear to be of no military use.</p>
                        <p>If the bonds issued to the holders of these pensions represent one-half
                            the value of the capitalized sum this plan would result in a saving of
                            2,830,000 taels.</p>
                        <p>Sir Robert Hart estimates the sum which could be raised from the
                            suppression of the Manchu pensions at 3,000,000 taels.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pokotilow advises against interference with the revenues applied to
                            this expense as too closely affecting the internal organization.</p>
                        <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0158"/>
                        <p>Mr. Rump believes that these pensions could only be suppressed upon
                            condition of sending the Tartars back to Manchuria and supplying them
                            with the means of existence, the best plan being to give them lands.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese delegates do not conceal the fact that the Government would
                            be obliged to reduce these pensions, but that it would have to use the
                            sums thus economized for other pressing needs. Mr. de Mumm is of the
                            opinion that the savings to be realized from the rice tribute and the
                            Manchu pensions are resources which could only be utilized to replace,
                            in favor of the Chinese Government, the revenues appropriated elsewhere
                            to the payment of indemnities. He does not think it can be used as
                            security for a loan, in view of the fact that it would be too difficult
                            to collect it.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Mr. Pokotilow pointed out as resources the amount of the savings
                            which China could realize from the military expenses and from the cost
                            of the transportation to Peking of the money coming from this tax.</p>

                        <p>The third category of resources is the one which was withdrawn as not
                            satisfying the conditions to be realized.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">l</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Land tax.</hi>—Although this
                            tax is the principal basis of the State revenue, it is sometimes
                            abandoned by the Government when the crops are destroyed or threatened
                            by public calamities. As this tax lacks stability Sir Robert Hart does
                            not advise its appropriation. Mr. Pokotilow thinks that this tax is the
                            last one to be resorted to, as it will be very difficult to administer.
                            The Chinese delegates called attention to the law prohibiting the
                            increase of the land tax.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">m</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Likin.</hi>—The likin is a
                            temporary tax, the suppression of which would be viewed with favor by
                            the Chinese people and foreign commerce; consequently Sir Robert Hart
                            thinks it preferable not to encourage its maintenance.</p>
                        <p>Finally a fourth category was pointed out as offering the Chinese
                            Government the means for covering the deficiencies in its budget caused
                            by the withdrawal of the receipts to be applied to the indemnities.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">n</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Tax on dwellings</hi>.—The
                            establishment of this tax, according to Sir Robert Hart, would give
                            20,000,000 taels per year by only imposing an average contribution of
                            0.05 taels on each inhabitant.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese delegates, appearing to confound this tax with the poll tax,
                            declared the collection would arouse great difficulties among the
                            people. A hundred years ago the Government attempted to impose a poll
                            tax, but was obliged to give up the idea.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">o</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Stamp tax.</hi>—The
                            establishment of this tax would always furnish a considerable
                            revenue—5,000,000 taels per year—according to Sir Robert Hart. Mr.
                            Pokotilow sees in this a source of great corruption, and does not think
                            that it could be levied outside of the open ports.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese delegates do not believe it possible to establish this duty
                            except in the open ports.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">p</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Native opium</hi>.—Sir
                            Robert Hart estimates the quantity of native opium produced and placed
                            in circulation at 150,000 piculs per year—at least three times the
                            quantity of foreign opium. In fixing the duties at 60 taels per picul
                            and in modifying the regulations 10,000,000 taels per year would be
                            obtained.</p>
                        <p>According to Mr. Pokotilow it would be easier to administer the tax on
                            opium than on salt. This duty is not high in theory, but it is
                            enormously increased by the extortions of the mandarins.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese officials are not of this opinion. They estimate, on the
                            contrary, that it is very difficult to reach native opium, which, being
                            produced everywhere, escapes all surveillance.</p>
                        <p>Regarding these three taxes, Sir Robert Hart observes that they would be
                            badly received, owing to their innovation under foreign pressure, and
                            could even arouse hostile feeling among the population.</p>
                        <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0159"/>
                        <p>Mr. Pokotilow considers these receipts as very uncertain, and he thinks
                            that at the most they could only be suggested to China as a means to
                            furnish new resources in exchange for those that will be taken from
                            her.</p>
                        <p>One of the financiers consulted pointed out that the foreign capitalists,
                            from whom the money which China needs would have to be borrowed, would
                            prefer one single revenue of known yield, and would probably not accept
                            as security a number of small revenues offering a certain guaranty, but
                            coming from various sources. According to his idea, it would be better
                            to appropriate one revenue already known and endeavor to increase its
                            income.</p>
                        <p>If foreign finance views it in this light, the first category and
                            resources, <hi rend="italic">f</hi>, increase of customs to 10 per cent,
                            and salt tax, would fulfill these conditions, and for this latter even
                            it would be necessary to clearly state that it is a question only of the
                            likin on salt actually under foreign control. All these resources could
                            be managed by the maritime-customs administration. If the enormous
                            deviation which separates the minimum and maximum valuations is noted,
                            one is lead to ask if it would not be possible to find in these
                            resources alone the sums necessary for the service either of one single
                            loan or of individual loans.</p>
                        <p>According to an opinion given to the commission, the brokerage,
                            commission, issue, and other expenses for a Chinese loan would amount to
                            about 23 per cent of the nominal loan, but in the case of a loan
                            guaranteed by all the powers, or of individual loans contracted by each,
                            these expenses would be considerably decreased. To count these expenses
                            at 5 per cent would be to estimate them at a very high sum, and very
                            probably above the real value.</p>
                        <p>The amount of the indemnities being provisionally fixed at £65,000,000,
                            the Chinese loan at 5 per cent would amount to £85,000,000, while the
                            loan guaranteed at 4½ per cent by all the powers would at the maximum
                            amount to £70,000,000. It is even permitted to hope that it can be
                            contracted at 4 per cent. The money lenders would perhaps consent to
                            defer the liquidation of their capital until the foreign control over
                            the new revenues had increased their yield, and until the extinction of
                            the old debt would have increased the disposable funds mentioned in
                            paragraphs A and B. If this could be done, then China would only have to
                            provide for the present for the payment of the interest at 4 or 4 per
                            cent on £70,000,000, or £3,150,000, or £2,800,000, or 20,200,000 taels,
                            or 18,180,000, at 3.90 francs.</p>
                        <p>In paying the expenses of the Peking College and the Chinese legations
                            abroad from the general revenues of the Chinese Government we can
                            dispose of at least 1,522,000 taels oh the customs and likins under
                            foreign control; the increase of the tariff to 5 per cent would yield a
                            mininum of 2,500,000 taels; the native customs 3,000,000 taels; total,
                            7,022,000 taels. There then remain to be found 11,158,000 or 13,178,000
                            taels, according to whether the loan is contracted at 4 or 4| per cent.
                            But these estimates are based on the minimum calculations, and should
                            these figures be exceeded in practice, as seems probable, the disposable
                            amount, estimated by the commission at 7,022,000 taels, would easily
                            reach 9,000,000. To find the 18,000,000 or 20,000,000 necessary the
                            following methods remain:</p>
                        <p>Increase the customs tariff duties to 10 per cent if all the powers
                            consent, which would give a minimum excess of 8,000,000 taels, and
                            extend the measure taken for the 1898 loan; that is to say, place some
                            new likin districts under the control of the maritime customs. Profiting
                            by the experiments already made, 18,000,000 or 20,000,000 taels could
                            thus easily be obtained.</p>
                        <p>Another system would consist of adding the salt duty to the 9,000,000
                            taels, which the commission believes it can count upon at the present
                            moment.</p>
                        <p>The liquidation at one-half per cent per year, necessitating 2,300,000
                            taels, would begin as soon as the disposable funds would permit of so
                            doing, which doubtless would not be long delayed.</p>
                        <p>Before concluding, the commission feels it should mention Mr. Rockhill’s
                            proposition to make China pay a lump sum of £40,000,000, which the
                            interested powers would divide equitably among themselves in the ratio
                            of their expenses and losses. If the commission has not expressed itself
                            regarding this proposition it is because it was not discussed, as the
                            diplomatic corps to which it was proposed, decided not to examine it
                            until after learning the results of the investigation recorded in this
                            report.</p>

                            necessary orders can be issued by the German military authorities, who
                            have charge of the Tsungli Yamen buildings.</p>

                        <p>We have had the honor to receive your excellency’s communication of the
                            16th instant, wherein you say that the foreign representatives, on your
                            submitting to them our request that the archives of the Tsungli Yamen be
                            handed over to us, have complied with this request, etc.</p>
                        <p>In reply, we have to express to your excellency our sincere thanks for
                            the kindness you have shown in bringing this matter to the attention of
                            the foreign representatives. But the archives of the Tsungli Yamen are
                            very numerous, and the important documents should be selected, examined,
                            and looked over, and even then it can not be avoided omitting some of
                            them: To remove all the archives from the yamen and store them would be
                            very inconvenient.</p>
                        <p>We have the honor, therefore, to request your excellency to do your best
                            and bring this matter before your colleagues in a friendly way, asking
                            their consent to the Tsungli Yamen buildings and the archives being
                            handed over to us at an early date. This will enable us to forthwith
                            examine and look over the archives and thus avoid the public business
                            being interferred with. If the foreign representatives give their
                            consent, after receiving your excellency’s reply we will address their
                            excellencies, begging them to fix a time for handing over to us the
                            yamen and the archives. This we earnestly pray for.</p>

                            to us the archives of the Tsungli Yamen and the buildings, some time ago
                            we requested your excellency to submit the question to the foreign
                            representatives, which is a matter of record.</p>
                        <p>On the 27th of April we had the honor to receive from the German
                            minister, Dr. von Mumm, a note in which he stated that he had fixed the
                            1st of May as the <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0161"/>time for
                            handing over to us the yamen and archives. We therefore deputed officers
                            to act with those appointed by the foreign representatives. The archives
                            were duly checked and handed over to us, together with the buildings,
                            excepting the printing office and machinery of the Tung-wen Kuan, which
                            the German Government retains temporarily for its use.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The diplomatic corps held a meeting to-day for
                        discussion of the report submitted to it in its last meeting on the mode of
                        payment of the indemnities to be asked of China.</p>
                    <p>Before beginning the discussion of this question the Belgian minister stated
                        that as a result of instructions recently received from his Government the
                        total of the claim which Belgium had to present would be 32,358,750 francs,
                        subject to some slight reduction.</p>
                    <p>The French minister then stated that the official figures for his claims,
                        calculated to the 1st of July, would be 286,500,000 francs, which might
                        possibly be subject to a reduction of 6,000,000 francs. His Government would
                        ask, for military expenses after the 1st of July, between six and seven
                        millions of francs per month.</p>
                    <p>The British minister announced that, following the example of the other
                        governments, Great Britain would add its naval expenses, and that instead of
                        the £4,800,000 previously given as its expenditures for military purposes in
                        connection with the expedition to north China, it would now ask £6,500,000.
                        All these figures bring up the grand total of the claims, calculated up to
                        the 1st of July, to about £62,500,000 sterling, or 450,000,000 taels.</p>
                    <p>The Russian and the French ministers then stated that it was of the utmost
                        importance to ascertain at once whether the governments would agree to a
                        joint guaranty of the loan, which seemed to be the only way for China to pay
                        off her indebtedness. They said they had formal instructions to urge such a
                        guaranty. The Japanese minister said that his Government believed that a
                        loan should be made by China, and he gave it as his personal opinion that
                        Japan would join in guaranteeing it.</p>
                    <p>The Austrian minister expressed himself as favorable to a guaranty, while the
                        Belgian, German, British, Italian, and Dutch ministers said they were
                        without instructions. I confined myself to saying that the Government of the
                        United States saw the greatest difficulties in the way of agreeing to such a
                        proposition, and in private conversation with my colleagues I have
                        repeatedly stated that it seemed to me highly improbable that we could
                        possibly entertain it.</p>
                    <p>The British and German ministers and myself having expressed the opinion that
                        it seemed incumbent upon us, in view of the terms of the Joint Note, that
                        China should be given an opportunity to state what amount of indemnity she
                        could pay, and how she proposed doing it, the ministers, after some
                        discussion, agreed to submit to the Chinese plenipotentiaries a statement,
                        and of which the following is a translation: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The total amount of the disbursements of the powers, as well for
                                military expenses as for the losses of societies and foreign
                                individuals and of Chinese who have suffered <pb n="156"
                                    xml:id="pg_156" facs="0162"/>in their person and property
                                through their being in the employ of foreigners, down to the 1st of
                                July, amounts approximately to 450,000,000 taels, a figure which
                                will be considerably increased if the occupation is to be prolonged
                                beyond that date.</p>
                            <p>In conformity with article 6 of the Joint Note accepted by His
                                Majesty the Emperor of China, and according to which China will take
                                financial measures acceptable to the powers, so as to guarantee the
                                payment of the said indemnities, the foreign representatives ask the
                                Chinese plenipotentiaries for a formal assurance that they recognize
                                their liability for this sum, and they beg them to indicate the
                                financial measures which China expects to take to discharge herself
                                of this debt.</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>I agreed to the terms of the above note on the express and formal
                        understanding that it should in no wise be construed as making a claim of
                        China for the amount indicated in it or as requiring of China any promise to
                        pay, but that it was simply sent the plenipotentiaries so as to enable them
                        to give formal expression as to the limit of China’s ability to pay and the
                        means she proposed taking.</p>
                    <p>The Russian and British ministers accepted my reservations, in which they
                        entirely concurred, as did tacitly the rest of the diplomatic body.</p>
                    <p>I inclose a copy of a memorandum by the Russian minister advocating the joint
                        guarantee of the loan, abstract of which I sent you in my dispatch, No. 79,
                        of May 1, 1901.</p>
                    <p>An examination of the report of the committee on the payment of indemnities,
                        and the other documents I have sent you, as well as the remarks of my
                        colleagues in the meeting of to-day show that the only possible chance of
                        China being able to pay the enormous amount which the various claims now
                        reach would be by means of a joint guarantee by the powers. Without said
                        guarantee it seems even improbable that China would be able to pay the forty
                        millions of pounds which you have suggested as the limit beyond which the
                        powers’ demand should not go.</p>
                    <p>It appears premature as yet to attempt to indicate what will be the solution
                        of the question or the amount finally presented as a demand on China, but I
                        am daily being strengthened in my belief that very considerable reductions
                        will have to be made, even if an increase in the tariff of customs duties on
                        foreign imports to a 5 per cent effective is agreed upon.</p>
                    <p>I inclose herewith a translation of a communication sent me by the Viceroy at
                        Wu-chang, Chang Chih-tung, giving his views on the easiest way for China to
                        meet the indemnity demands of the powers; also a telegram from the Viceroy
                        at Nanking, and my reply thereto, bearing on the same subject.</p>

                                Collègue:</hi></p>
                        <p>In compliance with the wish expressed by my honorable colleagues, I have
                            to submit in writing to the financial committee under your excellency’s
                            presidency the statistical data and the conclusions they suggest to me,
                            which I mentioned in this morning’s meeting of the representatives of
                            the powers.</p>
                        <p>After consulting the market price of the various loans of powers whose
                            financial condition is brilliant and also of others in a less-favored
                            condition I find, for example, that the French rentes at 3 per cent, as
                            well as the Russian 4½ per cent <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0163"
                            />and the Russo-Chinese loan at 4 per cent, are all actually above par,
                            particularly the first mentioned, which is at 101.37, the second at
                            100.5, and the third at 101.90.</p>
                        <p>This leads me to believe that with the common guaranty of the powers
                            China could readily make a loan of £70,000.000 at 4 or 4½ per cent. With
                            the guaranty of the powers the issuing banks would be satisfied with 7
                            per cent commission, which would leave at the disposal of China a sum of
                            £65,100,000, sufficient for the payment of the indemnities. If the loan
                            is made at 4 per cent the annual payments would be £2,800,000, or
                            18,200,000 Haikwan taels, counting the pound sterling at taels 6.50. In
                            case of a loan at 4½ per cent the annual payments would amount to
                            £3,150,000, or 20,475,000 taels, respectively.</p>
                        <p>If furthermore, the necessary loan is made by China itself without
                            guaranty of the powers, I agree entirely with the financial committee in
                            believing that not less than 23 per cent of commission would be exacted
                            for issuing this loan. Consequently, to have an available sum of
                            £65,000,000 a loan of £84,500,000 would have to be negotiated. I take
                            the liberty of doubting whether such a loan could be secured at 5 per
                            cent, as the financial committee thinks it could, and I believe that the
                            creditors would not be satisfied in this case with an interest less than
                            7 per cent, which for the total amount of £84,500,000 would require an
                            annual payment of £5,915,000, or 38,447,500 Haikwan taels.</p>
                        <p>Comparing this latter figure with that of 18,200,000 taels requisite as
                            annual payment on a guaranteed loan at 4 per cent, I reach the
                            conclusion that China would incur a clear annual gain of 20,247,500 (<hi
                                rend="italic">sic</hi>) Haikwan taels in case this guaranty of the
                            powers was refused and if she were abandoned to her own resources for
                            the loan which she needs.</p>
                        <p>Passing to an examination of the proposal of the Government of the United
                            States of America that the powers should be satisfied with a lump sum
                            payment of £40,000,000, it is necessary to state in the first place that
                            the sum total of the claims of the powers being estimated at
                            £65,000,000, this would entail on them a loss of 38.46 per cent of the
                            indemnities to which they are entitled. If to secure these £40,000,000
                            China should have to do without the guaranty of the powers, she would be
                            obliged under the above-mentioned conditions of 23 per cent commission
                            and 7 per cent interest to make a loan of £51,935,000, with annual
                            payments of £3,630,450, or 23,597,925 Haikwan taels.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, with the guaranty of the powers, which would reduce
                            the commission to 7 per cent, China could secure £40,000,000 by making a
                            loan of £43,000,000, which at 4½ par cent would necessitate an annual
                            payment of £1,935,000, or 12,677,500 Haikwan taels, and at 4 per cent of
                            £1,720,000, or 11,180,000 Haikwan taels. In the latter case the
                            difference for China between the loan guaranteed by the powers and one
                            without such guaranty would be 12,417,925 Haikwan taels a year.</p>
                        <p>Independently of these considerations, I have been struck by the fact
                            that foreign banks, according to information which has reached me, held
                            that the annual service of the Chinese loans amounted to 21,000,000
                            taels, whereas the financial committee estimated it at 24,000,000 taels,
                            a figure which has also been confirmed to me by Sir Robert Hart.</p>
                        <p>Seeking to explain the reason of such a contradiction, on examining
                            carefully the printed list in a newspaper of the loans made by China and
                            of the annual service of its debt, the figures for which agreed with
                            those which had been given me by the inspector-general of customs, I
                            remarked that they had been calculated on the basis of 1 Haikwan tael
                            equaling 2 shillings 9 pence.</p>
                        <p>According to this list the service of the debt should be: <table rows="6"

                        <p>Taking as a basis the average value of the tael during the years 1896,
                            1897, and 1898, the data which have been used in the calculations of the
                            financial committee, and counting it consequently as equal to 3s.
                            .079d., we obtain the following results: If the annual service of the
                            debt is calculated at 24,500,000 Haikwan taels, with the tael equal to
                            2s. 9d., it would only be 21,976,000 Haikwan taels, if the value of the
                            tael is taken at the above-mentioned figure of 3s. .079d. Adding to this
                            last figure the yearly salaries of the personnel of the customs,
                            calculated at 14 per cent of the gross revenue, or according to
                            information supplied by Sir Robert Hart, 3,000,000 taels, we get the
                            figure of 24,976,080 Haikwan taels as the sum total of the indispensable
                            yearly expenditures to be furnished from the revenues of the maritime
                            customs. These revenues, as well as those from the likin, levied by the
                            customs administration, amounting, according to the calculations of the
                            financial committee, to 28,500,000 Haikwan taels, on an average, there
                            should therefore be a yearly balance from them of 3,519,920 taels;
                            balance ought to increase yearly as the sum assigned to the service of
                            the loans constantly decreases.</p>
                        <p>Among the resources indicated by the financial committee, taking even the
                            lowest figures calculated, the tax on native junks should furnish
                            3,000,000 taels: the raising of the customs tariff to an effective 5 per
                            cent ad valorem, 2,500,000 taels; and their raising to 10 per cent,
                            according to rough calulation, 10,000,000 taels besides the 2,500,000
                            above mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Adding the above-mentioned sources of revenue, which can be concentrated
                            in hands of the maritime customs administration, we reach a yearly total
                            of 19,023,920 taels, which a loan made at 4 per cent with the guaranty
                            of the powers would only require, as has been pointed out previously,
                            annual interest to the amount of 18.200,000 taels, which would still
                            leave to China a balance of 823,920 taels.</p>
                        <p>Should the revenue of the customs not increase quite a much as expected
                            after the raising of the tariff, this surplus could be used to make up
                            the difference, and to the same purpose could be assigned the revenues
                            for the customs taxes which it is proposed to impose on articles
                            imported until now free of all duty as being destined for the use of
                            foreigners.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the authorization of the new loan could, even in case of
                            necessity, only begin after some years, when the decrease in the sum
                            applicable to the service of the old loans shall have left to the
                            customs revenues a larger balance.</p>
                        <p>Please accept, etc.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I beg to inform you that in the matter of
                            the question of indemnity the United States Government has been very
                            moderate and equitable (in its demands).</p>
                        <p>I have now received another telegram from Mr. Wu, Chinese minister at
                            Washington, stating that the honorable Secretary of State had repeatedly
                            telegraphed his excellency Commissioner Rockhill to get the best results
                            in all matter (discussed). For this I am exceedingly grateful.</p>
                        <p>I now learn that the foreign governments demand an indemnity of
                            450,000,000 taels. China could only place bonds on the market at 70, and
                            this would require a loan of 600,000,000 taels to meet the above amount.
                            A ready money payment (issued on bonds to mature) in thirty years,
                            paying annually—principal and interest—30,000,000 taels, would mean a
                            total of 900,000,000 taels. On hearing this I was amazed and worried.
                            The Chinese people are poor, and the debt of China enormous. The United
                            States Government is fully aware of China’s condition in this
                            respect.</p>
                        <p>Sometime ago I heard that the United States Government took the
                            iniatiative with a view to reducing the amount of indemnity, but,
                            although the other powers would not assent to the proposition made,
                            still China is profoundly grateful for the great favors and kindly
                            intention shown by the United States. The amount of 450,000,000 tales as
                            indemnity is very excessive, and to negotiate a loan on that basis would
                            mean that the bank doing the business, as well as the foreign
                            governments, would receive the same amount, which is certainly not in
                            accordance with the principle of equity.</p>
                        <p>By Article VI of the Joint Note “China shall adopt financial measures
                            acceptable to the powers, for the purpose of guaranteeing, etc.” This
                            evidently refers to an <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0165"
                            />indemnity to be paid during a period of years. But if ready money is
                            paid, what is the use of guaranteeing payment, and what necessity is
                            there that China’s financial measures should be acceptable to the
                            powers?</p>
                        <p>I would suggest that the United States Government first get the amount of
                            indemnity reduced to the very lowest limit, and then persuade the powers
                            to agree to the amount, and payment in full to be made in ten years.
                            Further, that the payment of a ready-money indemnity be not
                            demanded.</p>
                        <p>As to the plan for providing the amount of indemnity, I may say that my
                            private views are that it will take a long time for China to meet its
                            liability, if the money is to be obtained in fragmentary amounts, as it
                            would be impossible by this process to get together a large amount at
                            any one time; small amounts would not suffice.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese husbandman is very poor, and it would not do to increase the
                            land and grain taxes he has to pay. There remains, then, the customs
                            revenue, the likin revenue, and the salt revenue that could be applied
                            to the payment of the indemnity. The duties should be increased double,
                            irrespective of goods, whether foreign or native, opium whether foreign
                            or native, or whether the duties are collected by the foreign or native
                            customs. But an increase of duties on foreign goods would exempt them
                            from the payment of likin. This would be a very simple, short, and
                            equitable way of dealing with the matter and an easy and clear way of
                            procedure.</p>
                        <p>If the amount of indemnity could be reduced to within 400,000,000 taels,
                            to be paid in ten years, then the amount received from the above three
                            sources would be ample. This plan is really a guarantee and should be
                            acceptable to the powers.</p>
                        <p>I have telegraphed the honorable Secretary of State, the British, German,
                            and Japanese Governments, asking that this proposition be considered,
                            and now express the hope that you will telegraph his excellency Mr.
                            Commissioner Rockhill, asking him to consider the question of a reduced
                            indemnity, to be paid in a period of years, and not demand a ready-money
                            payment. For this I shall feel grateful.</p>
                        <p>The above plan is merely my private views on the subject. I should be
                            glad to have you ascertain by telegraph without delay Mr. Rockhill’s
                            views on the subject, in order that I may present the question to my
                            Government and to the minister superintendent of southern trade for due
                            consideration.</p>

                            and all claims amount to 450,000,000 taels. They ask China to state what
                            financial measure they propose taking to meet demand when made. This
                            affords China opportunity stating her ability to pay and financial
                            measure proposed.</p>
                        <p>Viceroy should urge his views through Chinese plenipotentiaries. United
                            States will do all it can to prevent lasting financial embarrassment to
                            China. We prefer administrative reform and increased privileges to
                            foreign trade to large cash indemnity.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 9th instant the diplomatic corps held a
                        meeting in which the inclosed letter from the Chinese plenipotentiaries
                        concerning modification of Court ceremonial as regards reception of foreign
                        ministers was read and an answer agreed upon.</p>
                    <p>In my dispatch No. 69, of April 16, 1901, I inclosed translation of a letter
                        from Field Marshal Count von Waldersee concerning the military measures
                        necessary to carrying out Articles VIII and IX of the Joint Note and of the
                        reply made to it by the diplomatic corps. This reply was met by another
                        letter from the field Marshal, dated April 29. The diplomatic corps
                        considered to-day the advisability of making a reply to it, and decided to
                        defer doing so, after a prolonged discussion of the question. The military
                        authorities, as is shown by the letter of the marshal, which I inclose, are
                        desirous of separating the question of the presentation of the indemnity
                        claim from that of the guarantees for its payment to be given by China, and
                        think that the evacuation should only commence after the first demand has
                        been made. The diplomatic corps is of opinion, however, that the two
                        questions should not be separated. In the rather desultory discussion which
                        was had on this letter of the field marshal it developed that the majority
                        of the ministers were of opinion that reduction of the forces should be made
                        at once and that the Chinese authorities should be more and more associated
                        in the local administration. The French minister is particularly active in
                        urging this view, in which I availed myself of every opportunity to express
                        my hearty concurrence.</p>
                    <p>On the 11th instant the diplomatic corps held another meeting for the
                        consideration of questions connected with the Provisional Government at
                        Tientsin and the so-called diplomatic quarter of this city. In connection
                        with the latter subject, the French minister asked that a categorical answer
                        should be given by all present, whether they accepted or not the creation of
                        a glaçis around the diplomatic quarter, which had been strongly advocated by
                        the military commission in its report, copy of which was sent you in Mr.
                        Conger’s No. 536, of February 16 last. The British minister and I said that
                        we were in the impossibility of agreeing to it; that the whole subject had
                        been referred to our Governments. Pending the receipt of instructions, each
                        legation could do, within the ground which it occupied, whatever it pleased.
                        The French and German ministers are particularly interested in the question,
                        as on part of the ground which they wish to convert into a glaçis American
                        citizens (Mr. Lowry and Dr. Coltman) hold property which they now want to
                        improve. I was asked if I could not prevent them taking any steps in this
                        direction until the question of the glacis had been finally settled. This I
                        declined to do, stating that I could in no way restrict the rights of
                        American property owners in China.</p>
                    <p>In my dispatch No. 36, of March 7, I referred to a resolution of the
                        diplomatic corps of November 6 of last year, sent to you by Mr. Conger on
                        the 4th of March, in his dispatch No. 558. This resolution having again come
                        up before the diplomatic corps in connection with property owned by American
                        citizens in this quarter, I informed my colleagues that pending receipt of
                        categorical instructions from you I refused to consider myself in any way
                        bound by its terms; that Mr. Conger had agreed to it subject to the approval
                        of his Government <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0167"/>this approval not
                        having as yet been given, I did not propose to inquire into the property
                        titles of any American citizen here, whether any had acquired property since
                        the 20th of June of last year or not. This question is an important one, and
                        may give rise to frequent misunderstandings. I beg that I may be instructed
                        on the subject, as I requested in my dispatch of March 7.</p>
                    <p>A letter from the Chinese plenipotentiaries, making objection to carrying out
                        the provisions of the Joint Note concerning the suspension of examinations
                        in the cities and towns where foreigners had been murdered or cruelly
                        treated, was also read to the diplomatic corps, and an answer was agreed
                        upon. I inclose translation of both these papers.</p>
                    <p>The conservancy of the Whangpu River is one of the questions which interest
                        most deeply the mercantile community of Shanghai, and the present moment
                        appearing opportune for having this much-needed work undertaken and a
                        Conservancy Board created, the diplomatic corps, in its meeting of the 9th,
                        appointed a commission, composed of the French, German, and British
                        ministers and myself, to report on the question and recommend a plan for
                        carrying it out. I have good hope that this most important undertaking for
                        foreign trade will be promptly put in the way of final settlement.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: On the 18th of April we had
                            the honor to receive a communication from your excellency in which you
                            submitted the conclusions arrived at by the foreign representatives in
                            regard to the ceremonial to be observed at audiences of His Majesty the
                            Emperor.</p>
                        <p>Though the ceremonial is in accordance with the form prevailing in the
                            European countries and the United States, still there are certain points
                            which we find it difficult to comply with. They are four in number,
                            which we submit for the consideration of the foreign representatives: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>As to general audiences being held in the T’ai-ho Tien, we
                                    would point out that this throne hall is used by the Emperor,
                                    who ascends the throne on the occasion of great celebrations and
                                    when His Majesty receives New Year’s congratulations. When the
                                    Emperor ascends the throne, the insignia carried before the
                                    Emperor, the Emperor’s traveling equipage or escort, the whip
                                    which is cracked, and the band of music must be arranged in due
                                    order. The princes, dukes, and civil and military officers are
                                    assigned places in the courtyard where are the stones marking
                                    their rank. The rules are very strict, and not the least
                                    disorder will be allowed. The Emperor must appear in full court
                                    dress, and the forms of etiquette are multifarious. It is
                                    therefore inconvenient to hold audiences granted to foreign
                                    representatives there. If a change is made and audiences held in
                                    another hall, this would seem to be more suitable.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>In the matter of the foreign representative presenting his
                                    letters of credence, or a letter from the head of his State, on
                                    which occasion an Imperial sedan chair should be sent for him,
                                    we would state that it is not convenient to send the chair the
                                    Emperor rides in. The Imperial Household naturally should
                                    prepare a sedan chair, such as used by the high officials of the
                                    first rank, to be sent for the minister. This would be in
                                    accordance with the rules of state. There is practically no
                                    difference in the above system to that prevailing in European
                                    countries.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>As to the question that the foreign representatives should be
                                    taken to the steps of the audience hall and should be taken back
                                    therefrom, we would observe that heretofore princes, dukes, and
                                    ministers of state, on going to the Forbidden city, alight from
                                    their chairs outside of the Tung Hua gate and the Hsi Hua gate,
                                    as the case may be. An exception, however, has been made by
                                    special decree in the case of Prince Kung, the uncle of the
                                    Emperor, and Prince Chün, the father of the Emperor, who are
                                    permitted to take their chairs to the Ching Yun gate on the east
                                    side and to the Lung Tsung gate on the west side. In European
                                    countries the <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0168"/>foreign
                                    representatives take the carriages, but they are not allowed to
                                    go to the front of the steps of the audience hall. It appears
                                    that there is no distinction made in this rule. The question
                                    should receive further consideration and changes be made.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>As to the question that if banquets are given, as has been
                                    done in previous years, these should take place in the
                                    Chien-ching Kung and the Emperor should assist in person, we may
                                    observe that the ceremonial at banquets given by sovereigns of
                                    foreign countries to diplomatic representatives is not the same.
                                    That banquets should he given in the Chien-ching Kung and the
                                    Emperor assist in person is still a trivial matter, and changes
                                    can be made by way of accommodation or compromise. But as to
                                    banquets being given, this is a matter optional (with the
                                    Emperor), and one that can await further discussion.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The above we present as being our views for your excellency’s further
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>In a word, no matter what form of courtesy China shows to the foreign
                            representatives, on no account will it be other than on a footing of
                            equality between the two countries concerned without loss of
                            prestige.</p>

                            had the honor to receive your communication in reply to the one which I
                            had sent you on the 18th, and to inform you of the views of my
                            colleagues on the subject of the Court ceremonials on the reception of
                            foreign representatives by His Majesty the Emperor.</p>
                        <p>My colleagues request me to inform you in reply to your letter that the
                            hall of the Imperial Palace called Chien-ching Kung, which they pointed
                            out as the best for the audiences to separate foreign representatives
                            with His Majesty, being also suitable for audiences given to the whole
                            diplomatic corps, they modify the demand transmitted in my letter of the
                            18th of April in that sense. The Chien-ching Kung shall be the hall in
                            which shall take place all solemn audiences given by His Majesty the
                            Emperor to the representatives of the powers, whether individually or
                            collectively.</p>
                        <p>As to the Imperial sedan chair which should be sent to the dwelling of
                            the representative of a foreign power, etc., for the presentation of his
                            letters of credence, etc., my colleagues understand by that that it
                            shall be a sedan chair of the Imperial color, similar to those used by
                            His Majesty.</p>
                        <p>The explanations which you have given concerning the place where the
                            foreign ministers should get out of and get back into their sedan chairs
                            when they shall be admitted into imperial audiences have not seemed
                            satisfactory to my colleagues, who insist in this connection, and
                            subject to the modification accepted by them in the choice of the hall,
                            on the right which they have asked for. In consequence they will leave
                            and take again their chairs at the foot of the steps leading up to the
                            hall.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the banquets which His Majesty the Emperor might give to the
                            representatives of the powers, my colleagues request me to inform you
                            that the only bearing of their demand is to prevent that hereafter the
                            Emperor shall invite them in another building than one of those of the
                            Imperial palace, and shall be represented at the banquets offered by him
                            and in his name by some one else. But it never entered into their minds
                            to make it obligatory for His Majesty to send to the diplomatic agents
                            invitations to dinner.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: I hasten to forward to your
                            excellency, after a conference with the commanders of the contingents of
                            the allied troops, the following reply to your letter of the 25th
                            instant:</p>
                        <p>1. The following powers will bear their share in the 6,000 men to be left
                            behind in Tientsin and the district belonging to it: Great Britain,
                            France, Germany, and Japan, each 1,400 men; Italy, 400 men.</p>
                        <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0169"/>
                        <p>For the 1,500 men to he left behind in Shanhaikwan-Chin-wangtao, Great
                            Britain, France, Japan, Russia, and Germany will each furnish 300 men.
                            Italy wishes to leave a company there until the forts are razed.</p>
                        <p>2. As long as Chinese territory remains occupied by troops of the allied
                            contingents the military commanders must have full authority over the
                            civil administration. This has also been laid down in principle in the
                            proceedings of the Hague conference in the year 1899. It is possible,
                            and it would even be of advantage for both parties, that the Chinese
                            authorities should retain their functions, as is now the case entirely
                            in Paotingfu and partly in Tientsin.</p>
                        <p>In Tientsin and the administrative district appertaining to it, which
                            reaches as far as Taku and comprises both banks of the Peiho, 6,000 men
                            of the international troops have to be quartered in the future, and to
                            these must be added 600 French troops destined for the protection of the
                            railroad and numerous small detachments of all contingents for the
                            protection of the various military establishments in Tongku and below
                            it. We must therefore also reckon the ships of war which will be always
                            stationed in the Peiho to keep up communication with the international
                            fleet lying in the roadstead of Taku. To permit that under any
                            circumstances these should be dependent upon a Chinese mandarin is an
                            impossibility.</p>
                        <p>Friction would at once arise which might lead to dire conflicts, and such
                            a measure should be avoided.</p>
                        <p>The placing of the civil administration under military supervision would
                            also have the great advantage that it would be very unpleasant for the
                            Chinese Government, and that this latter would therefore do its best to
                            get rid of the situation by a speedy fulfillment of the terms of
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>When the time comes for the reduction of the troops occupying Tientsin to
                            2,000 (?) men, it would be possible to accommodate them in the
                            concessions, and it might be taken into consideration that then Chinese
                            civil administration might be allowed in full measure.</p>
                        <p>3. The creation of a commander in chief is desirable for purely military
                            reasons. Whatever be the measures taken in case of trouble, there must
                            be a single center from which the orders emanate, and these should also
                            apply to the 2,000 men of the garrison in Peking.</p>
                        <p>4. According to my information, it is not quite correct to say that only
                            banner troops were quartered in Peking, for I understand that there was
                            also a strong garrison of troops with modern armament.</p>
                        <p>5. To provide for the commencement of the evacuation of Peking it would
                            be advisable to allow the Chinese authorities for four weeks previously
                            a greater share of responsibility than hitherto, but they must always be
                            under military control.</p>
                        <p>6. As regards the question as to whether at present a partial evacuation
                            of Pechili might be carried out, opinions were divided. The British,
                            Japanese, and German commanders were of the opinion, which I share, that
                            such an evacuation can not take place before China has accepted the sum
                            total of the indemnity to be paid, while the French commander informed
                            me that he had proposed to his Government to withdraw 8,000 to 9,000
                            men, beginning fourteen days hence and finishing in six weeks’ time, and
                            that preparations for this had been made. He added that he would only
                            leave colonial troops here, in view of the difficult climatic conditions
                            to be encountered. The Italian and Austrian commanders were without
                            instructions on this point. General Chaffee offered no observations.
                            Russia was not represented, as General de Wogack could not be
                            present.</p>
                        <p>All the commanders have requested me to inform your excellency, and to
                            request that you will inform the diplomatic corps of the following
                            opinions, which they adopted unanimously:</p>
                        <p>In view of the approaching hot weather, which will be very
                            disadvantageous for the health of the troops, and in view of the
                            difficult nature of the roadstead of Taku, the question of the
                            evacuation of Pechili is an extremely difficult one, which calls for the
                            most earnest consideration and in which delay will, in addition to an
                            enormous increase in the cost of the war, cause probably the loss of
                            many hundreds of soldiers, and the retention of the troops perhaps till
                            next winter.</p>
                        <p>We are unanimously of the opinion that the question would find a quicker
                            solution if the fixing of the amount of the indemnity were treated
                            separately from the manner in which China is to raise the money.</p>
                        <p>The second part of the question may, in view of the difficulties of the
                            matter, require several months for its solution. If the question of the
                            indemnity is first taken in hand and China declares its readiness to pay
                            the sum demanded, the time would have come for beginning the evacuation,
                            the completion of which would even then take several months, so that the
                            reduction of the army of occupation would be very gradual. We are
                            convinced 2,000 in Peking, 6,000 men in the Tientsin <pb n="164"
                                xml:id="pg_164" facs="0170"/>district, 1,500 men in Shanhaikwan, and
                            about 3,000 men along the railway-in all, 12,500 men—with an
                            international fleet at the Taku roadstead, and an international garrison
                            in Shanghai, with a fleet at the Woosung roadstead, will be absolutely
                            sufficient to force China to accept our conditions as to how the
                            indemnity is to be paid.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: On the 2d of May we received
                            from the Grand Council, at Si An, a telegram stating that the governor
                            of Hunan had wired that by the terms of the Joint Note there shall be a
                            “suspension of all official examinations for five years in all the towns
                            where foreigners have been massacred.” It appears that in the matter of
                            the missionary cases in Wei-yang and Ch’ing-chuan, in the Hunan
                            province, these were the result of trouble brought about by rebels, and
                            not the literati, and naturally the order of suspension should not apply
                            there. The trouble only occurred in the towns of Huang-sha-wan and
                            Chiang-tzu-k’ou, in the jurisdiction of the above-named districts. Even
                            if the examinations were to be suspended, it should only be done at the
                            two towns mentioned, where the trouble occurred. The suspension of
                            examinations merely refers to places where the Boxers created trouble
                            last year. This rule should not apply to missionary cases that occurred
                            in other places. If the examinations must be suspended, it would seem
                            necessary to clearly state that the suspension shall apply to the two
                            towns where the trouble occurred, and not involve the whole province.
                            This is important for the sake of justice and fairness.</p>
                        <p>Having received the above we would beg to observe that in the matter of
                            the suspension of examinations, correspondence on the subject have
                            passed between the foreign representatives and ourselves, but nothing
                            has been definitely settled.</p>
                        <p>We embrace the opportunity, however, of again expounding our views in a
                            clear and minute way.</p>
                        <p>The suspension of examinations for the period of five years refers to the
                            people living in the places where disturbances occurred—the result of
                            the Boxer movement—who can not compete during that time; it has no
                            reference to places where disturbances occurred, not the result of the
                            Boxer movement. Take, for instance, Peking, where last year a revolution
                            took place, resulting in loss of life to foreigners of all
                            nationalities. The native scholars resident in the capital are punished
                            by the examinations not being opened to them, which is perfectly right
                            and proper, but Peking is the capital of China, and the Chü jen of the
                            various provinces come here to enter the metropolitan examinations.
                            Then, as to the examinations for the second degree in the Shun-tien
                            prefecture, we may add that these are open to senior licentiates and
                            students of the imperial academy of the southern, northern, and central
                            provinces. This examination is not confined alone to students of the
                            metropolitan prefecture. If the metropolitan examinations for the third
                            degree and the metropolitan prefecture examinations for the second
                            degree are to be suspended, then in that case the students of all the
                            provinces will not be able to compete for the above degrees, and as a
                            result of disturbances in many cities and towns the scholars of the
                            Empire would all thus be cut off from entering the official carrier.
                            Besides, it is the illiterate vagabonds who cause trouble, and by such a
                            mode of procedure the peaceable, law-abiding scholars would in like
                            manner be implicated with them. Would this be strictly in accordance
                            with justice? Besides, foreign missionaries are a class associated with
                            the scholars of China, and if the examinations at Peking are suspended
                            to scholars this would create a feeling of enmity which would not be
                            befitting.</p>
                        <p>We therefore ask that the examinations be suspended only to persons
                            resident in the places where it is right they should be prohibited, but
                            not to those not living in said cities or towns where the disturbances
                            occurred. The examinations of an entire prefecture or district should
                            not be suspended; a discrimination should be made. The suspension of
                            examinations for five years should apply to places where the Boxers
                            created trouble last year; other places should not be affected by this
                            ruling.</p>
                        <p>In sending this communication to your excellency, we beg that you will
                            confer with your colleagues on this subject, and favor us with a reply,
                            in order that a memorial may be sent to the Throne, asking the issuance
                            of a decree in reference to the places contained in the list forwarded
                            to us some time ago re suspension of examinations.</p>

                            note of the 4th of May to communicate to my colleagues a telegram from
                            the Grand Council concerning the cities in which examinations should be

                        <p>You explain in this connection that in your mind the suspension of
                            examinations would consist “in the interdiction for residents in
                            localities in which troubles had taken place to present themselves for
                            the examinations during a period of five years, and not in forbidding
                            for five years that examinations should be held in the localities where
                            troubles had occurred.”</p>
                        <p>It is, on the-contrary, this last interpretation which is the true one.
                            To convince yourself of it it suffices to look at the text of paragraph
                            B, Article II, of the Joint Note, accepted by His Majesty the Emperor of
                            China. This paragraph reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Suspension of all official examinations for five years in all the cities
                            where foreigners have been massacred or have been subjected to cruel
                            treatment.”</p>
                        <p>You observe, in support of your explanations, that at Peking the
                            suspension of examinations would be prejudicial to people of all the
                            provinces who had not taken part in the trouble of last year, and you
                            add that “those guilty of the disorders were all illiterate men and
                            rascals.” You show yourself, in thus speaking, severe on the Princes and
                            high officials whom you have already recognized as responsible for the
                            crimes to which you refer. We doubt whether the criminals can be
                            considered as illiterate people, but we do not contest that they behaved
                            themselves like rascals.</p>
                        <p>On the contrary, it is, speaking in a general way, the literati who have
                            always been—particularly so last year—the true authors or accomplices of
                            the antiforeign movement, and the Chinese people are only responsible
                            for having allowed themselves to be dragged into the movement.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of the powers, therefore, insist on the demands which
                            they have made of you, and which are entirely in conformity with Article
                            II of the note which you have accepted.</p>

                        <p>(After acknowledging the receipt of the communication of the
                            representatives of the powers, the Chinese plenipotentiaries continue as
                            follows:)</p>
                        <p>The principle of indemnity having been decided upon and consented to by
                            Clause VI of the convention can only be admitted without discussion.
                            Nevertheless, we <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0172"/>can not
                            refrain from remarking that the enormous figure of 450,000,000 taels
                            indicated in the communication of the representatives of the powers
                            exceeds all our previsions.</p>
                        <p>The annual revenue of China does not exceed 88,000,000 taels, a sum
                            barely sufficient to defray public expenses. But in recent years,
                            through unforeseen events, new obligations have been added to the
                            ordinary expenses in the shape of loans, the sinking funds and the
                            interest on which amount to more than 20,000,000 taels annually, and
                            consequently at the present time the revenues of the State no longer
                            suffice for its expenses. These latter being furthermore increased by
                            the enormous figure of the indemnity, the representatives of the powers
                            will understand without trouble the nature of the new difficulties and
                            our embarrassment.</p>
                        <p>If we had to undertake to find in new sources of revenue the means of
                            providing for these increasing obligations, the carrying out of the
                            measures to be taken to attain that end would require considerable time
                            and would entail delays the length of which it is impossible for us to
                            foresee.</p>
                        <p>All that we can do for the present is to find among the already known
                            sources of revenue, however insufficient they may be, portions which
                            willingly or unwillingly can be diverted to guarantee the payment of the
                            indemnity, reserving to determine, on the other hand, the means
                            necessary to supply the domestic deficit which will result
                            therefrom.</p>
                        <p>After careful deliberation, we propose for the time being to take from
                            the revenues of the gabelle an annual sum of 10,000,000 taels, from
                            those of the native customs 3,000,000 taels, and from those of the
                            likins 2,000,000 taels, in all 15,000,000 taels, a sum which can always
                            be completed if necessary by means of an additional levy from the
                            10,000,000 taels of the metropolitan chest. There would thus be an
                            annual fixed sum of 15,000,000 taels reserved and specially devoted to
                            the payment of the indemnity, and the Imperial Maritime Customs would be
                            intrusted with taking the necessary measures for insuring its
                            regularity. Beginning with the twenty-eighth year of Kuang-hsü (July,
                            1902), the customs would make monthly payments of 1,250,000 taels into
                            the formally authorized banks, and out of these funds the banks would
                            transmit to each one of the interested powers the proportional part
                            allotted to it by the committee of the powers. In this way within a term
                            of thirty years this whole debt of 450,000,000 taels would be paid
                            off.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, although China thinks it possible for her to provide for
                            these new obligations, the financial difficulties which would result are
                            such that we hope the representatives of the powers will feel that there
                            is ground for reducing the enormous figure indicated in their
                            communication, and that with the object of preventing in some degree the
                            deficit produced by taking these funds from the Chinese treasury they
                            will consent that one-third above the present tariff be hereafter levied
                            on all customs payments. Their excellencies would thereby show to China
                            the sentiment of justice which animates them and their desire to
                            maintain a cordial understanding.</p>
                        <p>Such are the broad lines of the mode of procedure which we deem as a
                            commencement we should submit to the examination of the representatives
                            of the powers in reply to their communication, and we beg them to do us
                            the honor to give us their opinion, so that we may be in a position to
                            enter without delay into details of the steps which still remain to be
                            taken by both parties to reach a satisfactory settlement of this
                            question of indemnity.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: On the 27th of February I received
                            from your excellency a telegram requesting evidence as to the death of
                            Yü Hsien.</p>
                        <p>The execution of this latter is so little in doubt that I immediately
                            answered yon by telegraph: “Decapitated 22d February, 5 o’clock in the
                            morning.” If the dispatch was not sent the same day it was because the
                            operator who has charge of European telegrams was for the time being
                            absent.</p>
                        <p>Here are the principal proofs of the death of Yü Hsien. In the first
                            place the suicide of the governor, or rather of the Fan-tai (provincial
                            treasurer) who was occupying the place of the governor appointed but not
                            yet arrived. The said governor Li, formerly an official of Tai-yuan, had
                            treated Yü Hsien, formerly his superior, with high regard, due to his
                            title of ex-governor; not as a rebel and an exile. So as not to have the
                            blood of a superior on his hands and to thereby bring upon himself the
                            reproach of a crime nearly parricidal, he advised Yü Hsien to commit
                            suicide. Yü Hsien refused. On this, on the day of the nsw year, the
                            governor committed suicide.</p>
                        <p>The next day, and particularly the day after, the excitement grew greater
                            and greater among the people. Notices were posted up even inciting the
                            people to revolt. The Nieh-tai (provincial judge) had them torn down at
                            once and had numerous arrests made. Toward 9 o’clock in the evening he
                            called a meeting of the council officials and proposed that in view of
                            the tendency of the people to revolt, the day of the execution should be
                            advanced. (It had previously been fixed for the 6th.) Toward midnight
                            the judge sent a detachment of soldiers to guard the street, and he
                            himself went to the dwelling of Yü Hsien and notified him of his
                            sentence. On hearing this Yü Hsien ordered two of his wives to commit
                            suicide, and he nailed up their coffins, which had been got ready
                            beforehand, after which he continued to write letters.</p>
                        <p>The Neih tai waited in the street. It was already dawn when the judge
                            asked the condemned man for a second time to deliver himself into the
                            hands of justice. As Yü Hsien had been a governor, he was not to die by
                            the hand of the ordinary executioner. A military officer was intrusted
                            with the execution.</p>
                        <p>Arriving on the threshold of the door, the Neih-tai commanded Yü Hsien to
                            kneel, and he was executed. The first blow missed, so a servant of Yü
                            Hsien’s took a knife and, to spare his master useless suffering, cut his
                            throat. This was between 4 and 5 o’clock in the morning.</p>
                        <p>Such is the narrative which an eyewitness employed by a mandarin made the
                            same day to a Christian. Another one showed him the place of execution.
                            An official also present told the same story to Madame Splingaerd.</p>
                        <p>Add to this that down to the present day nobody contradicts this
                            narrative; this would be impossible if Yü Hsien were still living.</p>
                        <p>Please accept, Mr. Minister, the assurances of my most respectful
                            consideration, etc.</p>

                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">the death of chao shu-chiao.</hi></p>
                        <p>This ex-president of the board of punishments was ordered to commit
                            suicide. But on the 25th of the twelfth month last year the edict
                            ordered imprisonment until execution, and the provincial judge was
                            already charged with his custody and his relatives had gone to the
                            judge’s yamen to await the end. The day before the Empress said to the
                            privy council: “As a matter of fact Chao Shu-chiao did not patronize the
                            Boxer movement, only he should not have told me that the Boxer people
                            were not important.”</p>
                        <p>When Chao heard of these words he secretly rejoiced and hoped that the
                            old Empress would reprieve him. On the 29th there were many outside
                            rumors that the western men would condemn Chao Shu-Chiao to death;
                            whereupon the gentry and people of Hsian all rose up against it, and 300
                            of them presented a petition to the privy council, saying that the whole
                            city wished to save Chao Shu-Chiao from death. But the council did not
                            dare to present their petition to the throne. Hsueh Yen-Sheng, president
                            of the board of punishments, who is Chao’s maternal uncle, remarked: “If
                            Chao is beheaded, where are there left any heavenly <pb n="168"
                                xml:id="pg_168" facs="0174"/>principles of right? “But the reports
                            became more pressings and the council, from 6 o’clock to 11 o’clock,
                            held a consultation with the Empress, but could not decide to put Chao
                            to death. Meantime the streets were fast filling with people who
                            threatened to release Chao on the way to the execution ground and kill
                            some of the high officials at the same time. The council took fright and
                            asked the Empress to grant Chao the privilege of self-destruction. Tsen
                            Chun-hsuan came forward and recited the decree. Chao knelt and said: “Is
                            there a later decree?” Tsen replied, “No.” Chao said that there must be
                            another decree. Chao’s wife said to him, “Let us both die together;”
                            whereupon they both swallowed gold leaf. But from 11 to 3 p.m. it had no
                            effect, and a lively conversation with their friends was carried on
                            regarding what should be done after their death. They deeply mourned the
                            fact that they left a mother over 90 years old to mourn their end.
                            During this time their friends and relatives crowded to see them until
                            Tsen Chun-hsuan stopped them. We heard that Chao told his friends, “It
                            is Kang-I who has done for me.” Tsen, on seeing that Chaos voice was yet
                            clear as a bell and no prospect of dying, ordered him to take opium, but
                            still he did not die; whereupon arsenic was administered. Then for the
                            first time he lay down groaning, begging his friends to rub his chest.
                            He merely said he felt bad. By this time it was 11 o’clock at night, and
                            Tsen became impatient and said: “Six p.m. was the hour fixed for the
                            execution, and still he is not dead.” The attendants then suggested to
                            him to employ tough paper soaked in brandy to suffocate him. This was
                            done until the body was cold and gave forth no sound. His wife wept and
                            committed suicide. Chao’s friends say that this is proof that his
                            constitution was very robust. But others say that he took only a little
                            opium, hoping for a reprieve.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">death of prince chuang</hi>.</p>
                        <p>He awaited his fate at Pu Chow in Shansi at the guest house there. His
                            concubine and sons were with him. The order to execute him was given to
                            Ko Pao-hua, who arrived at the gate early in the morning. Prince Chuang,
                            hearing the firing of the usual guns at the reception of great
                            officials, came out and cursed them, saying: “Why do you tire guns
                            without any reason?” The bystanders said “The Imperial commissioner Ko
                            Pao-hua has come to see you.” Chuang said: “What has he to do with my
                            affairs?” They replied: “The Imperial commissioner is merely passing
                            this way.” When Ko entered, Chuang inquired minutely regarding the
                            fortunes of the court, but Ko did not say much in reply. Behind the
                            guest house there is an ancient temple. When Ko saw that there was a
                            small empty room of one <hi rend="italic">chien</hi>, he fixed on this
                            as the scene of Chuang’s death, and fixing the silken cord on a beam he
                            locked the door and returned to Chuang. He then ordered the magistrate
                            of Pu Chow and the local military to provide soldiers. He at once
                            ordered Chuang to kneel and listen to the edict. Hearing this Chuang
                            straightened up and said to Ko: “Do you want my head?” Ko did not reply,
                            merely reading the edict. Chuang replied: “I must commit suicide. Is
                            that it? I knew long ago that I must die, but probably the Old
                                Buddha<note n="1" xml:id="d113fn1">The Empress Dowager is popularly

                            May I take leave of my family?” He was told to dispatch his farewells
                            quickly. Chuang said to his son: “You must exert all your might for your
                            country. Do not allow the foreigner to seize your ancestors’ realm.” The
                            son was unable to reply for weeping, while his concubine fainted clean
                            away. Chuang asked where he was to die, and on being led to the place he
                            entered and saw the silk cord depending from the beam, remarking as he
                            caught sight of it: “Your excellency has managed the affair admirably
                            and with dispatch.” In an hour he was dead.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">death of ying nien</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Ying Nien was a man of no courage. When he heard of Chao Shu Chiao’s
                            imprisonment he used to spend whole nights in weeping, saying: “Prince
                            Ching ought not to desert me like this!” On New Year’s Day everybody was
                            too busy to mind him much. But at midnight suddenly there was a silence.
                            The next day at noon his family knew that he had fallen to the earth and
                            breathed his last. They rushed to the spot and found that his mouth was
                            stuffed full of mud. At this the edict had not yet arrived, and so they
                            did not venture to make his death public. But when the edict came on the
                            3d they reported to Governor Tsen that Ying Nien was already dead.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The difficulty for the representatives of the
                        powers to arrive at any kind of understanding, either as to the amount of
                        the indemnities to be asked of China or the mode of payment, is becoming
                        more apparent day by day. None of the methods suggested as to the mode of
                        paying the indemnities meet with approval.</p>
                    <p>On the 14th of this month the British minister handed me confidentially a
                        memorandum, copy and translation of which I inclose for your
                        information.</p>
                    <p>So far as I can ascertain from my colleagues the British and Japanese
                        Governments are the only ones which think we should insist, in case we have
                        to give the Chinese increase of their import customs tariff, on obtaining
                        from China compensating commercial concessions.</p>
                    <p>Russia, France, and Germany are willing to see the present tariff on imports
                        raised to 10 per cent, if by so doing they can obtain more promptly the
                        payment of their claims against China.</p>
                    <p>The Russian minister, and I fancy his French colleague will side with him, is
                        most persistent in his desire to separate the financial from the commercial
                        question here, while the Japanese minister and myself are equally convinced
                        that the two must be treated together, and that if we make tariff
                        concessions to China without securing settlement of the commercial questions
                        we lose the most powerful leverage we have here and expose ourselves to
                        years of desultory discussion with China before we may be able to settle one
                        of the questions which so pre judiciously affect foreign trade.</p>
                    <p>The Russian and French Governments are emphatic in their declarations that
                        the only mode acceptable to them for the payment of the indemnity by China
                        is a loan with joint guaranty by the powers; this would result, possibly, in
                        breaking up at an early date the present concert of the powers, which must
                        endure, though perhaps somewhat limited, if the plan of paying the indemnity
                        by the issue of bonds to run for thirty or forty-five years is adopted.</p>
                    <p>The British minister to-day read me the last instruction he had received from
                        his Government on the subject of the payment of the indemnity. It
                        practically reproduced the previous memorandum, with the exception of the
                        proposition to reduce the amount of 450,000,000 taels to 400,000,000. I
                        telegraphed you this afternoon, giving the substance of the British
                        memorandum and the later instruction of the British Government.</p>
                    <p>The diplomatic corps will hold a meeting the day after to-morrow, to consider
                        the reply of the Chinese plenipotentiaries indicating the means China
                        proposes for paying the indemnities to the powers. From present indications,
                        however, I greatly fear that it will take a great deal of telegraphing
                        before anything definite is accomplished, most of my colleagues being
                        apparently without any liberty of action whatever.</p>
                    <p>The wisdom of the proposal which you made to the powers in the early part of
                        the year, to hold a conference in Europe or America for the settlement of
                        these questions is made from day to day more apparent, and their refusal to
                        accept your proposal is a source of constant regret to me.</p>

                                <item>Second. The increase of the import duties beyond 5 per cent ad
                                    valorem is inadmissible, unless the questions indicated in
                                    article 11 of the Joint Note are settled in a satisfactory
                                    manner.</item>
                                <item>Third. Not to take part in a joint international guaranty of a
                                    Chinese loan.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>On the other hand, propositions from China for a decrease of the total
                            amount and for indulgence concerning the conditions of payment would be
                            considered favorably.</p>
                        <p>The following plan might perhaps be feasible: China should hand to each
                            of the powers bonds representing, at par, the proportion due each
                            interested power. These bonds would bear 4 per cent interest with
                            one-half per cent sinking fund.</p>
                        <p>The following revenues would be set aside for the payments on these
                            bonds: The gabelle, native customs, and the increase of receipts
                            accruing from a duty of 5 per cent ad valorem on imports by sea and by
                            land, except on rice and opium.</p>
                        <p>(This latter would continue to pay the duties of the present tariff,
                            which amount to 4.97, as import dues, plus 80 taels a picul; in all
                            about 19 per cent.)</p>
                        <p>These revenues would be paid to a mixed commission, the organization of
                            which should be approved by the powers. It would, however, not have any
                            right to interfere directly in the administration nor in the imposition
                            and perception of customs duties.</p>
                        <p>The payments to the commission should take place at frequent intervals.
                            [The proposition of a monthly payment made by the Chinese
                            plenipotentiaries seems to correspond to this idea.]</p>
                        <p>The commission would have charge of the distribution.</p>
                        <p>Right for each power to dispose of its bonds as it sees fit, and to
                            guarantee them.</p>
                        <p>To give to China the necessary time to settle its affairs the issue of
                            bonds could be extended. [It could commence by issuing 300,000,000; the
                            balance as soon as the interest on its present debts commence to
                            decrease, perhaps after five years.]</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The diplomatic corps held a meeting to-day to
                        consider the note of the Chinese plenipotentiaries indicating how they
                        proposed paying 450,000,000 taels, if this amount were asked as indemnity by
                        the powers. Copy of this note was sent you in my dispatch No. 86 of May
                        16.</p>
                    <p>Sir Ernest Satow had but a few days before informed me privately-that his
                        Government advocated the reduction of the total amount of the indemnity to
                        400,000,000 taels. This I duly telegraphed you on the 20th instant. Much to
                        my astonishment, but as I learned later, as a result of a further concession
                        made at the last moment by the British Government to Germany, which it was
                        apparently feared might join Russia and France in insisting on a guaranteed
                        loan, he informed the diplomatic body to-day that his Government was in
                        favor of a method which, while effecting a reduction of the amount to be
                        asked of China, would not change appreciably the figure already
                        mentioned—that is to say, 450,000,000 taels. He therefore proposed that
                        after July 1 of this year the powers should not demand of China any further
                        payments on account of the military occupation. This, it is estimated, would
                        be a saving to China of not less than 1,500,000 pounds a month.</p>
                    <p>The Austrian, German, and Russian ministers were opposed to this proposition,
                        the German minister expressing himself most strongly on the subject, saying
                        that his instructions directed him to insist on the integral payment of
                        every cent spent, or to be spent, by his Government on the expedition to
                        north China. I fancy, however, his Government has before this practically
                        accepted the British proposal.</p>
                    <p>The Russian minister, while not so emphatic, declined to commit himself to
                        accepting the date of July 1, though he is personally in favor of it.</p>
                    <p>The British proposals (see my No. 89) were then read and there ensued a
                        general exchange of views, when I took occasion to say that while reserving
                        for future presentation to the diplomatic corps the proposal of my
                        Government concerning the amount of the indemnity, which had not yet been
                        accepted or rejected by the representatives of the powers, I felt at liberty
                        to say that the United States would be pleased to see whatever indemnity
                        might be asked of China paid by the issuance of bonds by the Chinese
                        Government without international guaranty. If this were agreed to, we would
                        be willing to take them at par and at 3 per cent interest.</p>
                    <p>The German minister then remarked that in view of my statement that I would
                        again bring up the suggestion of the American Government to scale down the
                        indemnities, he would ask his colleagues to finally vote on the subject. He
                        said he was not aware that any of the powers saw any reason for limiting the
                        figure of their demands on China <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0178"/>to
                        £40,000,000, as we had suggested, especially in view of the note of the
                        Chinese saying they could pay 450,000,000 taels, and of the note of Viceroy
                        Chang Chih-tung offering to pay 400,000,000 in ten years. I replied we were,
                        on the contrary, more convinced than ever that the figure we had indicated
                        was the highest China could pay without getting into serious financial
                        difficulties; that the report of the committee on the payment of indemnities
                        was full of proofs of this; that the Chinese plenipotentiaries, while saying
                        that China could pay this amount if called on, insisted on the fact that it
                        would create grave financial disturbance in the country. As to the
                        proposition of Chang Chih-tung (copy of which I sent you in my No. 82), it
                        was not to be seriously considered, as it was practically based on doubling
                        the customs dues and the likin, two measures we all refused to entertain,
                        especially the second. I then said that if a vote was adverse to the
                        original American proposition, I would then ask the diplomatic corps to vote
                        on whether they agreed to make any reduction.</p>
                    <p>Mr. von Mumm then submitted to the diplomatic corps the following question
                        which it was understood was intended to cover the whole of the American
                        proposition:</p>
                    <p>“Do the powers agree to ask of China as indemnity the expenses actually
                        incurred by the Governments and the losses of societies and individuals,
                        reserving for future determination the question of the advisability of
                        limiting the figure of the indemnity to be asked of China to the 1st of
                        July—that is to say, to the sum of 450,000,000 taels?”</p>
                    <p>All of the ministers voted affirmatively, the Russian minister stating,
                        however, that he simply voted with the majority, though his Government was
                        equally willing to accept the American principle of scaling down the demands
                        or to ask the payment of all expenses incurred. I did not vote.</p>
                    <p>Continuing the discussion of the British proposition, the suggestion therein
                        contained, that the indemnity should be paid in bonds, was next taken
                        up.</p>
                    <p>The Russian minister objected to this method, saying that bonds were only a
                        promise to pay and left the future too unsettled. For this reason his
                        Government proposed a guaranteed loan. He also advocated the raising of the
                        tariff on foreign imports into China to 10 per cent, because we require, to
                        insure the payments that have to be made on account of the indemnities, the
                        very best guaranties, and that in view of our ignorance concerning native
                        revenues, he thought that we should confine ourselves to those collected by
                        a foreign administered service.</p>
                    <p>The British memorandum proposed, as one of the sources of revenue for the
                        payment of the interest on the debt, the increase of the tariff on foreign
                        imports to a 5 per cent ad valorem effective.</p>
                    <p>All the ministers agreed to this with the exception of myself. I said the
                        United States Government would not agree to any increase of the present
                        tariff without compensating commercial advantages; that the concessions
                        which we could make China on the tariff constituted the most powerful
                        leverage we had on the country for settling a number of questions, and we
                        could not relinquish this valuable right except with full assurances that
                        these commercial grievances would be promptly righted. I trust my action
                        will meet with your approval. I think that I may thus be able to secure the
                        cooperation of my colleagues in insisting with the Chinese Government on the
                        immediate undertaking of the conservancy work on the Shanghai River; also
                            <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0179"/>those needed on the Tientsin
                        River, and possibly at Niuchwang. Besides these I think we may secure their
                        aid in having Peking placed on the footing of a treaty port. These are the
                        compensations I shall at all events insist upon pending your
                        instructions.</p>
                    <p>Before the meeting adjourned a note to the Chinese plenipotentiaries, asking
                        them to indicate how they proposed paying interest on a sum of 450,000,000
                        taels, was agreed upon. I inclose herewith translation of said note.</p>
                    <p>Further discussion on the subject of the British memorandum was reserved
                        until to-morrow.</p>

                            honor to acknowledge to your highness and your excellency receipt of the
                            letter which you were pleased to send me in reply to my communication
                            dated May 7 concerning the indemnities. In the letter to which your
                            highness and your excellency have just replied we informed you that the
                            approximate figure of the expenses incurred and of the losses sustained
                            by the powers amounted to the sum of 450,000,000 taels, calculated to
                            the 1st of July of the current year.</p>
                        <p>In reply to this communication your highness and your excellency have
                            informed me that the Chinese Government proposed to pay off this sum to
                            the powers by monthly payments of 1,250,000 taels during thirty
                            years.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of the powers have not failed to transmit this
                            proposition to their Governments. But they must call the attention of
                            your highness and your excellency to the fact that the total of the
                            payments proposed by the Chinese Government only represents the capital
                            of the sum mentioned, without the question of interest having been taken
                            account of.</p>
                        <p>I consequently beg your highness and your excellency to be so kind as to
                            inform us as soon as possible of the intention of the Chinese Government
                            in this respect.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The diplomatic corps continued to-day the
                        discussion of the British proposals for the payment of the indemnity by
                        China.</p>
                    <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0180"/>
                    <p>The first question taken up was that of the mode of payment—whether a
                        guaranteed loan should be asked for or whether China should issue bonds.</p>
                    <p>The French minister said that the only instructions he had on the subject
                        were those given some time ago to his predecessor, Mr. Pichon. France
                        preferred the system, of a guaranteed loan, as being the simplest and most
                        natural method, and the one which best equalized the conditions in which the
                        loan would have to be made. Though he had no recent instructions, he thought
                        that France would regulate her conduct on considerations of general interest
                        and of the particular interest of China, whose restoration we were seeking,
                        and without which the necessary means for discharging her newly incurred
                        indebtedness could not be secured.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese minister said his Government preferred an international
                        guaranty, if all the other powers agreed to this plan.</p>
                    <p>The German minister pronounced himself in favor of the issuance of bonds, but
                        stated (I presume as his personal opinion) that he saw no objection to some
                        of the powers guaranteeing between themselves the bonds issued to them by
                        China.</p>
                    <p>The Austrian, Belgian, and Dutch ministers were without instructions.</p>
                    <p>The Italian minister said that his Government had no preference for one over
                        the other mode.</p>
                    <p>I repeated what I had said the day before as to the preference of the United
                        States for bonds without an international guarantee and our willingness to
                        take them at par and bearing 3 per cent interest.</p>
                    <p>I am inclined to think, in view of the decided preference expressed to-day
                        for the issuance of bonds by China for the payment of her debt, together
                        with the statement of the French minister and the fact that the Russian
                        minister did not further urge the views of his Government, that the British
                        proposals will be very shortly agreed to by all the representatives.</p>
                    <p>The question of the sinking fund was then taken up by the ministers, and
                        after some desultory discussion it was decided to request the Committee on
                        the payment of the indemnities to have drawn up a number of plans of
                        amortization, it being the understanding of the foreign representatives that
                        the Chinese preferred to extinguish the debt within the shortest period
                        possible, say thirty years.</p>
                    <p>The question of the interest on the bonds was also discussed, Great Britain
                        proposing 5 per cent and the United States 3 per cent.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese minister remarked that he thought, if the debt were paid off in
                        bonds, that some provision should be made for the countries which can not
                        raise loans at a very low rate of interest; Japan, for example, had to pay 5
                        per cent. He suggested as a possible solution, in case a low rate was
                        finally agreed upon, that an additional amount of bonds over and above that
                        which represented the amount of the indemnity due be issued to the countries
                        thus situated, so as to cover the difference between the amount of interest
                        they would have to pay for a loan and the rate of interest insured by the
                        bonds.</p>
                    <p>This plan does not seem to me to be practicable and would work a great
                        hardship on China. * * *</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: * * * My cablegram to you of the 22d informed
                        you of the sudden change in the British Government’s proposals, and that the
                        representatives of the powers had practically agreed to demand of China the
                        full amount of the expenses incurred by their Governments, subject to their
                        being finally closed for presentation to China at the end of the month of
                        June. In other words, the sum of 450,000,000 taels is approximately the
                        minimum of the demand they will make on China.</p>
                    <p>In my dispatch No. 92, of the 22d instant, I explained this last phase of the
                        negotiations and gave an explanation of Great Britain’s repeated changes in
                        her proposals. I may add that the British proposal to reduce the amount of
                        the indemnity to £50,000,000, which I telegraphed you on April 26, was never
                        submitted formally by Sir Ernest Satow to the conference.</p>
                    <p>The position of Germany on the question of the indemnity has, as I have
                        advised you repeatedly, been most un compromising. The urgent necessity for
                        Great Britain to maintain her entente with Germany in China is, of course,
                        responsible for the numerous concessions she has recently made to German
                        insistence on being paid the last cent of her expenses. The most remarkable
                        of these concessions is found, however, in the British Government’s
                        willingness to have the tariff on imports raised to an effective 5 per cent
                        ad valorem, without compensating commercial advantages. * * *</p>
                    <p>It is true that the proposal of the United States to scale down the indemnity
                        has not been met with the approval of a single one of the powers, but our
                        insistence in the cause of moderation has unquestionably been instrumental
                        in forcing them to limit their demands. Had it not been for our endeavors,
                        China would, without a doubt, have been obliged to consent to infinitely
                        harder terms than those which will be probably submitted. The American
                        policy of moderation has had other distinctly beneficial results. * * *</p>
                    <p>The President’s policy of moderation brought about a revision of the lists of
                        proscription, and has thus saved many persons, now known to be innocent,
                        whose names had been placed thereon in the heat of the moment.</p>
                    <p>In numerous other ways have the United States been able to exercise a
                        moderating influence in the councils of the powers, while still maintaining
                        the concert which, clumsy as it undoubtedly is, is still, so long as it
                        exists, a tolerable guarantee of the maintenance of Chinese integrity and of
                        equal trade privileges for all the world. I firmly believe that we shall be
                        still further able to vindicate in other ways the wise policy of the
                        President during the remainder of the negotiations, and by it greatly
                        benefit American interests in China.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The diplomatic corps held a meeting to-day for
                        the discussion of pending questions.</p>
                    <p>A note was prepared to the Chinese plenipotentiaries concerning the limits of
                        the diplomatic quarter in this city. This note practically settles the whole
                        question. I will send you copy of all correspondence bearing on this point
                        of the negotiations as soon as I can get them together.</p>
                    <p>By referring to the British proposals concerning the payment of the
                        indemnities (see my dispatch No. 89), you will find it there suggested that
                        the payments on account of the indemnities should be made by the Chinese
                        Government to a mixed commission, which would distribute them among the
                        powers in proportion to their claims. To-day the committee on the payment of
                        indemnities, to further expedite the discussion of this subject, made the
                        following report to the conference. I quote it in full: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The committee on the payment of indemnities is of opinion that the
                                committee of encashment (committée des recettes) proposed by the
                                British Government should be composed of the heads of the foreign
                                banks at Shanghai designated by the interested Governments to
                                receive in common the sums of money which they shall have collected
                                from China. The said committee of encashment should confine its
                                operations to cover in the total amount of the sums due, dividing it
                                among the powers proportionately to the amounts due each one of
                                them.</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>This subject can, of course, only be settled when the mode of payment of the
                        indemnities has been finally decided upon.</p>
                    <p>The German minister then stated that his Government, desirous of bringing
                        about as promptly as might be a settlement of the question of indemnity, had
                        accepted the proposition of the British Government to limit the amount of
                        the indemnity to be asked of China to the approximate sum of 450,000,000
                        taels, calculated to the 1st of July of this year, with interest of 4 per
                        cent, reserving for future determination the question of the amortization.
                        His Government was ready to ask at once of the Chinese Government a guaranty
                        for the payment of this sum and for the interest specified.</p>
                    <p>The Italian minister also informed the conference that his Government
                        accepted the British proposal to limit the demand to the 1st of July, and to
                        accept the approximate figure of 450,000,000 taels.</p>
                    <p>None of the other ministers had received instructions from their Governments,
                        but it is highly probable that at the next meeting most of them will be able
                        to announce their formal adherence to the British proposal.</p>
                    <p>I have informally informed several of my colleagues that I would ask you
                        whether you would accept the British proposal but I have not held out any
                        hope of your doing so. I have, on the contrary, said that it only remained
                        for me now to ask that the whole subject of the indemnity be transferred to
                        the Arbitral Court of the Hague. This has given my colleagues a good deal of
                        uneasiness, and they greatly fear the delay which such a motion on the part
                        of our Government might occasion, though they all feel convinced that a
                        reference of the question as you suggest would not be agreed to by any of
                        their Governments. As I am convinced of the truth of this also, I shall not
                        formally make the suggestion unless directed to do so by you.</p>
                    <p>The above subjects having been temporarily disposed of, the question <pb
                            n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0183"/>of replying to the last letter of
                        the Chinese plenipotentiaries concerning the suspension of examinations for
                        a period of five years was taken up.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese have already agreed to the suspension of examinations in all
                        cities and towns where foreigners were massacred or cruelly treated, with
                        the exception of Peking and Tai-yuan Fu, the capital of Shansi. They
                        contend, and with some degree of reason, that it is not fair to close the
                        provincial and metropolitan examinations—the latter of which must be held in
                        Peking, and once in every three years only—to people who have never been
                        hostile to foreigners, and who belong to towns where no massacres or riots
                        occurred.</p>
                    <p>The Russian, French, and Japanese ministers are in favor of a compromise. The
                        whole question of Chinese examinations is, however, so badly understood by a
                        number of the foreign ministers that they hesitate very much to come to any
                        decision on the subject. The discussion to-day did not result in any
                        progress being made toward a final understanding. * * *</p>

                        information, translation of an Imperial Edict directing the Chinese
                        plenipotentiaries to bring to a prompt close the peace negotiations, so that
                        the Emperor may return to his capital.</p>
                    <p>The general belief among foreigners in Peking is that the Court will not
                        start on its return to Peking until the entire withdrawal of the
                        expeditionary forces from Peking and the neighborhood, and until such time
                        as the only foreign forces here are the legation guards. I heard from
                        various sources, however, that some preparations have been made along the
                        roads which will be followed by the imperial party, and also in the
                        Forbidden city, for the Emperor’s return.</p>

                        <p>On the 1st day of the fourth moon (May 18) the Grand Council, at an
                            audience, received the following Edict:</p>
                        <p>The governor of Shun-t’ien (Peking) has twice petitioned us on behalf of
                            the gentry and people, begging us to return (to the capital), and now
                            again the members of the censorate unite in a joint memorial (to the
                            same effect). All of this is evidence of the sincere affection and
                            longing (of our subjects).</p>
                        <p>Formerly we respectfully begged the Empress Dowager to halt at Chang-an
                            (Si-ngan) and, gazing from this great distance upon the ancestral
                            shrines and altars of the tutelary dieties, we have been constantly
                            filled with sorrow, and could not but most earnestly desire to return,
                            and thus satisfy the wishes of the ministers and people of the whole
                            Empire.</p>
                        <p>Let Prince Ching and Li Hung-chang bring the peace negotiations quickly
                            to a close and cause the foreign troops to be withdrawn, that it may
                            become possible for us to set a day for our return.</p>
                        <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0184"/>
                        <p>Prince Ch’ing and his associates, too, should publish this Edict for the
                            information of the ministers and people.</p>
                        <p>As to the time of Our return, it will be necessary for the Court to have
                            everything properly prepared, and we appoint Shi Hsu to put things in
                            order beforehand.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The diplomatic corps in its meeting of to-day
                        read a letter from Field Marshal Count von Waldersee in reply to one sent
                        him by that body on the 24th of last month, in which it had expressed its
                        opinion that the Provisional Government at Tientsin should hand over its
                        powers at the earliest date possible to the regular local Chinese
                        authorities. The marshal reasserts his opinion that this Provisional
                        Government should be maintained as long as there is any considerable foreign
                        military force in Peking. I inclose copy of the marshal’s letter; also one
                        of the reply agreed upon to be made.</p>
                    <p>The opinion of the diplomatic corps on this point was submitted to and
                        received the approval of the various Governments, and the field marshal was
                        so informed. Since then nothing has occurred to alter the belief that the
                        evacuation of the native city of Tientsin and the transfer by the
                        Provisional Government to the Chinese authorities of the authority with
                        which it was intrusted by the commanders of the troops in north China during
                        that period of disorganization resulting from the occupation of Tientsin
                        should be brought to a close as soon as possible, just as is being done now
                        in other parts of this province held by foreign troops.</p>
                    <p>The marshal’s letter has been referred by the various ministers to their
                        Governments for final instructions on the matter. I beg you will give the
                        subject your early attention.</p>
                    <p>I informed you in my dispatch No. 85, of the 13th instant, that the
                        diplomatic corps was endeavoring to reach a conclusion on the subject of the
                        suspension of the metropolitan examinations, which the Chinese
                        plenipotentiaries think should be excepted from the operation of paragraph
                        B, article II, of the Joint Note. This subject was taken up again to-day and
                        two proposals made. The first stated that while the powers could hold out no
                        hope of an amelioration of the terms of the demands for the suspension of
                        examinations in all the towns and cities where foreigners had been massacred
                        or had been subjected to cruel treatment, the conditions in which the
                        metropolitan examinations take place (these examinations can only be held in
                        the capital of the Empire and under the nominal direction of the Emperor,
                        who confers in person some of the degrees then competed for) not existing,
                        the powers reserved to examine later on the question of these
                        examinations.</p>
                    <p>I voted against this proposal, which, in my opinion, would leave the whole
                        question unsettled.</p>
                    <p>The Russian minister then proposed that the metropolitan examinations at
                        Peking should be allowed only for graduates of provinces in which foreigners
                        had not been massacred or been subjected to cruel treatment.</p>
                    <p>I voted for this proposal, as I did not think it was the intention, of the
                        United States at least, to punish people from those provinces of <pb n="179"
                            xml:id="pg_179" facs="0185"/>China which had taken absolutely no part in
                        the antiforeign movement of last year. Neither of these two proposals,
                        however, securing a majority of votes, the question is again deferred for
                        future consideration.</p>
                    <p>The Russian minister informed the conference that he had received from his
                        Government instructions to accept the proposal in the British memorandum
                        relating to the payment of the indemnities, and which provides for a
                        committee of encashment, to receive from China the various payments which it
                        will have to make on account of the indemnity, and to distribute them among
                        the interested powers in proportion to their various claims.</p>
                    <p>I understand by this that the Russian Government abandons its proposal to
                        secure any loan with an international guarantee for the payment of the
                        debt.</p>
                    <p>This afternoon the private secretary of Li Hung-chang informed me that the
                        Emperor had accepted the demand of the powers for 450,000,000 taels as
                        indemnity, and had agreed to the payment of interest thereon at 4 per cent,
                        though His Majesty’s Government hope that it will be found possible to
                        slightly reduce this amount.</p>
                    <p>In this connection I transmit herewith for your information copy of a
                        telegram which I received on the 26th instant from the Viceroy Chang
                        Chih-tung. While this telegram is in reply to one I sent him on the 17th
                        instant, copy of which was inclosed in my dispatch to you, No. 90, of the
                        20th instant, the latter part of it relates to the question of the payment
                        of indemnity.</p>
                    <p>The diplomatic corps not having yet considered formally the question of the
                        interest to be demanded of China, I have not yet replied to the Viceroy’s
                        telegram.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: Referring to my letter of the
                            29th of April, I have the honor to again submit to your excellency, as
                            dean of the diplomatic corps, the following considerations concerning
                            the council of Tientsin:</p>
                        <p>The council of the provisional government of the district of Tientsin was
                            created several days after the capture of that city, the transfer of the
                            whole administration to the hands of the military authorities appearing
                            an inevitable necessity.</p>
                        <p>To render possible the accomplishment of the duties which devolved upon
                            it, it became necessary to extend little by little the area of its
                            administration, so that this includes to-day not only the city of
                            Tientsin itself, but also the neighboring territory along two banks of
                            the Peiho as far as Taku, inclusively.</p>
                        <p>All the allied powers, with the exception of Austria-Hungary, are
                            represented in the council, the organization of which, generally
                            speaking, is the following: <list>
                                <item>First. General secretary; bureau of the council.</item>
                                <item>Second. Police, with a personnel partly military, partly
                                    native.</item>
                                <item>Third. Treasurer, to settle all financial business.</item>
                                <item>Fourth. Justice, to decide all judicial differences, and to
                                    judge all penal cases which can not be concluded directly by the
                                    chiefs of the police or the chiefs of districts.</item>
                                <item>Fifth. Public works, to finish works already commenced; to
                                    take up again and execute such works as are deemed desirable for
                                    the military interests or general interests.</item>
                                <item>Sixth. Salubrity, to prevent epidemics and to establish better
                                    conditions less dangerous for the public health than those
                                    existing at the present day.</item>
                                <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0186"/>
                                <item>Seventh. Chinese secretary, to make all necessary
                                    translations, to decide all demands, complaints, and requests
                                    made orally, to draw up proclamations, etc.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the four districts of the suburbs of which are under the
                            orders of a chief of district, to whom is confided the maintenance of
                            peace, and who is competent to decide directly disputes and questions of
                            minor importance.</p>
                        <p>These chiefs have in the two largest districts as assistants two and
                            three officers, respectively, and they have the services of
                            noncommissioned officers and soldiers of the allied forces for the duty
                            of police inspectors and police soldiers, so as to superintend, with
                            their assistance, the police service, which is, as a general thing,
                            performed by the native police.</p>
                        <p>The staff directing the above-mentioned divisions (with the exception of
                            the Chinese secretary) is naturally composed at the present time
                            exclusively of persons of the nationalities of the allied powers. Their
                            number, however, is confined to the strictest limits. The subordinates,
                            however, are already at the present time recruited as much as possible
                            among the natives.</p>
                        <p>The above-mentioned organization, whose principal duty is to facilitate
                            as much as possible by the measures which it adopts the accomplishment
                            of the object which the allied forces can have in view, has, as a
                            general thing, filled perfectly all requirements, and has been able to
                            gain the confidence of the Chinese population. In my opinion, it would
                            be impossible to replace it advantageously at the present time by a new
                            organization.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, referring to my letter of the 29th of April to your
                            excellency, I find myself obliged to point out again that, as my
                            personal opinion and as that of the commanders of the contingents, it is
                            absolutely necessary that the administration of the district of Tientsin
                            should remain under military authority as long as international troops
                            in any considerable number are stationed there. The effective force
                            amounts at first to at least 7,000 men, since it is necessary to add to
                            the 6,000 men constituting the contingent of occupation 600 men of
                            French troops, destined to protect the railroad, several Russian
                            military posts at Tientsin, Tongku, and Taku, as well as station guards
                            (etapes) at the two last-mentioned places.</p>
                        <p>But if, as I have had the honor to state in my above-mentioned letter,
                            submitting the administration of the occupied territory to military
                            authority is in perfect accordance with the stipulations of the
                            conference of The Hague of 1899, which were approved and adopted by the
                            powers, on the other hand no doubt can be entertained that the
                            transmission of the administration of the district in question to the
                            Chinese Government would inevitably lead in a short space of time to
                            most embarrassing complications, the consequences of which can not be
                            foreseen between that Government and the military authorities, as these
                            latter must depend for the satisfaction of a number of their wants on
                            the measures adopted by the administration, being only able to count on
                            its assistance for securing them.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I take the liberty of again noting that the settlement
                            of these difficulties would cause the diplomatic corps much useless and
                            protracted preoccupation. But, putting aside even the question of the
                            feasibility of making the allied contingent dependent on the orders of
                            Chinese officials, the multiplicity of allied contingents represented in
                            the army of occupation would increase this indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>I see, furthermore, in the preservation of the administration under
                            military authority a most efficacious means of obliging the Chinese
                            Government to keep those promises to which it has already
                            subscribed.</p>
                        <p>If, as I do not think possible, a common commander in chief for the
                            international troops should be created, he would have the position of a
                            military governor, to whom it would be then necessary without further
                            consideration to submit a civil administration; but even he could not do
                            better than to use the provisional council which already exists and is
                            discharging well its duties while gradually increasing the Chinese
                            functionaries in it.</p>
                        <p>In the probable case of such a commander in chief not being appointed, I
                            believe, as formerly and without any reservation, that nothing better
                            could be done than to allow the provisional council to subsist, while
                            pledging it to add Chinese functionaries gradually and always in
                            increasing numbers in its administration.</p>
                        <p>The fact that the work of the council extends exclusively to the Chinese
                            city of Tientsin and other Chinese territory, while that of the consular
                            body is essentially limited to the concessions, seems to make it quite
                            possible that the two corporations should exercise their duties without
                            at all clashing, and it will be simply a question of tact on the part of
                            the one and the other to escape all misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p>I take the liberty of again submitting to the consideration of the
                            diplomatic corps the question of eventually deciding whether it would
                            not be desirable in the future that the council should count among its
                            numbers a representative of America, which power is not leaving any
                            occupation forces at Tientsin.</p>

                        <p>I have duly received your excellency’s telegram and have perused the
                            various points which you consider suitable and advantageous to trade.
                            Trade is the basis of a country’s prosperity. I perceive that all of the
                            points presented in your excellency’s telegram have for their object the
                            question of the expansion of trade. If regulations can be fixed that
                            will prevent abuses, prove a benefit to China, advantageous to the
                            trading classes and ordinary people, I shall be very pleased to consider
                            them. As to the point referring to the working of mines and proper
                            regulations, thus opening China’s sources of wealth, if uniform system
                            can be devised and action taken in accordance therewith, this would be a
                            business at present of exceeding importance. I shall be glad to consider
                            the matter, and, after a decision has been arrived at, to memoralize the
                            throne, asking permission to undertake the work. In your excellency’s
                            telegram you state that the United States desire is to obtain commercial
                            privileges. At the present time the amount (of indemnity) is very large,
                            the foreign powers demanding 450,000,000 (taels) at 4 per cent interest,
                            covering a period of thirty years. A payment of 26,000,000 annually is
                            to be made. The Chinese people are poor, and to demand further payments
                            from them to meet this enormous indemnity would still reduce the traders
                            and people to an impoverished state. The demand for foreign goods, in
                            consequence, would be reduced, and this would be at variance with the
                            idea of the United States to have commerce and trade developed. I
                            earnestly beg that your excellency will discuss the question with the
                            foreign representatives of reducing the indemnity; also the rate of
                            interest at least 1 or half of 1 per cent. The former American
                            (British?) minister Sa (Ma? McDonald) named the rate of interest at 3.7
                            per cent. If the rate can be reduced it would make it much easier for
                            the people to bear, and trade would gradually develop. This would prove
                            equally advantageous to both foreigners and Chinese. If this can be done
                            I will be ever, ever so grateful. Please favor me with a reply by wire
                            at your early convenience.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of
                        your telegram of the 28th instant. * * *</p>
                    <p>To-day I was informed by the private secretary of Li Hung-chang, and the news
                        was confirmed later in the day by several other Chinese officials attached
                        to the staff of the Chinese plenipotentiaries, that an Imperial edict was
                        received yesterday by Prince Ching and Li agreeing to pay an indemnity of
                        450,000,000 of taels and 4 per cent interest.</p>
                    <p>The other foreign representatives have also been advised by he <pb n="182"
                            xml:id="pg_182" facs="0188"/>Chinese of the willingness of their
                        Government to pay the above-mentioned sum. There is, therefore, no
                        possibility of our suggestions to either reduce the amount of the indemnity
                        or transfer the whole question to The Hague tribunal being considered, and I
                        shall agree to the sum of 450,000,000 as soon as I learn that it is accepted
                        by all of my colleagues.</p>
                    <p>The sum of 450,000,000 of Haikuan taels (United States gold, $333900,000)
                        will of course be subject to some change by the adjustment of the private
                        claims. It represents the maximum of the sum which China acknowledges she
                        owes the powers. All the powers, excepting the United States, have
                        intrusted, I believe, the adjustment and determination of the amounts
                        allowable on the claims of their nationals to their diplomatic
                        representatives here, who will be guided by the rules adopted by the
                        conference (the United States always excepted), a copy of which rules I
                        transmitted to you in my dispatch No. 42.</p>
                    <p>As to our claims, I have given the figure as United States gold $25,000,000,
                        and have stated that it covered all claims of every description. * * *</p>

                        information copy of a letter addressed to me by Li Hung-chang under date of
                        May 17, urging that he may be permitted by the commander of the
                        international forces to use the regular Chinese forces at his command to
                        restore order in the province. A similar letter was addressed to the other
                        representatives and to Field Marshal Count von Waldersee.</p>
                    <p>I also inclose translation of the letter the field marshal has addressed to
                        the military commanders here, detailing the steps he has taken to comply
                        with Viceroy Li’s request.</p>
                    <p>I am informed that there are now about 13,000 Chinese regulars in the
                        province, and that several thousands more of Yuan Shih-kai’s foreign-drilled
                        troops are shortly expected to arrive from Shan-tung. These latter, Viceroy
                        Li has told me, will be employed as a police force in Peking as soon as the
                        foreign troops are withdrawn. They are the best disciplined troops In China,
                        and I think will discharge their delicate duty in Peking well.</p>
                    <p>It is hoped that a date for the evacuation of Peking may be agreed upon at a

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to inform you
                            that I have received a communication from Major-General “Kai-lu” (i. e.,
                            Von Gayl) saying that he had received a dispatch from Count von
                            Waldersee stating that in the region, south and southwest of Cheng-ting
                            Boxers were daily increasing in number and that if China were unable to
                            quickly exterminate them he proposed to send a large force and <pb
                                n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0189"/>pursue them straight into the
                            borders of Shansi and clear them out. On this account General “Kai-lu”
                            had written me the above letter, which was submitted for my examination,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>As to this matter I have to say that the Boxers were originally idle
                            vagabonds who at first did no more than pretend to be expert jugglers,
                            hoping thereby to assemble a crowd of followers and fool them out of
                            their money. Later they presumed on the name of enemies to the church to
                            stir up ill feeling and cause the ignorant populace to join them, and
                            lest the local officials should seize them they again changed their
                            tactics and adopted the motto, “Protect the Ch’ing and destroy the
                            foreigners,” to manifest their loyalty and to cover up all traces of
                            rebellious designs. It never occurred to me that the principal local
                            officials and high ministers of state would neglect to search out their
                            treasonable conspiracies, but instead become their leaders, even to the
                            extent of deceiving those who were in the palace into listening to their
                            angry and lawless words till the fire had spread abroad and could not be
                            extinguished; and after the allied armies of all countries had come to
                            the capital these Boxers fought again and again before they learned that
                            they could not overcome. Then they changed their clothes, became
                            farmers, or fled to their holes, or went into hiding.</p>
                        <p>On receiving the Imperial commands transferring me to the capital I sent
                            orders to all the civil and military officials under my authority,
                            commanding them in a large proclamation to use their energies and seize
                            (these offenders). Although in every chou and hsien men were being
                            continually seized and executed by the military authorities, these
                            altogether did not amount to more than one or two in a hundred, and the
                            greater part had the good fortune to escape. According to the usual
                            procedure, strict orders ought to be given to search out and arrest
                            them, that the evil may be rooted out. But there is no help, for
                            wherever the allies go if they see our soldiers their suspicions are
                            aroused at once and they either prevent our soldiers moving forward or
                            search and seize their rifles and cannon, with the result that our
                            troops, even in their distant camps outside the “red line,” are unable
                            to carry on any operations. Should they have occasion to attempt to
                            seize robbers they are stopped by repeating rifles and quick-firing
                            guns, so that the Boxers have dangerous weapons and our men almost none
                            at all and can only sit down with their hands tied. All this is due not
                            to the fact that our Government does not desire to seize the Boxers, nor
                            is it that they are unwilling to quickly exterminate them; still less is
                            it that our troops are not strong enough to deal with the Boxers. It is
                            simply because of the allies’ interference in every place that things
                            have come to this pass.</p>
                        <p>Now that peace negotiations are in progress and the troops are soon to be
                            withdrawn, the duty of dealing with local bandits is one that ought to
                            devolve upon myself. Count von Waldersee speaks of quickly exterminating
                            them. Naturally it is our own desire that the country should be quickly
                            pacified. If the foreign powers are in earnest in their desire for
                            international good will they should allow us quickly to put down the
                            rebellion among the people, and I have to request that they will give
                            orders to their various district commanders to permit me to gather and
                            arrange troops and order the various camps to divide the country among
                            them, assume responsibility each for its own section, and take proper
                            weapons and use diligence in exterminating (these offenders). I dare
                            guarantee that within one or two months all roads will be quiet and
                            orderly and that there will be no more danger of Boxers. But it ought to
                            be clearly agreed that our troops shall have a permit, written in all
                            languages, and that should they meet with any foreign troops on the
                            road, on inspection of this permit, they shall be allowed to pass. Thus
                            mutual clashing will be avoided. In such a case the ministers of the
                            various powers residing in Peking on the one hand should inform their
                            military officials at all points, and on the other should give a permit
                            in 10 odd sections (?), which should first be sent to me, commanding
                            each army, on examination of the permit, to allow the bearers to pass,
                            that there may be no more interference with their marching nor seizing
                            of their arms. Then friendly intercourse will prevail, and China and the
                            foreign powers more than ever have mutual peace. Since last year the
                            armies of the various powers have in our stead dealt with the Boxers,
                            but the speech of the foreign soldiers can not be understood by the
                            people, and when these latter flee it is impossible to distinguish
                            honest folk from Boxers and very difficult to get hold of the latter.
                            Therefore the use of foreign soldiers in dealing with the Boxers is not
                            to be compared in effectiveness with our seizing them ourselves. As in
                            duty bound, I send this dispatch for your information, and I have to beg
                            that your excellency will give it your favorable consideration. I trust
                            you will readily respond to this request, and I shall anxiously await
                            your reply.</p>

                        <p>So as to furnish the Chinese Government the opportunity of proving its
                            good will and its ability to maintain with its own forces tranquillity
                            and order in the country, I have agreed with the grand secretary, Li
                            Hung-chang, that, beginning on the 26th of the present month, the
                            Chinese regular troops shall have full liberty of moving about in the
                            region to the north and to the east of the line of Cha-tao, Huai-lu,
                            Ping-ku Hsien, San-ho Hsien, and Pan-ti Hsien (including these
                            localities), and shall be charged with repressing brigandage.</p>
                        <p>In the south also, in conformity with the wish expressed by your
                            excellency that Sin-lo should be the extreme point of the occupation in
                            the south, I have drawn the line of demarcation of the points occupied
                            by the allied troops so that it follows now the course of the Mu-chu Ho,
                            to the north of Ho-chien and to the south of Sin-lo.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to request your excellency, in case you agree with me,
                            to inform the troops under your orders of the above facts, and to be so
                            kind as to request them not to interfere with the movements of the
                            Chinese troops, passes having been delivered to the Chinese generals in
                            question within the region which is assigned to them, and under no
                            circumstances to attack them.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, I have requested the grand secretary to inform me
                            immediately of the places to which he intends bringing Chinese troops in
                            greater numbers, so that in the case of an eventual evacuation by the
                            allies of the cities of Peking and Paoting Fu they can undertake the
                            rapid occupation of those points.</p>

                        communication addressed by the Chinese plenipotentiaries to the dean of the
                        diplomatic corps, in reply to the note of the latter under date of the 22d
                        instant (copy of which was inclosed in my No. 92 of that date) asking what
                        steps the Chinese Government proposed taking to pay the interest on the
                        indemnity.</p>

                            representatives of the powers, the Chinese plenipotentiaries continue as
                            follows:)</p>
                        <p>In considering in a previous dispatch the question of indemnities we
                            explained to your excellency the penury of the Chinese treasury.</p>
                        <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0191"/>
                        <p>In your last communication your excellency is pleased to call our
                            attention to the fact that the annual payments of 15,000,000 taels which
                            we proposed only represent the capital, and you now call our attention
                            to the question of interest.</p>
                        <p>As we on our side had already considered that besides the capital there
                            was also to be taken into consideration the question of annual interest
                            at 4 per cent, we had already, by telegram, submitted to the Throne
                            propositions on this subject, and in reply we have received an Imperial
                            edict stating that “The figure of 450,000,000 of indemnities to be paid
                            the powers, with interest at 4 per cent, is approved,” and we are
                            commanded to take the necessary measures to carry out this decision:</p>
                        <p>We have therefore only to comply with the orders of the Throne.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, this obliges us to recall to your excellency that the
                            financial resources of China are so restricted that nothing more can be
                            taken from them possibly beyond the 15,000,000 taels which we have
                            already proposed to your excellency to devote specially to the payment
                            of indemnities; but as this sum must not only supply payment of the
                            capital but also that of the interest, we have no other alternative to
                            propose than to prolong the term of payments, which we had in the first
                            place fixed at thirty years, in such a way that the installments paid
                            during the first period of this term thus extended shall be considered
                            as destined to extinguish the capital, while those made during the
                            second period shall be applied to liquidating the interest account,
                            after which all payments would cease through the extinction of the
                            debt.</p>
                        <p>The Imperial Maritime Customs already intrusted, as we had proposed, with
                            the payments of the capital, would likewise be intrusted with the
                            payments on account of interest. As to the amount of the annual
                            interest, it would be understood that it would decrease proportionately
                            every year, according to the progressive reduction of the capital.</p>
                        <p>We have the honor to request your excellency to kindly inform us what you
                            think of the plan we suggest above to pay off both capital and interest,
                            or if in your opinion it would not be better to consider a portion of
                            the 15,000,000 taels paid annually as an installment on the capital to
                            be paid off, and the balance as an installment on the interest. These
                            details require a careful examination, and demand a previous and full
                            understanding between the parties.</p>
                        <p>China having thus shown its good will in assenting to the demands of the
                            powers on the question of the indemnity, and in taking all the necessary
                            steps to insure an integral payment of it, we hope to have soon the
                            satisfaction of learning that the powers are in a position to fix an
                            early date for the evacuation.</p>
                        <p>We have the honor to request your excellency to kindly communicate the
                            above to the representatives of the powers.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that the
                        expeditionary forces in Chihli are being rapidly reduced, and that within
                        the next month some 15,000 to 20,000 men will probably be withdrawn. The
                        German minister communicated to the diplomatic corps to-day a telegram from
                        the German Chancellor stating that “as none of the powers taking part in the
                        occupation of China has raised objections to the telegraphic proposal to
                        recall the commander-in-chief, and as the Emperor of China has reiterated
                        his formal promise concerning the payment of an indemnity of 450,000,000
                        taels, with interest at 4 per cent, the recall of the commander-in-chief
                        will be carried out at once. At the same time the German expeditionary
                        forces will be reduced to one brigade.” The brigade will be composed of 9
                        battalions of 300 men each.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese are taking back their time-expired men, and will probably keep
                        seme 3,000 to 5,000 men in Chihli. The French announced some weeks ago that
                        they were going to withdraw immediately between 8,000 and 9,000 men. Though
                        their withdrawal was temporarily suspended, it is probable that, now that
                        the Germans have <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0192"/>begun theirs, it
                        will be carried out. The British send a regiment off to Weihai Wei in a few
                        days, and I hear that ten transports have been ordered to come to Taku to
                        take away the other British troops.</p>
                    <p>In my dispatch No. 100 of the 30th ultimo I informed you of the steps being
                        taken to gradually hand over the policing of the province to the Chinese
                        forces. I have not yet been informed of the method to be followed in
                        transferring the control of this city to the Chinese authorities, but will
                        advise you of it as soon as I can.</p>
                    <p>I confirm my cablegram to you of this date.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The diplomatic corps met to-day to consider
                        the various plans of amortization of the Chinese indemnity. I inclose
                        herewith copies of the two schemes which were considered.<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d127fn1">Not printed.</note> The first, prepared by the agent
                        here of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, contemplates
                        amortization of the entire debt of 450,000,000 taels, with interest at 4 per
                        cent, in a period of fifty years. Its principal inconvenience is that it
                        does not apply to the amortization all the sums which in the next forty
                        years become available for that purpose by the gradual extinction of the
                        other foreign Chinese debts.</p>
                    <p>The plan of the Commission, which contemplates amortization of the entire
                        indemnity in forty-five years, is based on the principle that all accrued
                        balances left over from the reduction of the Chinese foreign debt are
                        applied to this purpose and no new charges made on China beyond the
                        18,000,000 taels necessary for the payment of the 4 per cent interest. The
                        amortization under this latter scheme, which was accepted in principle by
                        the diplomatic corps, commences in 1906.</p>
                    <p>The diplomatic corps also examined two schemes of amortization submitted by
                        the Chinese plenipotentiaries. The first plan contemplated repaying the
                        capital of 450,000,000 taels in thirty years, and afterwards paying for
                        twenty years the sum of 13,950,000 taels as interest, or 279,000,000 taels
                        as interest. This plan, of course, takes no account of compound interest and
                        does not figure out an ordinary interest of much over 3 per cent. The second
                        Chinese plan contemplates the amortization in forty years, and provides for
                        the addition to the capital of the total of the interest and the payment in
                        forty equal installments.</p>
                    <p>The question of the currency in which the indemnities would have to be paid
                        was also considered by the diplomatic corps, but no agreement reached on the
                        subject. The discussion seems premature until the powers have agreed whether
                        they will limit their demands to 450,000,000 taels to the 1st of July. So
                        far, the only powers which have formally agreed to this are Great Britain,
                        Germany, Belgium, Holland, and Italy. I reserve to announce our acceptance
                        of it until all the other representatives have done so.</p>

                        <head><hi rend="italic">Committee on the payment of indemnities.</hi></head>
                        <p>His Excellency Li Hung-chang, assisted by Messrs. Hsu Shou-peng and Na
                            Tung, are present at the meeting.</p>
                        <p>Mr. von Mumm explained to His Excellency Li Hung-chang that the committee
                            has consented with pleasure to his desire to give it explanation on the
                            letter by which the Chinese plenipotentiaries have declared that the
                            Chinese Government accepted to pay interest at 4 per cent on the capital
                            of the indemnity. The committee is not acting at the present moment in
                            virtue of any instructions from the diplomatic corps, but in its
                            personal capacity. It has as its only object to secure information on
                            certain passages in the letter referred to, and which seemed to it
                            obscure. It would particulary like to know how the Chinese
                            plenipotentiaries understand the system of amortization which they
                            proposed.</p>
                        <p>His Excellency Li Hung-chang: We propose to pay in the first place the
                            capital in twenty years, then the interest in twenty years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. von Mumm: This system would cause a loss to the powers, since it does
                            not take into account compound interest; that is to say, interest on the
                            interests, the payment of which is deferred. For if we accept
                            provisionally the figure of 450,000,000 taels as the total of the
                            idemnities, the annual interest at 4 per cent would be 18,000,000. If
                            China only pays 15,000,000 for the first year, there remains 3,000,000,
                            the payment of which is deferred, and which consequently would also bear
                            4 per cent interest from the following year. At the beginning of the
                            second year China would owe, therefore, 453,000,000 taels as capital,
                            and so on and so on.</p>
                        <p>His Excellency Li Hung-chang: Could not a portion of the 15,000,000 be
                            devoted to the payment of the capital and the other to the payment of
                            the interests?</p>
                        <p>Mr. von Mumm: That is not possible, since the sum of 15,000,000 taels is
                            lower than the amount of the interests, which are 18,000,000 taels.</p>
                        <p>His Excellency Li Hung-chang: My proposal is therefore impossible to
                            apply, and some other system must necessarily be adopted to satisfy the
                            powers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. von Mumm: The committee, speaking always for itself, and without
                            instructions from the diplomatic corps, is of opinion that the system
                            already in force as regards the old loans should be applied to this new
                            one. In paying a sum slightly in excess of the interest, the
                            amortization could go on. Nevertheless, China experiencing difficulties
                            to supply new resources, we have worked out a combination which does not
                            impose new charges on the budget of the Empire in excess of a
                            supplementary sum equal in amount to the interests—that is to say,
                            18,000,000 taels. For the amortization we use the credit balance of the
                            revenues actually devoted to the old loans, and which will begin from
                            the year 1906, and will increase after that in 1916 and in 1932. China
                            supplying annually 18,000,000 taels more than what she is paying at the
                            present for the interest on her old loans, this sum would be devoted,
                            until 1905, to the payment of interest exclusively. In 1906 a balance
                            becomes available every year of the revenues actually controlled by the
                            customs and terms of the amortization to begin to operate. This balance
                            increases appreciably from the years 1916 and 1932, and at the same time
                            the amount of interests decrease through the gradual extinction of the
                            capital. Consequently the amortization can be carried out more and more
                            rapidly and be <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0194"/>determined in
                            forty-five years. During that period the burdens of China remain
                            approximately the same, and only exceed by 18,000,000 taels as a maximum
                            the annuities paid at the present day.</p>
                        <p>His Excellency Li Hung-chang hands in a table of amortization drawn up
                            according to the system which he has explained, and observes that the
                            Government being in a difficult financial situation, proposes that the
                            powers shall take into account its poverty.</p>
                        <p>Mr. von Mumm remarks that this plan is different from that which was
                            adopted for the old loans, and expresses the opinion that it would be
                            preferable to make no innovations. On the demand of His Excellency Li
                            Hung-chang he promises to send him a table of amortization drawn up in
                            accordance with the systems which he has mentioned. He insists on the
                            fact that this communication has no official character, and is only
                            given as a simple information. The committee has not the power to
                            propose or accept anything.</p>
                        <p>Mr. von Mumm adds that the powers have taken into consideration the
                            financial embarrassment of the Chinese Government, since they do not
                            insist on a higher rate of interest than 4 per cent. This is a rate much
                            inferior to the one which China expected, or which she would have had to
                            pay to the bankers if she had been obliged to make a loan directly.</p>
                        <p>His Excellency Li Hung-chang: Mr. Jamieson, in conversations which he has
                            had with the Viceroys Chang Chih-tung and Liu Kun-yi, had promised them
                            that this rate would not exceed 3½ per cent. Sir Ernest Satow declared
                            that this is an invention of the viceroys. Mr. Jamieson promised
                            nothing. Chang Chih-tung made an inquiry of him.</p>
                        <p>His Excellency Li Hung-chang declares that the Chinese Government accepts
                            with pleasure to pay 4 per cent, asking only that the annuities shall be
                            proportionate to its resources. He has confidence in the representatives
                            of the powers to help him to get out of his troubles.</p>
                        <p>Sir Ernest Satow: The losses and expenses demanded by the Governments
                            have been calculated in gold, according to the currency of each
                            Government, but for the convenience of the Chinese plenipotentiaries the
                            sums have been transferred into taels. It is self-evident, nevertheless,
                            that later on when the Governments will officially present to China the
                            amount of the claims the latter will be calculated in gold and that the
                            interests will be in gold and not in taels.</p>
                        <p>His Excellency Li Hung-chang makes no objections. The present loans are
                            for the most part calculated in gold. The Maritime Customs will be
                            intrusted by China with the payment of the annuities to the powers, the
                            latter dividing them up among themselves.</p>
                        <p>Mr. von Mumm: The Chinese plenipotentiaries propose to us to organize a
                            committee of bankers charged with receiving the sums and dividing them
                            up.</p>
                        <p>Sir Ernest Satow: The Maritime Customs would pay each month to the
                            committee of bankers the fixed sum, and this latter would divide it up
                            among those entitled to it.</p>
                        <p>His Excellency Li Hung-chang: The Maritime Customs will be intrusted with
                            demanding the amount of the payments from the ministry of finance.</p>
                        <p>Sir Ernest Satow: Yes; and it would pay them into the committee of
                            financial representatives of the powers.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a question, Where would China take the 20,000,000 taels that
                            she proposes to pay annually, according to the plan of amortization
                            submitted by the Chinese plenipotentiaries, His Excellency declares that
                            besides the 15,000,000 taels which China has already offered she could
                            well dispose of 4,000,000 taels, the product of economies to be realized
                            on the tribute rice, in substituting the payment of an allowance in
                            money for a distribution of rice, and of 3,000,000 taels more on the
                            receipts of the chief likins; in all, 22,000,000 taels.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Komura having asked if in the case where the powers would accept an
                            increase of the import duties to 10 per cent China would agree to
                            abolish likin taxes on importations, His Excellency Li Hung-chang
                            replied that his Government could do away with a part of the likins.</p>
                        <p>The meeting came to an end at half past 11.</p>

                            the powers have taken, as regards the modifications to he introduced in
                            the Court ceremonial, the following resolutions, of which they ask the
                            execution, in conformity with article 12 of the Joint Note:</p>
                        <p>Solemn audiences given by the Emperor to the diplomatic corps shall take
                            place in the T’ai-ho Tien; those which shall be given to one of the
                            representatives of the powers shall take place in the Chien-ching
                            Kung.</p>
                        <p>When the diplomatic agent shall present his letters of credence, or a
                            communication from the Chief of the State by whom he is credited, the
                            Emperor shall send an Imperial sedan chair, which shall take him at his
                            residence and conduct him with his suite to the palace, where he shall
                            be received. He shall be reconducted with the same ceremony.</p>
                        <p>In going to these audiences the diplomatic agent shall pass through the
                            central doors (or gates) until he has handed in his letters of credence
                            or communication. In returning he shall conform to the usages already
                            established.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor shall receive directly into his hands the letters or
                            communications which the diplomatic agents shall have to give him.</p>
                        <p>In going to solemn audiences the representatives of the powers shall be
                            carried in their chairs before the hall in which they shall be received
                            by the Emperor. They shall take their chairs again at the place at which
                            they shall have left them.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor shall assist in person at the banquets which he may offer to
                            the diplomatic corps, as was done yearly before the events of last year,
                            and these banquets shall take place in the Chien-ching Kung.</p>
                        <p>In a general way my colleagues declare that the Court ceremony concerning
                            their receptions shall comply with the usages established between
                            independent and equal nations, and they ask that the details entering
                            into the settlement of this question, of which they confine themselves
                            in indicating here the more general provisions, shall be incorporated in
                            a protocol drawn up between them and the plenipotentiaries of the
                            Imperial Government.</p>
                        <p>I beg your highness and your excellency to be pleased to ask the Emperor
                            to order the measures which the execution of these resolutions
                            necessitate.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: On the 10th of April we had
                            the honor to receive a communication from your excellency in which you
                            submitted the conclusion arrived at by the foreign representatives in
                            regard to the ceremonial’ to be observed at audiences of His Majesty the
                            Emperor.</p>
                        <p>Though the ceremonial is in accordance with the form prevailing in
                            European countries and the United States, still there are certain points
                            which we find it difficult to comply with. They are four in number,
                            which we would submit for the consideration of the foreign
                            representatives:</p>
                        <p>1. As to general audiences being held in the T’ai-ho Tien, we would point
                            out that this throne hall is used by the Emperor, who ascends the Throne
                            on the <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0196"/>occasion of great
                            celebrations and when his majesty receives New Year’s congratulations.
                            When the Emperor ascends the throne the insignia carried before the
                            Emperor, the Emperor’s traveling equipage or escort, the whip which is
                            cracked, and the band of music, must be arranged in due order. The
                            princes, dukes, and civil and military officers are assigned places in
                            the courtyard where the stones are marking their rank. The rules are
                            very strict and not the least disorder will be allowed.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor must appear in full court dress, and the forms of etiquette
                            are multifarious. It is therefore very inconvenient to hold audiences
                            granted to foreign representatives there. If a change is made and
                            audiences held in another hall this would seem to be more suitable.</p>
                        <p>2. In the matter of the foreign representative presenting his letters of
                            credence, or a letter from the head of his State, on which occasion an
                            Imperial sedan chair should be sent for them, we would state that it is
                            not convenient to send the chair the Emperor rides in. The Imperial
                            household naturally should prepare a sedan chair, such as is used by the
                            high officials of the first rank, to be sent for the minister; this
                            would be in accordance with the rules of state. There is practically no
                            difference in the above system to that prevailing in European
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>3. As to the question that the foreign representatives should be taken to
                            the steps Of the audience hall and should be taken back therefrom, we
                            would observe that heretofore princes, dukes, and ministers of state, on
                            going to the forbidden city, alight from their chairs outside of the
                            Tung Hua gate and the Hsi Hua gate, as the case may be. An exception,
                            however, has been made by special decree in the case of Prince Kung, the
                            uncle of the Emperor, and Prince Chun, the father of the Emperor, who
                            are permitted to take their chairs to the Ching Yun gate on the east
                            side and to the Lung Tsung gate on the west side. In European countries
                            the foreign representatives take carriages, but they are not allowed to
                            go to the front of the steps of the audience hall. It appears that there
                            is no distinction made in this rule. The question should receive further
                            consideration and changes made.</p>
                        <p>4. As to the question that if banquets are given, as have been done in
                            previous years, these should take place in the Chien-ching Kung and the
                            Emperor assist in person, we may observe that the ceremonial at banquets
                            given by sovereigns of foreign countries to diplomatic representatives
                            is not the same. That banquets should be given in the Chien-ching Kung
                            and the Emperor assist in person is still a trivial matter, and changes
                            can be made by way of accommodation or compromise; but as to banquets
                            being given, this is a matter optional (with the Emperor), and one that
                            can await further discussion.</p>
                        <p>The above we present as being our views for your excellency’s further
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>In a word, no matter what form of courtesy China shows to the foreign
                            representatives, on no account will it be other than on a footing of
                            equality between the two countries concerned without loss of
                            prestige.</p>
                        <p>In sending this communication to your excellency, as dean of the
                            diplomatic corps, we beg that you will confer with your colleagues and
                            favor us with a reply.</p>

                            had the honor to receive your communication in reply to the one which I
                            had sent you on the 18th to communicate to you the views of my
                            colleagues concerning the modifications of the Court ceremonial
                            concerning the reception of foreign representatives by His Majesty the
                            Emperor.</p>
                        <p>My colleagues request me to inform you, in reply to your letter, that the
                            hall in the Imperial Palace called Chien-ching Kung, which they had
                            indicated as the most appropriate for the audiences of separate foreign
                            representatives of His Majesty, being also suitable for audiences given
                            to the whole diplomatic corps, they modify the demand transmitted in my
                            letter of the 18th of April in that sense. The Chien-ching Kung shall be
                            the hall in which all solemn audiences given by His Majesty the Emperor
                            to the representatives of the powers, either individually or
                            collectively, shall take place.</p>
                        <p>As to the Imperial sedan chair which is to be sent to the residence of a
                            foreign representative for the presentation of his letters of credence
                            or a communication <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0197"/>from the
                            Chief of the State by which he is accredited, my colleagues understand
                            by that that it shall be a sedan chair of the Imperial color, similar to
                            those used by His Majesty.</p>
                        <p>The explanations which you have given concerning the spot where the
                            foreign ministers should leave and get back into their sedan chairs when
                            they shall be admitted to Imperial audiences have not appeared
                            satisfactory to my colleagues, who insist in this connection, and under
                            reserve of the modification accepted by them in the selection of the
                            hall, on the right which they have demanded. In consequence they will
                            alight and get back into their sedan chairs at the foot of the steps
                            leading up to the hall.</p>
                        <p>As regards the banquets which His Majesty the Emperor may give to the
                            representatives of the powers, my colleagues request me to inform you
                            that the only bearing of their demand is to prevent that henceforth the
                            Emperor should invite them in another building than one of those in the
                            Imperial palace and that he should be represented by someone else at the
                            banquets offered by him and in his name. But it never entered into their
                            minds to make it obligatory for the Emperor to address to the diplomatic
                            agents invitations to dinner.</p>
                        <p>I avail myself of this opportunity, etc.,</p>

                            honor to receive your excellency’s communication in reply, having
                            reference to the audience ceremonial.</p>
                        <p>We have given this matter our careful consideration, and we find that it
                            is absolutely necessary for us to again present our views in support of
                            the position we take.</p>
                        <p>As to the color of the chair, we may state that in China the Emperor is
                            the only personage using the sedan chair covered with yellow. The
                            Princes, Dukes, and Ministers of State all use chairs covered with green
                            cloth.</p>

                            covered with green cloth should be provided and sent to take him. This
                            would fully show honor and dignity to his rank. To ride in a yellow
                            chair would appear as though the personage in it was the Emperor
                            himself. On hearing this the people would naturally become astonished,
                            and it would also be inconvenient for us to present your excellency’s
                            communication in a memorial to the Throne. In a previous communication
                            we explained our views re the question of the place where the foreign
                            representatives should alight and take their chairs.</p>
                        <p>Under the system hitherto prevailing in China, Princes, Dukes, and
                            Ministers of State alight from their chairs outside of the Tung Hua
                            gate; but as to the chairs the Emperor grants them for use in the
                            Forbidden City, these are in the shape of small chairs which they can
                            ride in to the Ching Yun gate.</p>
                        <p>In the communication (under acknowledgment) it states that on an audience
                            being given to a single representative or to the diplomatic corps, these
                            should be given in the Chien-ching Kung.</p>
                        <p>We would observe that to enter the audience hall in question it is
                            necessary to take the road by way of the Ching Yun gate. Then
                            conformably to the rule existing in regard to the chairs granted to
                            Princes, Dukes, and Ministers of State, going into the Forbidden City,
                            these are taken after entering the Tung Hua gate. The chairs are called
                                <hi rend="italic">i chiao</hi>. This would be more in accordance
                            with what is befitting. The foreign representatives alighting from and
                            taking their chairs in front of the steps of the Chien-ching Kung would
                            not be suitable, and it would be a matter difficult to agree to.</p>
                        <p>We have the honor, therefore, to request your excellency to be good
                            enough to satisfactorily arrange this matter with your colleagues and
                            favor us with a reply.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my dispatch No. 54, of April 2 last, I
                        informed you that the representatives of the powers, with the exception of
                        the minister of Russia, had transmitted to the Chinese plenipotentiaries a
                        list of provincial officials and others guilty of crimes committed against
                        foreigners during the troubles of last year, for whom they demanded certain
                        specific punishments.</p>
                    <p>The penalties to be inflicted on the officials, as originally decided upon by
                        the foreign representatives, included 10 capital sentences and 86 others of
                        various degrees of severity.</p>
                    <p>Under the influence of the President’s instructions to me to oppose the
                        shedding of any more blood and to urge moderation, the capital demands were
                        reduced to 4, and various reductions were agreed to in the other
                        penalties.</p>
                    <p>Since this list was communicated to the Chinese plenipotentiaries (see
                        inclosure 1 and list annexed) some of the foreign ministers have received
                        information from their nationals in the interior exculpating certain of the
                        persons whose names were borne on the list, and the Chinese Government has
                        also adduced proof of the innocence of others, or has shown that they were
                        not as guilty as at first supposed. These facts are all set forth in the
                        inclosed copies of correspondence and in the notes I have made on the list
                        accompanying the communication of the ministers to the Chinese
                        plenipotentiaries of April 1.</p>
                    <p>The Imperial decree of April 29 (inclosure No. 8) orders the decapitation of
                        3 of the most guilty officials and an investigation of the case of a fourth,
                        the death sentence to be promptly carried out if the charges made are proven
                        to be true. The same decree awards punishment to 48 other persons.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Hu Tê-hsiu (No. 25), information having been furnished me
                        within the last few days, by Mr. Atwood, an American missionary at Tai-ku
                        Hsien, that this official was in all probablility innocent of the crimes
                        charged to him, I have requested the Chinese plenipotentiaries to ask that
                        the punishment awarded him be suspended and a careful inquiry made to
                        determine on whom must rest the responsibility for the failure to protect
                        our countrymen residing in this place, which resulted in their murder on
                        July 31 of last year.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Hu Ching-kuei (No. 94), ex-provincial judge of the province of
                        Shantung, I asked that an inquest be first made by the Chinese authorities,
                        as I was assured by the governor of the province, Yuan Shih-k’ai, an old
                        personal friend of mine and an official of great merit, that the charges
                        against the accused lacked proof. This has also been agreed to by the
                        foreign representatives.</p>
                    <p>It seems probable that some of the cases now under investigation by the
                        Chinese will result in convictions, but I fancy that a number of them will
                        ultimately be dropped, with the exception, perhaps, of the names mentioned
                        in the letter of the representatives to the Chinese plenipotentiaries of May
                        17 (inclosure No. 11).</p>
                    <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0199"/>
                    <p>I have not deemed it necessary to send yon the second list of suspected
                        officials mentioned in the plenipotentiaries’ note of April 1. The Chinese
                        Government is inquiring into these cases, and it is possible that some
                        punishments may ensue, but they will not be in any case, I imagine, of great
                        severity.</p>

                            5th of February with the representatives of the powers, that the names
                            of the officials guilty of crimes committed in the provinces would be

                            inflicted on these functionaries, in conformity with article II of the

                        <p>The undersigned plenipotentiaries have in consequence to communicate to

                                <item>First. A list of the officials whose guiltiness they consider
                                    established, and for whom they indicate the punishments to be

                                    information, they ask that an inquest be made by the Chinese
                                        Government.<note n="1" xml:id="d130fn1">List

                            request, without delay, from the Throne, so as to finally settle this
                            question, decrees in conformity with the demand which they transmit to
                            you. They hold that without waiting for the results of the inquest to be
                            held by the Chinese Government, as rapidly as possible it would be
                            proper to have posted throughout the Empire, and in compliance with
                            Article X of the joint note, edicts mentioning the punishments which
                            they announced. This will permit of satisfaction being given more

                            examination of which was deferred until articles II and X of the Joint

                            responsibility for the assassination of Mgr. Fantosati and Father
                            Gambaro. They refused to protect them, and they must be held as
                            accomplices of the taotai. Yu Ching published incendiary proclamations
                            which led to the destruction of Protestant chapels. Degradation;

                        <p>61. Pao Tsu-ling, taotai of Ch’ü-chou, known for his hatred of
                            foreigners, encouraged the train bands and the rioters to massacre the
                            foreigners at Ch’ü-chou Fu (21st, 22d, and 23d July). It would have been
                            easy for him to have protected them, but he allowed, before the gate of
                            his yamen, Mr. and Mrs. Thompson and their two children, Miss Desmond,
                            Miss Sherwood, and Miss Manchester to be insulted and murdered. When
                            informing the governor of these murders he praised the train bands for
                            the patriotic spirit they had shown. Death sentence.</p>
                        <p>62. Chou Chih-tē, commander of the town guard of Ch’ü-chou, took an
                            active part in the massacre of foreigners. Not only did he plan the
                            attack on the missionaries, but he led in person the rioters.

                        <p>63. Liu Shu-t’ang, former governor of Che-kiang, published a secret edict
                            ordering the murder of foreigners. He is likewise responsible for the
                            massacre at Ch’ü-chou. Although he later on withdrew this edict, the
                            massacres began at once. He remained at his post as governor for four
                            months thereafter, and he took no action against the murderers. He
                            should have suspended from duty the principal officials of the city.

                            which took place on the 21st July at the gate of the yamen. He had 5,000
                            soldiers under his command, and the fact of his not having tried to put
                            down the uprising, which ended in a massacre, proves that these crimes
                            were committed with his consent. Degradation; exile for life.</p>

                            foreign representatives, asking them to consider it, and agree to a more
                            lenient form of punishment being meted out to these officers, and favor
                            us with a reply.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Highness, Excellency</hi>: We have the honor to
                            acknowledge receipt of your letter dated yesterday, in which you request
                            us to grant a reduction in the punishment which we proposed for the
                            ex-governor and the provincial judge of Chekiang, whose names figure in
                            the list of guilty provincial officials.</p>
                        <p>In reply to this communication we deem it proper to note that Liu
                            Shu-t’ang and Yung-ch’uan have been acknowledged guilty of complicity in
                            the murder of missionaries committed at Chu Chou. The first accused, he
                            who played the chief role in the assassination, was the Taotai Pao, who
                            mercilessly closed his door to missionaries whose murder took place
                            outside it.</p>
                        <p>But the first responsibility for the crime must, without doubt, be thrown
                            on the governor of the province. The taotai acted in accordance with an
                            imperial decree, which was published by Liu Shu-t’ang, with the active
                            assistance of Yung Ch’uan.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that these officials caused the movement which
                            resulted in the villainous murder of missionaries, they deserve the
                            severest punishment, without the benefit of extenuating
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>In view of the remoteness of the court, they might without danger, as did
                            other high provincial officials animated by feelings of humanity, have
                            treated the decree as an act of folly.</p>
                        <p>Under these conditions the penalty proposed can not be regarded as
                            disproportionate to their crime. Nevertheless, taking into consideration
                            the age of Liu Shu-tang, who is 70 years old, and the request which your
                            highness and your excellency have presented for him, we consent, as a
                            special act of grace, to the commutation of the original penalty into
                            one removing definitely Liu Shu-tang from the public service with
                            confiscation of his property, and that he be sent back to his country,
                            where he shall be strictly placed under the supervision of the local
                            authorities. In the case of Yung Ch’uan, extenuating circumstances can
                            not be allowed, and the undersigned representatives of the powers insist
                            that his sentence be carried out.</p>
                        <p>(Signed by all the foreign representatives except the minister of
                            Russia.)</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellencies</hi>: On the 1st of April we had
                            the honor to receive a communication from the foreign representatives,
                            inclosing two lists—one giving the names of officials in the provinces
                            who should be punished and the other giving <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200"
                                facs="0206"/>the names of officials in the provinces whose conduct
                            should be subject to an investigation.</p>
                        <p>We duly submitted these lists in a telegraphic memorial to the Throne,
                            requesting that an imperial decree be issued in regard thereto.</p>
                        <p>On the 16th of April we received a telegram from the Grand Council,
                            stating that “The lists submitted regarding the punishments of the
                            provincial officials had been presented to the throne, and that a verbal
                            decree had been issued to effect that some of the persons whose names
                            are proposed for punishment should be made the subject of further
                            discussion. Article 10 of the Joint Note strictly defines that
                            punishment shall be inflicted on officials hereafter for failure to
                            protect (foreigners). But it is not convenient in cases occurring
                            previous to the signing of the convention affecting missions in the
                            provinces, where the local authorities did not give full and adequate
                            protection, but where no lives were taken, and where they did not screen
                            or protect the Boxers, that the officers should be forever prohibited
                            from holding any office or honors.</p>
                        <p>“In a previous telegram the Prince of Talat is proposed (for punishment),
                            but his case must still receive further inquiry and action taken
                            accordingly. It is not convenient to imprison him.</p>
                        <p>“It is proposed to degrade Governor Liu Shu-fang, and send him to his
                            native place. It is not convenient, however, to confiscate his
                            property.</p>
                        <p>“As to the case of Yen Chin, transferred as provincial judge of Shansi,
                            it is stated that he treated foreigners with contempt; general
                            instructions were issued to various officials to investigate the matter,
                            but no absolute proof of the charge has been found against him.
                            Telegraphic instructions were also issued to various officials to
                            investigate the charge, but the reports received are that nothing of the
                            kind occurred.</p>
                        <p>“As to the provincial judge of Shantung, Hu Ching-kuei, the charges
                            against him are mere empty words. In Shantung the authorities exercised
                            every means to protect the missionaries and exterminate the Boxers. The
                            judge was at the time at the capital, and he was quite unable alone to
                            treat foreigners with contempt and screen the Boxers. Further, the said
                            judge issued proclamations prohibiting the practice of the Boxer antics.
                            This can be inquired into. It is requested, therefore, that these
                            officials (the above two) may be acquitted.</p>
                        <p>“In the case of Kuei Cheng, deputy lieutenant-general, it may be observed
                            that in regard to the missionary case at Kuei-hua Ch’eng the
                            lieutenant-general had control of affairs, but the Kuei Sui taotai,
                            Cheng Wen-chin, managed the case in question. Although Kuei Cheng was
                            there, still he could not prevent (what happened), and his punishment
                            should be reduced.</p>
                        <p>“As to the case of the taotai of Ho-pei, Ts’en Chuan-jung, at the time he
                            issued a proclamation in which it was stated that those who desired to
                            practice the Boxer antics must first make application to the local
                            officials for permission to do so. The idea of issuing the proclamation
                            was for the purpose of using it as a means of investigating and
                            prohibiting the practice. It was issued at the time of a crisis and
                            revolution, and the taotai could not but adopt a temporary arrangement
                            to meet pressing circumstances. It was a measure of expediency. His case
                            is not one where missionaries or native Christians were massacred, and
                            it might he as well to reduce his punishment.</p>
                        <p>“In the missionary cases in Szechuan the taotai and prefect of
                            Chien-chang did not exert themselves in giving due protection, but there
                            were no lives of missionaries taken. It is right that the punishment
                            that should be meted out to them should be lighter than that of the
                            department and district officials (in the same province).</p>
                        <p>“As to the prefect of Chu Chou, Huang Ssu-liang, this officer did not
                            assist in the murder of the missionaries. He was merely connected with
                            the taotai’s yamen. He should be treated leniently.</p>
                        <p>“In the matter of the other local officials of the provinces, they merely
                            treated the missionaries harshly and did not exert themselves in
                            protecting them on their journey. It is right, therefore, that the
                            circumstances of each case should be clearly ascertained and light and
                            heavy punishment be meted out accordingly. It is not convenient to
                            punish them all by forever prohibiting them from holding any office or
                            honors. We beg you to take up this matter and discuss it earnestly (with
                            the foreign representatives), in the hope that these officers may be
                            justly treated and protected.</p>
                        <p>“There are 50 officers whose punishment, according to the list, is very
                            heavy. Of this number there are 9 whose names it is necessary to
                            ascertain. We now speedily telegraph you in regard to this matter, and
                            hope you will consider it and lose no time in sending a reply by wire,
                            to the end that we may memorialize the Throne and ask for a decree.</p>
                        <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0207"/>
                        <p>“Of the 17 officials whose names should be ascertained, you should
                            discuss with the foreign representatives the question of a lighter form
                            of punishment being meted out to them.</p>
                        <p>“The viceroys and governors concerned have been ordered to investigate
                            without delay the cases of the 23 officials (excepting Governors Yu and
                            Sung) whose names appear on the list. On their presenting their reports
                            the Throne will be asked to issue a decree punishing them according as
                            their respective crimes deserve.</p>
                        <p>“As to the deputy lieutenant-generals of Mukden, Tsitsihar, and Hu Lan,
                            and the military commandant of Pa-yen su-su, these should also have
                            their punishments reduced.”</p>
                        <p>From the above telegram we would observe that there are four matters to
                            be considered with the foreign representatives, viz: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>

                                    suggested, less 9 whose names are to be ascertained, as proposed
                                    by the foreign representatives, their cases being comparatively

                                    away, however, with the words “forever prohibited from holding
                                    any office or honor?”</item>
                                <label>4.</label>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: We have the honor to inform
                            your excellency that on the 18th of May we received a telegraphic decree
                            from Si-an as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Yu Yin-lin, on the 18th of April, memorialized us by telegram, stating
                            that in regard to the missionary cases in Ho-pei (Ho-nan) the taotai,
                            Feng Kuang-yuan, and the French bishop, Scarella, had consulted
                            together, and it was agreed that 170,000 taels should be paid as
                            indemnity, covering all the claims of the missionaries. Further, 3,000
                            piculs of rice are to be given to relieve the native Christians. As to
                            the principal criminals in the murder cases in Wu-an, separate
                            instructions had been issued (to the officials concerned) to take
                            strenuous measures to effect their arrest. In the other cases of riot
                            and disorder the guilty persons, estimated from 10 to 15, have been
                            arrested, some of them put in the cangue and bam booed, and others
                            confined in chains, receiving a light or heavy punishment, as their
                            offenses deserved. All the missionaries have returned to their
                            respective districts, the local officials supplying funds to enable them
                            to rent houses for temporary occupation. Extra care has been taken to
                            protect them, and soldiers deputed to preserve order. Bishop Scarella
                            has explained matters concerning Shih Keng, magistrate of An-yang, who
                            exerted himself in protecting the missionaries. The bishop also reports
                            that the acting magistrate of the Hua district, Lu Yueh-ching, is a very
                            good officer and was diligent in arresting outlaws; that the magistrate
                            of Wu-an, Chen Shih-wei, collected money and repaired the graves of the
                            missionaries. He also gave 11,200 taels for renting houses and providing
                            relief and 200 piculs of rice. The magistrate of the She district, Che
                            Chun, contributed for the purchase of houses 2,000 taels. He also gave
                            200 piculs of rice and 200 taels for miscellaneous expenses. Bishop
                            Scarella stated distinctly that he wished the above officials acquitted.
                            In the case of the Ho-pei taotai, Ts’en Chuan-yung, as he did not
                            perform his duties properly, the bishop requested that he should be
                            degraded. <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0208"/>Of the indemnity,
                            50,000 taels have been paid on account and a limited time is given to
                            pay the balance of the installments. Bishop Scarella has agreed to the
                            settlement of the various cases and signed an agreement to that effect,
                            so they are now all closed. A petition will be sent by the bishop to the
                            French minister for his information. These cases have now been arranged
                            and settled by the deputies of Honan, in conjunction with Bishop
                            Scarella, and duly signed. As to the request that Ts’en Chuan-yung be
                            degraded and the other officials be acquitted, it is right that action
                            be taken accordingly.</p>
                        <p>“Let the foreign representatives be at once informed of this and a
                            telegraphic reply sent to us.”</p>
                        <p>We would observe that it appears that the four officers, viz, Shih Keng,
                            of the An-yang district; Lu Yueh-ching, acting magistrate of the Hua
                            district; Ghen Shih-wei, magistrate of Wu-an, and Che Chun, magistrate
                            of the She district, have contributed money in way of indemnity, also
                            rice; have rented houses and protected missionaries. According to the
                            statement of Bishop Scarella, these officers have performed their duties
                            well, and did not fail to exert themselves in giving due protection. It
                            is therefore requested that they be acquitted. In the case of the taotai
                            of Ho-pei, Ts’en Chuan-jung, he did not perform his official duties
                            properly, and it is requested that he be degraded. The governor of Honan
                            has already memorialized the Throne by telegraph, asking his
                            degradation, and a decree issued agreeing to this request. It is
                            believed that the French minister must have received Bishop Scarella’s
                            telegram informing him of what had been done.</p>
                        <p>As in duty bound, we send this communication for the information of your
                            excellency, and ask you, after you have made special inquiry (of the
                            French minister about this matter), to favor us with a reply.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Highness and Your Excellency</hi>: In reply to
                            your dispatch of 17th of April concerning the punishments to be
                            inflicted, in conformity with our demands, on the officials guilty of
                            crimes committed in the provinces, we have the honor to transmit to you
                            herewith the following resolutions:</p>
                        <p>It is impossible for us to admit that the officials responsible for
                            massacres or cruel treatment of which foreigners have been victims last
                            year shall aspire in the present or in the future to new functions after
                            having been punished with great indulgence for the crimes for which they
                            are responsible. We consequently insist that the officials who shall be
                            degraded shall in no case become again functionaries of the Empire.</p>
                        <p>The King of Talat can not be pardoned, having been responsible for the
                            massacre of more than 800 persons. We consented in our letter of the 4th
                            of April to a reduction of the punishment of Liu Shu-tang (63), and we
                            can not accept a punishment lighter than the one we have indicated. We
                            consent to an inquest concerning the charges made against Yen Chih (79)
                            and Hu Ching-kuei (94); we consent to the degradation for life, without
                            exile or Imprisonment, for Kuei Cheng (22); we consider Chen Chuan-jung
                            (85) as too guilty to deserve any reduction of his punishment; we
                            consent to a reduction in the punishment of the taotais (70, 71) and of
                            the prefect (70) of Chien-chang. We must insist on our demand concerning
                            Hung Tzu-liang (66), former prefect of Chin Chou; we consent to a
                            reduction in the punishment of Governor Yu (57) and to the omission of
                            the name of Governor Sung (91); we can accept no reduction of any kind
                            in the punishment of the three military lieutenant-governors of Mukden
                            (5), of Hei-lung Chiang (54), and of Hu lu (55) and of the Tartar
                            commander of Payen-su-su (56).</p>
                        <p>We take note of the fact that you agree to the punishments which we have
                            asked for 50 officials, 9 of whom are to be identified, and we accept
                            your proposition that you should ask at the present moment a decree in
                            this sense. With the reservation made at the commencement of this letter
                            concerning officials for whom we insist on the original demand of
                            punishments made, we accept the inquest and the ulterior discussion
                            which you promise us for those for whom you make a request for reduction
                            of punishment. We can not accept the suppression of the words “without
                            it being possible to ever recall them to new functions,” which would
                            apply to degraded officials. We request you to ask, without any delay,
                            of the Throne an edict in conformity with our propositions, containing
                            mention of <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0209"/>all the punishments
                            and of those which you have inflicted, and announcing the inquests for
                            the officials who shall be subjected to this formality.</p>
                        <p>Please accept, your highness and your excellency, the assurances of our
                            very high consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: On the 1st of April I received
                            a communication from the foreign representatives submitting a list of
                            officials in the provinces which they desired punished. In this list
                            appears the name of Li Chao-chen, magistrate of the Wang-tu district,
                            who is charged with having treated harshly certain British missionaries
                            who were fleeing from the difficult position they were in. It is
                            requested that this officer should be degraded and forever prohibited
                            from holding any office or honor.</p>
                        <p>Instructions were issued informing this officer of the charge, and I
                            received in reply a joint petition from the taotai of Kou-pei and the
                            prefect of Hsuan-hua in the following sense: “It appears that the said
                            officer has been away from his post at Wang-tu for a period of three
                            years. While holding office at Yu-chou there was a sudden rising of the
                            “Boxer” bandits, and the principal leaders, Chia Chi and others—in all,
                            seven persons—were arrested and decapitated. Full and adequate
                            protection was afforded the missionaries at Hsi-ho Ying. The preacher,
                            Tung Shou-i, even up to the present time, expresses his gratitude for
                            what the magistrate had done. The magistrate was transferred as acting
                            magistrate of the Hsuan-hua district. He treated the allied forces,
                            comprising Germans, British, Italians, and Austrians, kindly, and looked
                            after their wants in every respect. The native Christians of Hu-to Tien
                            and the train band of Shen-ching Pao entertained suspicions which led to
                            a feud, each of the parties using guns and cannon in the fray, which
                            nearly resulted in a revolution. The magistrate went in person to the
                            scene to explain and relieve the feelings of the combatants, which
                            resulted in bringing about peace and quiet among them. The preacher Te
                            Mou-chen stated that the magistrate had rendered very great assistance
                            in managing the missionary cases of 13 subprefectures, departments, and
                            districts in the jurisdiction of Hsuan-hua. The preacher Hou Chen-hai
                            said that he would gratefully remember the magistrate’s great kindness.
                            The above statements can be supported by proof. It is not right, in the
                            case of the British missionaries being harshly treated in Wang-tu, when
                            fleeing, that by mistake the officer holding the substantive
                            appointment, but at the time was away from his post, should be falsely
                            accused of doing an act committed by the officer who was acting as
                            magistrate. It is proper to ask the foreign representatives to
                            investigate this matter and remove Mr. Li’s name from the list of
                            punishments.”</p>
                        <p>Having received the above petition, I beg to observe that there is
                            evidently proof to support the statements made. It is a case of the
                            accused being pointed out by mistake as committing an act of an acting
                            officer, and it is right to request that his name be taken off the list
                            of punishments. Further, inquiry should be made in regard to the harsh
                            treatment of the fleeing missionaries—ascertaining the year, month, and
                            day, so that the full official title of the acting officer (at Wang-tu)
                            may be ascertained, and then he can be impeached to the Throne. This in
                            order to show justice.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor, therefore, to send your excellency a copy of the
                            original petitions, which I will trouble you to thoroughly look into and
                            favor me at your early convenience with a reply.</p>

                            vicinity, resulting in the loss of many lives. This excited suspicion in
                            the minds of the people of various provinces, which led to repeated
                            cases of destruction of mission property and the massacre of foreign
                            missionaries and native Christians.</p>
                        <p>We repeatedly issued our mandates ordering the authorities to see that
                            satisfactory protection be accorded the missionaries, but the local
                            officers failed to exert themselves in the proper discharge of their
                            duties, and on that account disorder <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204"
                                facs="0210"/>and, trouble prevailed. The offenders must, therefore,
                            necessarily be punished in propotion to their crimes.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellencies</hi>: On the 1st of May we
                            received a telegram from the members of the Grand Council at Si-an in
                            regard to the punishments proposed by the foreign representatives to be
                            inflicted on the provincial officers, in which they point out those
                            whose punishment should be reduced and made more lenient.</p>
                        <p>(32) Prince of Talat. This is a prince of the Outer Mongols, and hitherto
                            a prince of this order has never been incarcerated. His punishment
                            should be <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0211"/>reduced to depriving
                            him of his title of nobility, and his case be subject to an
                            investigation and dealt with accordingly.</p>
                        <p>(63) Liu Shu-tang, former governor of Chekiang. Under Chinese law,
                            property is confiscated in cases of criminals stealing property and
                            concealing it. The governor’s case should be modified to punishment by
                            degradation and forever prohibited from holding office; he should also
                            be sent to his native place.</p>
                        <p>In the cases of the former provincial judge of Chekiang, Yung Ch’uan
                            (64), the deputy military lieutenant-governor of Mukden, Chin Chang
                            (51), the deputy military lieutenant-governor of Hei lung chiang, Feng
                            Hsiang (54); and the military commandant at Pa-yen-su-su, Nge Ying (56),
                            it may be stated that their crimes do not come under the Chinese
                            statutes of cases where forgiveness is not shown. The punishment
                            “Forever forbidden from holding office” should be omitted in their
                            cases. A decree has already appeared in regard to these cases. The
                            foreign representatives, in asking punishment of Chinese officials,
                            naturally can not desire that it should be in violation of the statutes
                            of China.</p>
                        <p>In the case of the acting prefect of Tai-yuan, Hsi Han-tu (27), the
                            governor of Shansi, T’sen, reports that at the time Yu Hsien had planned
                            the massacre of the missionaries, the said officer was at his own post
                            as prefect of Lu-an. He had not at the time reached Tai-yuan as acting
                            prefect, and did not assist in the massacre. He should be acquitted, and
                            an examination instituted as to who the Tai-yuan prefect was at the time
                            and whether or not he took part in this cruel work.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Yang Hung-li, brigade general of Ta-tung (26), it may be
                            observed that there were missionary cases in his jurisdiction, and due
                            protection was not accorded. His punishment should be degradation, but
                            allowed to retain office.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Tseng Pei-chi (89), prefect of the Wei-hui prefecture,
                            this officer duly protected the British and French missionaries and
                            safely escorted them outside of his jurisdiction. He had nothing to do
                            with the murder of missionaries. He should be acquitted.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Fu Feng-yang (?), prefect of Nan-yang, this officer duly
                            protected the missionary chapels, and acted in good earnest in the
                            proper discharge of his duties. There is a record of the French
                            missionary, An Si Man, and the British missionary, Kung Hai-i, having
                            sent a note to the prefect thanking him for the services he had rendered
                            them. He did not maltreat the missionaries in any way and should be
                            acquitted.</p>
                        <p>In the cases of Chen Shih-wei (90), magistrate of the Wu-an district;
                            Shih K’eng (88), magistrate of the An-yang district; Ch’e Chun (87),
                            magistrate of the She district; Lu Yueh-ching (86), magistrate of the
                            Hua district, it may be observed that these officers have all paid the
                            missionaries the amounts of their losses and have arranged with Bishop
                            Scarella a settlement of the cases. The bishop has reported the matter
                            to the French minister asking that the matter be dropped. No decree has,
                            therefore, been issued in regard to the above eight officers.</p>
                        <p>We ask that your highness and your excellency lay before the foreign
                            representatives the reasons here given for a reduction in the form of
                            punishments and for acquittal, and to say that the Emperor has no
                            intention whatever of screening these officers. His Majesty’s wish is
                            that the punishment inflicted be as the crime merits; that is all.</p>
                        <p>Excepting the case of the Chien-chang taotai (71), whose punishment has
                            been reduced, as requested by the foreign representatives in a previous
                            communication, to degradation but allowed to retain office, the others
                            must await a report from the various provinces, and if there be any
                            cases in which the circumstances vary from those given, then they can be
                            subject to further consideration and action taken accordingly. In the
                            case of the Wang-tu magistrate, Li Chao-chen (49), as he was really away
                            from his post at the time, it has been agreed that he should be
                            acquitted.</p>
                        <p>As in duty bound, we send your excellencies the above telegram from Si An
                            for your consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellencies</hi>: On the 1st of May we
                            received a telegram from the Grand Council at Si-an, stating that in
                            regard to the punishment proposed for the officials in connection with
                            the missionary cases in the province of Kiang-si, the governor of that
                            province has now reported that, with the exception of the cases of Cheng
                            Chia-yu and Weng Pao-jen, which have been disposed of by decree, there
                                <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206" facs="0212"/>are the cases of the former
                            acting taotai of the Nan, Kang, Ming, intendentcy, T’u Chun men, and the
                            brigade general of Kang Nan Chen, Ho Ming-liang. It appears that last
                            year they issued proclamations protecting the missionaries, and that the
                            missionaries and converts did not charge them with refusing to put out
                            the viceroy’s proclamation or refuse to dispatch soldiers to maintain
                            order. The request is made that either nothing further be done in their
                            cases or that they be treated leniently. In the case of the prefect of
                            Chi-an, Hsu Tao-pei, it appears that he was removed from office a long
                            time ago. There is no absolute proof that he permitted the literati to
                            attack the missionary establishments. This officer has been instructed
                            to go to Chi-an and act with the present incumbent of office, arrest the
                            criminals, and arrange to pay the claim of the missionaries. In the case
                            of Jen Yu-shen, magistrate of the Fou-liang district, in which a
                            missionary chapel at the village of Ching-te was destroyed, it may be
                            observed that this officer has already been removed from office. It was
                            not his purpose, however, not to protect the mission property. In the
                            case of Wei Chu-kuei, acting magistrate of the Shang-kao district, it
                            may be stated that there is no proof on record of the burning or looting
                            of missionary property in that jurisdiction. There are, however, many
                            cases of litigation there pending between the people and Christians.
                            Again, the prefect of Lin-chiang is not named Shih; but the magistrate
                            of Ching-chiang district in this prefecture is named Shih Shou-chen. The
                            missionaries recently sent a note stating that there were a good many
                            cases at law there pending between the people and non-Christians, and in
                            consequence a deputy has been sent there to investigate them. As to the
                            other cases in which missionaries have been subjected to trouble in
                            various districts, it may be stated that Chang Wen-Ian and other
                            literati—in all, 15 persons—have been deprived of rank and office.</p>
                        <p>Again, the governor of Honan has reported as follows: Yu Kuang-ming
                            (80?), magistrate of the Ho-wei district in Honan, deputed soldiers to
                            escort missionaries out of the province. There is proof of this on
                            record. Lien Kuei (81), magistrate of the Jung-tse district, is dead. As
                            to Lin Teng-keng (83), magistrate of the district of Hsi-hua, this
                            officer dispatched official police to escort and protect the
                            missionaries. There is a record of this. In the case of Wang T’an (84),
                            assistant subprefect of Chou-chia-kou, on the missionaries reaching his
                            jurisdiction he deputed official police to escort and protect them, and
                            when there was trouble the rioters were suppressed and dispersed. There
                            is a record of this. The Ho-pei missionary case is settled, and the
                            request is made that it be not further considered.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the above officers, it is requested that a dispatch be
                            addressed to the foreign representatives asking that they consider the
                            circumstances of each case and in accord therewith either modify the
                            punishment demanded or acquit the accused as the case may be. On receipt
                            of reports <hi rend="italic">re</hi> the other officers, a telegram will
                            be sent to your highness and your excellency to await the action of the
                            Throne.</p>
                        <p>As in duty bound, we send the above for your excellencies’
                            information.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: Some time ago we had the honor
                            to receive a communication from the foreign representatives inclosing
                            two lists, one giving the names of officials in the provinces who should
                            be punished, and the other giving the names of officials whose conduct
                            should be subject to an investigation. A decree was issued punishing
                            certain officials, and we duly communicated to your excellency at
                            various times the circumstances reported in regard to the cases in the
                            provinces of Kiang-si and Ho-nan.</p>
                        <p>We have now received a telegram from the grand council at Si-an, stating
                            that a report has been received from the viceroy of Szechuan in regard
                            to the various officers in their connection with missionary cases.</p>
                        <p>The taotai of Chien-chang, Wang Li-yen (71); the prefect of Hsu Chou, Wen
                            Yuan; the prefect of Ya Chou, Li Nien-tze (74), and the former acting
                            prefect of Ya Chou, Wang Chih-tung (73), ordinarily issued particular
                            orders to their subordinate officers to protect the missionaries in
                            their several jurisdictions, and their work in this respect was done in
                            good earnest. Wang Li-yen, in particular, exerted himself in this
                            direction. But his jurisdiction covered a vast territory; the minds of
                            the people were aroused, and in some instances unexpected trouble
                            happened in certain <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0213"/>districts,
                            which could not he helped, in spite of the instructions issued; hut the
                            taotai did not purposely tolerate or allow it with his consent. There
                            are extenuating circumstances in this case. It is right that the
                            question of diminishing the punishment of the taotai of Chien-chang,
                            Wang Li-yen, and the former and present prefects of Ya Chou, Wang
                            Chih-tung, and Li Nien-tze should he considered. It is therefore
                            proposed to alter it to degradation with retention in office. In the
                            case of Wen Yuan, prefect of Hsü Chou, it is proposed to transfer him to
                            another post. In the original memorial to the Throne the name of this
                            officer is given as Wen Kuei; this was a mistake.</p>
                        <p>In the cases of the former acting magistrate of the Department of
                            Tsung-ching, Chen Chao-tang; the acting magistrate of Chung-ning, Chen
                            Ting-hsun; the former magistrate of Nan-kuo district, Yuan Yung-pin, and
                            the acting magistrate of the Ta-tsu district, Chao Sui-chih, after the
                            missionary troubles occurred these officers exerted themselves in
                            protecting the missionaries and acted energetically in effecting the
                            arrest of the rioters. Although some of the native Christians were
                            injured, no harm was done to the missionaries themselves. Excepting Chen
                            Chao-tang, who has been removed from office and left the province, it is
                            decided that the others—Chen Ting hsun, Yuan Yung-pin, and Chao
                            Sui-chih—should also be removed from office and to leave the
                            province.</p>
                        <p>As to the former acting magistrate of Chiung Chou, Li Chang-pei; the
                            former acting magistrate of Kuan district, Wang Hu; the former acting
                            magistrate of Wen Chiang district, Chou Ching-jen; the acting magistrate
                            of I Pin district, Wang Tien-chia; the former acting magistrate of the
                            Shuang Liu district, Kung Pao-lang; the acting magistrate of the Pi
                            district, Huang Shu-hsun, and the acting magistrate of Ming Shan
                            district, Lu Ting-chih,<note n="1" xml:id="d130fn9">Most of the above
                                names are on the list of suspected persons whose cases were to be
                                inquired into by the Chinese authorities. This list is not
                                published—W.W.R.</note> there is absolute proof that they did not
                            allow the bandits to insult the Christians: but in managing the
                            missionary cases these officers were either punctillious and obstinate
                            or they merely looked on and dillydallied. They are all to be degraded,
                            but retained in office. These officers have been severely punished—more
                            severe than the circumstances warrant. We (the grand council) beg that
                            you will communicate the above to the foreign representatives, clearly
                            explaining this and asking them to agree to the decision arrived at. We
                            would also observe that all above officers are in the list of officers
                            whose offenses should be subject to investigation, as their cases had
                            not originally been looked into. We hope that the foreign
                            representatives will lose no time in settling this matter and not be too
                            hard in the way of punishment.</p>
                        <p>We have also received from the Mongolian Superintendency a dispatch
                            stating that on the 3d of May the following decree, issued on the 29th
                            of April, was received by it from the Grand Secretariat:</p>
                        <p>“Last year the Boxer banditti created a state of revolution in Peking and
                            vicinity, resulting in the loss of many lives; this excited suspicion in
                            the minds of men of various provinces, which led to repeated cases of
                            the destruction of mission property and the massacre of foreign
                            missionaries and native Christians. We repeatedly issued our mandates
                            ordering the authorities to see that satisfactory protection be accorded
                            them, but the local officers failed to exert themselves in the proper
                            discharge of their duties, and on that account disorder and trouble
                            prevailed. The offenders must therefore necessarily be punished in
                            accordance with their respective crimes. Let the Prince of Talat be
                            deprived of his title of nobility, his case investigated, and action
                            taken in the premises. The Prince of Alashan and the Prince of the
                            Khalkha are hereby reprimanded.”</p>
                        <p>On investigation it appears that the Prince of Alashan-Dzassak is named
                            Tolo-tessuleng, and his pasturages are near Ning-hsia and in the
                            jurisdiction of Ning-hsia. It is right to address the military governor
                            of Ning-hsia, to have him reprimanded in accordance with the terms of
                            the Imperial decree. We have looked over the records of the Inner and
                            Outer Mongols, of their banners and names and styles of the princes, but
                            can not find any Prince of Talat or Prince of Chung Khalkha. In order to
                            carry out the terms of the decree, it is necessary to ascertain where
                            their pasturages are, whether they are princes of the first or second
                            rank, their residences, and the jurisdiction they are under. There are
                            many difficulties in translating Mongol names into Chinese, but to
                            translate the vulgar tongue into Chinese is still more perplexing.</p>
                        <p>We have the honor, therefore, to address your excellency this
                            communication, and beg that you will confer with your colleagues and
                            agree to the punishments decided upon in the cases of the Szechuan
                            officials, and ascertain the banners and names of the above-mentioned
                            Mongolian princes, and favor us with a reply.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Highness, Excellency</hi>: In reply to the demands
                            for punishments which we made you on the 4th and 22d April for the
                            officials responsible for the crimes committed in the provinces, you
                            informed us by your dispatches of the 27th April and 2d May of the
                            punishments which you had inflicted on these criminals.</p>
                        <p>We have noted that among these punishments did not figure that of
                            suspensive death, which we had demanded for the following officials: The
                            prefect of Pen Chou Fu (No. 3); the prefect of Hsin Chou (No. 4); the
                            assistant subprefects of Ho-lin-ko-ehr (No. 18); and of To-ko-to Ch’eng
                            (No. 19); the keeper of the board of punishments of Ning-yuan (No. 20);
                            the subprefect of Kuei-hua Ch’eng (No. 23); the ex-subprefect of Wu-i
                            (No. 41); the military lieutenant-governor of Mukden (No. 51); the
                            military official Ao (No. 56); the taotai of Heng Chou Fu (No. 58); the
                            taotai of Ch’ü Chou Fu (No. 61).</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, you have modified the demands of punishments which we had
                            made in our letter of April 4 for the exgovernor of Chekiang, Liu
                            Shu-tang (No. 63), and the treasurer of the same province, Yung Ch’uan
                            (No. 64).</p>
                        <p>We deem it necessary to insist on our first demands, as well in the cases
                            of the officials for whom we have thought it necessary to demand the
                            penalty of suspensive death as for the two latter.</p>
                        <p>Your highness and your excellency remarked in connection with some of
                            these punishments that they were incompatible with Chinese law. This is
                            an argument which we can not take into consideration. Our preoccupation
                            has been to repress with moderation and justice crimes against the law
                            of nations, against the laws of humanity, and against civilization,

                        </p>
                        <p>The incompleteness and uncertainty of all our information in respect to
                            the economic system prevailing in China, and the unreliability of all
                            the statistics of the revenues of China, except that collected under
                            European officers, render it impossible for the investigator abroad to
                            arrive at any satisfactory conclusion in respect to the financial policy
                            to be pursued with the object of providing indemnities.</p>
                        <p>It is alleged on all sides that collections of revenue by Chinese
                            officials are dishonestly conducted, are largely appropriated to private
                            uses, and that a minor fraction of these collections reach the official
                            treasury to which they are destined. This is alleged to be true in
                            respect alike to the collections for the Imperial and for the
                            provisional treasuries. The total revenue received by the Imperial
                            Government is approximately ascertained. The actual amount collected
                            from the various sources of revenue is conjectural, with the exception
                            of that derived from the customs duties. The following appear to be the
                            principal sources of taxation: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Land tax, in kind, commuted to money payment.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>

                                <label>4.</label>

                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>Native customs.</item>
                                <label>6.</label>
                                <item>Likin.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Of the foregoing taxes it is ascertained that a large part of the first
                            (land tax) is absorbed by peculation, and that if honestly collected and
                            paid over the aggregate proceeds would be much more than double. But the
                            attempt to put this revenue throughout the vast interior of China under
                            European control would encounter such obstacles and popular opposition
                            as to render it impracticable.</p>
                        <p>The fourth (salt duty) is already so high as to induce much smuggling,
                            and being an article of necessity ought not to be increased.</p>
                        <p>The fifth (native customs) yields a small amount of revenue, and foreign
                            intervention therein is not advisable.</p>
                        <p>The sixth (likin) appears by unanimous testimony to be locally variable,
                            often repeated, and the most obnoxious tax of all which affect imported
                            goods, and is the most burdensome of all upon foreign commerce, both
                            inward and outward, and ought to be wholly abolished, certainly upon
                            imports, and if possible on the exports of China.</p>
                        <p>The third (customs under foreign control) is the only item in the list in
                            respect to which changes can be made with a safe calculation of results
                            in the amount of revenue to be derived from an increase of rates.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that the likin (transit tax) on goods for export coming
                            from the interior might, like the likin on imported goods, be commuted
                            at an agreed rate, and collected under European supervision at the port
                            of destination. If this can be done, the result would be a large
                            increase in revenue from this source, with a diminished burden on the
                            goods. As an alternative it might possibly be stipulated that likin
                            should be collected only once in each province of China, the amount to
                            be definitely limited.</p>
                        <p>As provincial governments must have some source of revenue, the Imperial
                            Government should be at liberty to set aside for provincial use from the
                            proceeds of these likin taxes, if commuted, at least so much in amount
                            as is now derived therefrom by the provincial treasuries. This would
                            conciliate the viceroys and might remove their objections to the
                            exterior collection of this revenue, while avoiding local expenses and
                            peculations.</p>
                        <p>It appears that the paying stations for likin are not limited, but may be
                            increased in number, and the total assessments vary largely in different
                            provinces of China. There is also a “perfectural” duty (fu-shui) in some
                            provinces, which is reported as “a great incubus on trade.” There is,
                            besides, a regular export duty of 5 per cent in conformity with
                            treaties, and it seems that this may (like the regular import duty) be
                            in effect indefinitely increased by the likin on exports. There is
                            further reported an additional customs duty collected by native
                            authorities on <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0216"/>goods passing
                            from one port to another, called a coast-trade duty, which is said to be
                            assessed on both imports and exports.</p>
                        <p>It also appears from the note of the American Asiatic Association that
                            the Chinese have further applied a kind of octroi, called tso-ku, and a
                            sort of destination duty, called tso li, since the likin tax was
                            commuted to a fixed percentage.</p>
                        <p>Against all these varying and vexatious exactions outside the regular
                            duties, provision should be made by the proposed treaty, in order to
                            give security to international commerce.</p>
                        <p>It is also extremely desirable to abolish likin charges on exports, but
                            as their incidence is upon native products, the question of their
                            abolition, or of a commutation of them by a fixed per cent ad valorem,
                            to be paid in such manner as to be agreeable to the interests of the
                            Chinese treasury, must be deferred to the negotiators of the new
                            commercial arrangements. It is plainly for the interest of Chinese
                            production and export that some beneficial change should be made in the
                            present system.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">conclusions</hi>.</p>
                        <p>First. I concur in the opinion expressed by the writers of the
                            communications above referred to, that the total indemnities to be paid
                            by China, both on personal and on national claims, should be so graded
                            as not to exceed in the aggregate $200,000,000. A larger amount would
                            threaten bankruptcy of the Imperial treasury, or so weaken the
                            provincial treasuries as to provoke discontent and disorder in the
                            districts where it is of the highest importance to foreign commercial
                            interests to promote peace and prosperity.</p>
                        <p>Nor should it be forgotten that looting and destruction of property in
                            China by foreign troops should be taken into account in adjusting claims
                            for indemnity, if indemnity be considered a part of the punishment
                            imposed on China.</p>
                        <p>But aside from this point of view, excessive indemnity would depreciate
                            largely the value of the existing obligations of China now held abroad,
                            and would diminish the value of the new obligations to be issued by
                            China. On the contrary, if the indemnities now to be established are
                            plainly within her ability to pay, the value of her securities, both old
                            and new, will be maintained.</p>
                        <p>It should be especially remembered that full indemnity to foreign
                            governments is far less important to them than is the progressive
                            improvement of their trade with China. Future adequate security for
                            commerce, inward and outward, and for the persons who conduct it, is of
                            far greater advantage to the United States, to Russia, England, and
                            Germany, than are a few millions, more or less, paid now into their
                            treasuries. The latter is a temporary advantage, the former a permanent
                            investment which, wisely managed, will be followed by increasing returns
                            with unlimited gains to their respective peoples.</p>
                        <p>This view increases in importance in the ratio of Chinese prosperity. Let
                            the treaty arrangements assuredly promote this prosperity, with secure
                            opening of the country to foreign trade, and other compensation to
                            foreign governments might properly be scaled down to unquestionably
                            moderate figures to the advantage of all countries concerned.</p>
                        <p>Second. Assuming that the indemnity will be restrained within a
                            reasonable limit, consistent with Chinese resources, it seems
                            practicable to obtain the income required to defray the annual charges
                            by an increase of the customs duties, aided by a commutation of the
                            likin charges (inward and outward), such commutation to be collected
                            under foreign supervision, and paid in some defined proportion into the
                            Imperial treasury.</p>
                        <p>It appears to be the better opinion that the duties on imports must be
                            raised at least to 15 per cent ad valorem in lieu of the present rate.
                            The calculations must, of course, be based on the amount of the
                            indemnity, now unknown. Assuming this not to exceed 200,000,000, and
                            further assuming that the powers will accept the bonds of China instead
                            of compelling her to sell these bonds to raise the indemnity money in
                            open market with a further loss of capital, then it seems reasonable to
                            believe that China might provide for the annual interest and sinking
                            fund out of the proceeds of the augmented customs receipts, reenforced
                            as proposed by commutation of likin taxes, a definite proportion thereof
                            to be retained by the Imperial treasury.</p>
                        <p>Under no circumstances should it be forgotten that the main purpose of an
                            adjustment is to leave China in condition to produce profitably and to
                            buy in exchange for her production. If she is impoverished or reduced to
                            misery it means destruction to the growing market for which the powers
                            are now competing. Such punishment will fall on the commercial nations
                            equally with China.</p>
                        <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0217"/>
                        <p>Third. Instead of the continued occupation or proposed destruction of the
                            Chinese fortifications on the Peiho River, which latter more represents
                            temporary vengeance for the past than rational security for the future,
                            it seems to me a wiser policy for the allies to disarm the forts and to
                            reserve the right to reoccupy them in cases of disorder endangering
                            foreign rights or in case of future violation by China of the provisions
                            of the treaties, and to stipulate their nonoccupation by the Chinese
                            without the consent of the powers until the indemnity is fully
                            discharged. In this way the irritation caused by the perpetual presence
                            of foreign military sovereignty in Chinese territory would be avoided
                            and an additional motive supplied for the faithful observance of the
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>Fourth. It is desirable (if such an agreement by the allies shall be
                            possible) to provide that China shall not hereafter grant to nor place
                            under the jurisdiction of any foreign government any portion of her
                            territory without the consent of all the signatories to the present
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>Fifth. In respect to likin, a treaty provision of the following purport
                            is suggested:</p>
                        <p>That in consideration of the increased customs duties which in conformity
                            with this convention China is at liberty to impose upon the foreign
                            products imported, and in further consideration of the adjustment herein
                            made in respect to the transit tax (likin), it is agreed on the part of
                            China that no other transit tax (likin) and no octroi tax (tso-ku,
                            loti-shui), destination tax (tso-li), or other tax or charge, for any
                            purpose, in any form, or under any name, shall be levied or collected on
                            the imported goods which shall have paid the stipulated conventional
                            duties and charges; but the same shall be exempt from all other charges,
                            national, provincial, or local, in all parts of the Chinese Empire. A
                            certificate of such payment shall be issued by the collector of the
                            same, in duplicate, one copy to be retained by the importer and one copy
                            to accompany the shipment of the goods to their destination in the
                            Empire.</p>
                        <p>(If likin on exports is also adjusted, like provision to be made
                            applicable to them.)</p>
                        <p>Sixth. As far as the United States is concerned, it is important to
                            anticipate the efforts of other nations to secure exclusive advantages
                            for their allegiants, their shipping, or their commerce by agreeing with
                            China on a strongly worded most-favored nation clause. The following is
                            suggested for consideration:</p>
                        <p>That whatever privilege, exemption, benefit, or advantage is already or
                            may hereafter be conceded by China to the official representatives or to
                            the merchants, subjects, or citizens of any other country, in respect of
                            their persons, property, rights, or occupations, shall be at the same
                            time extended to the like official representatives, merchants, and
                            citizens of the United States; that the lowest rates of duty or other
                            charges imposed on personal property or articles of international
                            commerce of any foreign national origin shall be immediately applicable
                            to the like articles of United States origin; and no other or higher
                            duties, charges, burdens, or restrictions of any kind shall be imposed
                            on the exports of the United States than those imposed on the exports of
                            the most favored nation. All privileges, rights, exemptions, and
                            benefits now or hereafter accorded by China to the vessels of any other
                            foreign nation or to their cargoes or officers and crews shall be
                            equally enjoyed by those of the United States. It is fully understood by
                            both high contracting parties that the United States, the citizens
                            thereof, and their property and personal rights and privileges in China
                            shall continue to be treated on the most favorable terms conceded by
                            China to any foreign nation or people.</p>
                        <p>Seventh. In view of the state of war which has actually existed between
                            the allies and China, and in order to obtain security against a possible
                            claim that under international law existing treaties were annulled by
                            the war, it seems expedient to make a new treaty between the United
                            States and China, which shall provide for the payment of the indemnity
                            to the United States as adjusted, and shall at the same time declare
                            that all provisions of the conventions between the two countries which
                            were in force on the 1st day of January, A. D. 1900 are continued in
                            full force and effect, except so far as modified by the present
                            convention or by other conventions to which the United States is a
                            party.</p>
                        <p>The most-favored-nation article would naturally find a place in this
                            suggested treaty.</p>
                        <p>With the limited information at my command the foregoing embraces all the
                            opinions and suggestions which I feel sufficient assurance to express.
                            They are submitted with entire deference to the criticism of those who,
                            like the British controller of customs in China, have an intimate
                            acquaintance with local conditions, which must to a great extent control
                            foreign official action.</p>
                        <p>Respectfully submitted.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Sir</hi>: At the invitation of the president
                            of the Johns Hopkins University I last week delivered an address on the
                            revenue system of China before that institution. The question of the
                            amount of indemnity to be exacted from China is now actively occupying
                            the attention of the plenipotentiaries in Peking; and as I foresee that
                            the insistence on a sum beyond China’s capabilities will jeopardize both
                            the independence of that country and the future good relations of the
                            western powers among themselves, I venture to send you that portion of
                            my address which dealt with this question, in the hope that the
                            presentation of the actual facts and figures by one who has been
                            occupied with them for many years may help to confining the demands
                            within moderate and feasible limits.</p>

                        <p>The Chinese Government publishes, indeed frames, no national budget. Each
                            autumn, however, the board of revenues in Peking, as head of the
                            financial administration of the Empire, draws up a statement of the
                            requirements of the metropolitan administration and of the contributions
                            to be made toward them by the several provinces. The expenses of the
                            provincial administration are defrayed mainly from the land tax and
                            likin; and from what remains of them, from the salt gabelle, native
                            customs, and the bulk of the foreign customs revenue, those of the
                            imperial household, the metropolitan administration, the defense of the
                            northern provinces by land and by sea, the Fuchou Arsenal, etc., are
                            defrayed. From steady reading of the Peking Gazette, which is a
                            collection of such official documents as the privy council sees fit to
                            make public and which from time to time contains reports (more or less
                            fragmentary) from viceroys and governors on all these subjects, an
                            approximate estimate may be formed of China’s revenue,which may be
                            stated thus: <table rows="9" cols="3">

                        <p>Prior to 1895 the public debt of China amounted to only some $9,250,000.
                            In that year, however, hostilities broke out between Japan and China,
                            the exigencies of which forced the Nan-Yang Ta-ch’en to borrow, with
                            imperial sanction, some $25,000,000, while the final treaty of peace
                            imposed on China payment of an indemnity of taels 230,000,000, or at the
                            rate of exchange agreed upon of £27,615,000 ($138,075,000). Owing to
                            China’s impaired credit and flotation expenses, she had to borrow a
                            nominal total of $239,100,000 to pay this idemnity; and to cover
                            interest and sinking fund on all these loans China has to provide
                            annually— <table rows="4" cols="2">

                        <p>It is now stated that China will be required to pay as indemnity for the
                            destruction of life and property during the recent disturbances and for
                            cost of foreign military expeditions a sum not less than $200,000,000
                            nor more than $600,000,000. It is quite impossible for her to pay even
                            the lower sum. To pay $138,075,000 it was necessary for China, when her
                            maritime customs revenue was practically untouched, to incur an
                            indebtedness of $239,100,000. Now, when that revenue is mortgaged up <pb
                                n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0219"/>to the hilt, it would cost her
                            at least $275,000,000 to raise $200,000,000 in the open market; and that
                            is the only source from which she should attempt to produce funds, for
                            loans granted or guaranteed by one or more foreign governments would
                            inevitably result in constant interference in the administration of the
                            Empire, and therefore in weakening the power and prestige of the
                            Government, and thus tend to promote unrest and eventually
                            disintegration. To provide interest on and sinking fund for such a loan,
                            an annual charge of at least $25,000,000 would be required. How could
                            this be obtained? China’s revenue has been reduced by her present
                            indebtedness from over $60,000,000 to some $43,000,000, and, as the
                            documents in the Pekin Gazette show, the metropolitan and provincial
                            administrations are one and all in the greatest straits and are reduced
                            to pitiful expedients to avoid bankruptcy. To place a further charge of
                            $25,000,000 on the revenue would produce immediate default; the foreign
                            powers, as guarantors, would foreclose, and China’s independence would
                            be a thing of the past.</p>
                        <p>Is it, then, possible to institute new or increase old taxes to provide
                            funds? That to institute new taxes to pay indemnities to foreign powers
                            is the surest method to create and perpetuate general antiforeign
                            feeling is a self-evident proposition. As regards old taxes, the land
                            tax is moderate in amount, but it has remained so long at its present
                            rate that an increase, for no matter what reason, would create general
                            discontent and probably forcible opposition; to allow it to be published
                            that such an increase was made on the demand and for the benefit of
                            foreigners would be the height of folly. That the salt gabelle is a
                            grievous burden on a necessary article of daily food is proved by the
                            universal smuggling of salt that exists. To increase the tax would be
                            most unwise, and to change the method of collection would be impolitic,
                            if not dangerous, because the system is so complicated that no person
                            can tell what the effect of any change would be. Likin is already the
                            most grievous burden on the trade and prosperity of the Empire. Effort
                            should therefore be directed toward its abolition, not its increase. The
                            foreign customs: It is scarcely probable that the foreign powers would
                            consent to an increase in the treaty tariff, i. e., in the taxation of
                            their own goods, merely to supply funds from which indemnities would be
                            paid to themselves. As regards native customs, it would undoubtedly be a
                            step in the right direction to place these under the control of the
                            commissioners of foreign or maritime customs at the treaty ports, and
                            some increase in this amount would no doubt result, but it could not be
                            sufficient to bear the burden of so large a loan.</p>
                        <p>The leakage under the existing system of collection is admittedly so
                            great that it has been suggested that were an international financial
                            board substituted for that system it would be possible to enormously
                            increase the collection without adding to the present levies. The
                            objections to such a proposal are, however, serious; for putting aside
                            the international jealousies and intrigues which would inevitably result
                            in China as they have in Egypt from such a system, either the authority
                            of that board would be ignored, or, to enforce it in remote districts of
                            the interior, such constant interference in the provincial
                            administrations would be rendered necessary that the independence of
                            China, which all the foreign powers declare themselves anxious to
                            maintain, would vanish and the control of the Empire virtually pass into
                            foreign hands. The only course would, then, seem to be for the powers to
                            recognize that their treatment of China during late years is, as it
                            undoubtedly has been, one of the chief contributing causes of the recent
                            outbreak, and to therefore forego pecuniary indemnity for lives and the
                            expenses of the relief corps, confining such indemnity to property
                            destroyed alone, and to content themselves with insisting on the
                            adequate punishment of the high officials who actively or passively have
                            been responsible for the atrocities committed as the most likely means
                            of preventing the recurrence of such outrages in the future. Any other
                            course will, I firmly believe, result in calamities beyond all compare
                            greater than any which have yet happened.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Hay</hi>: I send you inclosed the English
                            version of a memorandum I have forwarded to his excellency Li
                            Chung-tang, regarding the financial arrangements I would suggest in the
                            coming negotiations with China, in the hope that after consideration the
                            proposal contained in it may commend itself to your approval.</p>
                        <p>I feel strongly that if foreign nations desire a permanent solution of
                            the Chinese difficulty, which, by removing causes of friction, will tend
                            to promote sympathy and <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0220"
                            />intercourse between China and the West, they must abandon the policy
                            followed in the past of regarding only what appear to be their own
                            personal interests in the terms they nominally negotiate, but
                            practically dictate, and must stop to consider what the effect of those
                            stipulations will be on China. Can she give effect to them? Will they be
                            advantageous to her? This of course means the lengthening out of
                            negotiations, because where government is as decentralized as it is in
                            China and the viceroys are rather coordinate than subordinate
                            authorities, it means that these latter must be consulted as to the
                            exigencies of provincial administration and a modus operandi arranged
                            with them. But the time will be well spent if thereby future
                            difficulties are avoided and the appearance of diction removed. For the
                            same reason I should be glad to see provision for the introduction of
                            reforms substituted for the clauses requiring the destruction of the
                            Taku forts and prohibiting the importation of arms—clauses which render
                            China helpless to resist aggression from without or attacks of rebels
                            within her borders.</p>
                        <p>Opposition on the part of the Chinese to the abolition of likin may be
                            anticipated, perhaps, because of the numerous staffs now employed in the
                            collection who would be thrown out of employment. But it has to be
                            remembered that the Chinese commission on tariff revision itself
                            proposed only a few months ago the abolition of that tax on all foreign
                            goods; so that the present proposal is rather merely another-step
                            forward than a new and radical change. It may, too, be objected that
                            even if China consents to the abolition she can not be relied on to keep
                            her engagements. There is, I believe, no sufficient ground for such an
                            apprehension; for in the case of the exemption of all internal taxation
                            on foreign opium, in return for the simultaneous collection of duty and
                            likin by the foreign customs, China has abundantly shown her willingness
                            and ability to give full effect to conventions that have really been
                            negotiated with her after consultation with the provincial authorities
                            chiefly affected by those conventions.</p>
                        <p>Finally, four times the tariff rate on exports may prove too high a tax
                            in the case of low-priced articles, such as skins or of others, which
                            have to compete on a narrow margin of profit with the products of other
                            countries; but China may, I think, be trusted to, in such cases, herself
                            grant reductions. In any case, especially to cover the case of tea,
                            values of which have considerably declined since the tariff was framed
                            in 1800, it might be stipulated that the duties as now fixed shall in no
                            case exceed 20 per cent.</p>

                        <p>It has been officially stated in the German Reichstag that among the
                            proposals advanced by the foreign ministers in Peking with a view to the
                            settlement of the recent outbreak in China, and to preventing a
                            recurrence thereof in the future, is one dealing with a revision of
                            taxation on merchandise. There can be no doubt that revision is
                            eminently desirable, but to be effective and advantageous it must be
                            such as will, on the one hand, further the stability of the Chinese
                            Government, and, on the other, avoid so far as possible the imposition
                            of new burdens on trade, internal and external alike. How can this best
                            be achieved?</p>
                        <p>That likin is a grievous burden on the trade and prosperity of the Empire
                            is admitted by all, whether Chinese or foreigners. Instituted in the
                            early fifties to provide funds for the operations necessary to effect
                            the suppression of the Taiping rebels, it was then described as an
                            indispensable tax for the time being, and to be abrogated as soon as
                            peace was restored. It has continued indispensable ever since; and its
                            abolition now, when the treasuries, both metropolitan and provincial,
                            have been already reduced to the lowest ebb by the service of the loans
                            required to pay off the Japanese war indemnity, is out of the question,
                            unless means are found to make good from other sources the funds now
                            derived from likin. Yet, because it is such a burden, every effort
                            should be devoted toward effecting the abolition of it. And this would
                            be effected if the foreign powers will consent to the tariff duties
                            being quadrupled, and to the abolition of the duty-free privileges,
                            except for bullion and for articles imported for the importer’s personal
                            use and not for sale, granted by supplementary rule 2 appended to the
                            tariff, on the condition that China abolishes likin and lo-ti-shui, and
                            to secure uniformity.</p>
                        <p>When this rule was framed in 1860 there were but few foreign merchants
                            established in China, and it was considered but fair that articles
                            imported by them for household and office use should be admitted duty
                            free. In the intervening forty <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0221"
                            />years conditions have altogether changed, and many of those articles
                            are now used in large quantities by the Chinese. Thus it results that
                            the Chinese Government is debarred from raising any revenue from the
                            large quantities of flour, wines, spirits, tobacco, underclothing, etc.,
                            brought into China not for the importer’s personal use, but for general
                            sale. This is unjust. The wise course would be to abrogate the entire
                            clause. But if that is considered open to objection, all that foreign
                            nations can fairly ask is that what an individual imports for his own
                            use be excepted of treatment by all offices—transfers the native customs
                            establishments at the treaty ports to the control of the foreign or
                            maritime customs. To secure this consent, it is necessary to satisfy the
                            powers that such a rearrangement of the taxes will not only be
                            beneficial to China, but impose no serious additional burden on foreign
                            trade. I believe that not only can this be proved, but that the proposal
                            would actually benefit trade, alike foreign and native. It is therefore
                            proposed to consider the results of the adoption of this proposal as
                            affecting (a) foreign trade, (b) native trade, and (c) the Chinese.
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Foreign trade.</hi>—The name
                            likin indicates that originally it was intended to represent a tax of
                            only 1 per million ad valorem. If it ever represented so moderate a levy
                            it has long ceased to do so, and in some cases, as reference to the
                            tariffs will show, a single levy now amounts to as much as 18 per cent,
                            while liability to likin in one province is not exhausted until two and
                            one-half levies have been made, and payment in one province does not
                            grant exemption in the next; crossing the frontier renews the liability
                            afresh. What is the average percentage of value thus levied on
                            merchandise in transit in any one province it is impossible to say. But
                            I know from personal experience, while commissioner of customs at
                            Shanghai, that native merchants were willing to pay three and one-half
                            times the tariff rate, or about 17½ per cent, in order to secure transit
                            pass privileges—i. e., exemption from inland taxes and comparatively
                            speedy examination at the tax stations passed—for some of the less
                            highly taxed products of the province (Kiangsu) in which Shanghai is
                            situated. Those products therefore would pay 22½ per cent before export
                            abroad, and 25 per cent if sent to another treaty port in China—i. e.,
                            taxes in either case higher than the total now proposed, about 20 per
                            cent; and naturally the payment of this percentage constituted an
                            advantage over payment of inland taxes, or merchants would not have
                            desired the introduction of such an arrangement.</p>
                        <p>It will no doubt be objected that the transit privileges already enjoyed
                            under the treaty of Tientsin, whereby foreign goods may be sent to any
                            inland mart or native goods purchased by foreign merchants for export
                            abroad may be brought down to any treaty port free of taxes en route on
                            payment of half-tariff duty of 2½ per cent only, are far more favorable
                            than the proposal now submitted. To answer this objection satisfactorily
                            attention must be invited to the following considerations: <list>
                                <item>First. Stipulations which the central government may be
                                    compelled by force majeure to accept may have the effect of
                                    depriving the provincial administrations of funds indispensable
                                    to the maintenance of their government. This has been the case
                                    in the matter of these transit privileges. And when that is so
                                    it stands to reason that the provincial governor must be reduced
                                    to the position either of being unable to maintain his
                                    administration or of rendering nugatory the stipulations which
                                    deprive his exchequer of the funds necessary to the government
                                    of his province. Either course will bring him into collision
                                    with the central government, but the latter course is so far the
                                    less serious from a national point of view that he naturally
                                    adopts it. The result is to place the central government on the
                                    horns of a dilemma—either it must compel compliance with
                                    stipulations, the carrying out of which may ruin the province,
                                    or it must acquiesce in, and if needs be defend, the infraction
                                    of an engagement it has itself entered into. This state of
                                    affairs naturally results in loss of prestige and power to the
                                    Government, in charges being brought against it of bad faith,
                                    and in constant disputes with foreign powers, as the history of
                                    foreign intercourse with China during the past years clearly
                                    demonstrates has been the case. And this lamentable state of
                                    things will continue so long as foreign nations, looking only to
                                    their own self-interest and ignorant or unmindful of the
                                    consequences of their demands, insist on China’s agreeing to
                                    what it is practically impossible for her to carry out.</item>
                                <item>Second. These transit privileges do not touch the question of
                                    lo-ti-shui, or local octroi, and past experience shows that the
                                    tendency (for the reasons given above) has been to nullify these
                                    privileges by requiring goods covered by transit pass to pay on
                                    arrival at the specified destination a differential tax
                                    amounting practically to the total of the taxes escaped en route
                                    to the province. Is it not then the part of wise statesmanship
                                    to abandon trying to insist on the impossible, and instead to
                                    agree to terms which will put a not too onerous tax on trade and
                                    will remove one of the chief causes of constant friction and
                                    bickering?</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0222"/>
                        <p>In a word, so far as foreign trade is concerned, I believe this proposal
                            will remove one of the chief causes of discussion between foreign
                            nations and China, and will tend rather to lighten than to increase the
                            taxation now levied on the merchandise that constitutes foreign
                            trade.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Native trade.</hi>—Every
                            removal of a tax produces a corresponding reduction in the laying-down
                            cost of commodities. It thus acts as a stimulus to trade, and increases
                            the strength of the Government by calling forth the gratitude of the
                            people toward it for action directly tending to promote its well-being.
                            That the free interchange of products throughout the Empire would
                            largely develop general prosperity, lower prices, and promote
                            consumption, there can be no doubt. Thus the Government would be
                            strengthened, the people enriched, and foreign trade benefited.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Chinese Government</hi>.—The
                            collection reported by the various provinces on account of likin and
                            lo-ti-shui amounts to a maximum sum of taels 16,000,000 annually. It is
                            proposed, in order to win the support of viceroys and governors to the
                            scheme, to allot to each province from the Chinese collection the full
                            amount reported, together with an allowance in addition of 25 per cent,
                            or 20,000,000 taels in all. The proposal would then work out as follows:

                        <p>If, as it is rumored, foreign nations exact an indemnity of $200,000,000
                            gold, an annual sum of at least 24,000,000 taels will be required for
                            the service of the necessary loans; but 11,500,000 (some £1,875,000)
                            would thus remain to meet the needs of the Government. To exact an
                            indemnity of $200,000,000 gold, without assenting to the proposed plan
                            would plunge the Empire into bankruptcy; to exact more, even if that
                            plan be assented to, would render the introduction of necessary reforms
                            in the administration impossible, even if the Empire were not reduced to
                            penury. To adopt this scheme and confine the indemnity to, at the most,
                            $200,000,000 gold, would, I feel confident, strengthen the Government,

                        <p>The American Asiatic Association, recognizing the fianancial necessities
                            of the Chinese Empire, has no objection to offer to the proposed
                            increase of duties on foreign imports. The suggestion which, according
                            to Sir Robert Hart, was formulated last spring by the special commission
                            appointed to consider the subject of tariff revision, is deemed a
                            reasonable one. This was to the effect that the import duty should be
                            fixed at 10 per cent plus 5 per cent transit due, payable
                            simultaneously, coupled with the total abolition of all other taxes on
                            such imports forever after and everywhere. In other words, it is
                            proposed to double the present customs duty on foreign imports, and with
                            it to double the sum charged for transit dues. Assuming that this is all
                            that is intended, and that no attempt will be made, by changing the
                            present method of fixing the ad valorem duties, to subject foreign trade
                            to more than twice the present import rates, the association can see no
                            objection to the acceptance of such a basis of tariff agreement. The
                            suggestion seems to offer all the more satisfactory a solution of the
                            vexed question of inland taxation, since it was only agreed to after
                            consultation with the provisional authorities, and since it was to be
                            accompanied by a stipulation that the General Government was to arrange
                            for the equitable division of the amount so realized between the central
                            and the provisional treasuries.</p>
                        <p>In approving of such a plan this association is not unmindful of the fact
                            that the inland transportation tax collected under the name of likin has
                            been from the first a most objectionable impost, was devised to meet
                            special conditions of financial necessity, and has been continued in
                            defiance of promises that when the finances of the country had recovered
                            their normal condition the likin should be abolished. But the most
                            serious grievance has been that the agreement in regard to the payment
                            of likin on imports bears a totally different meaning to the Chinese
                            authorities and to the foreign merchants. In the convention between the
                            United States and China for the regulation of trade, concluded November
                            8, 1858, the undertaking as to likin seems to be expressed with
                            sufficient clearness. It is as follows, the language being identical
                            with that of the agreement concluded between Great Britain and
                            China:</p>
                        <p>“Merchandise shall be cleared of its transit dues under the following
                            regulations:</p>
                        <p>“In the case of imports. Notice being given at the port of entry from
                            which the imports are to be forwarded inland of the nature and the
                            quantity of goods, the ship from which they have been landed, and the
                            place inland to which they are bound, with all other necessary
                            particulars, the collector of customs shall, on due inspection made and
                            on receipt of the transit duty due, issue a transit-duty certificate.
                            This must be produced at every barrier station and viséd. No further
                            duty shall be leviable upon imports so certified, no matter how distant
                            the place of their destination.”</p>
                        <p>The association is fully aware of the fact that the British Board of
                            Trade, when John Bright was its president, approved of an interpretation
                            of this rule calculated to deprive it of most of its value to the
                            foreign merchant. Even as modified by the then minister of foreign
                            affairs, Lord Clarendon, in February, 1870, this interpretation was made
                            to read as follows:</p>
                        <p>“The fair construction which ought, in the opinion of Her Majesty’s
                            Government, to be placed on these provisions is that foreign produce may
                            be imported on payment of 5 per cent, and circulated in equal
                            competition with similar Chinese products at <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218"
                                facs="0224"/>the port and its vicinity, and maybe placed at any
                            specified place in the interior, also for the purpose of equal
                            competition with such Chinese produce, on payment of a transit duty of
                            2½ per cent in addition to the import duty. It can not, they think, be
                            legally contended that there is anything to prevent the Chinese from
                            charging whatever general municipal taxes are leviable on Chinese goods
                            at the port or in the interior equally on foreign goods when once they
                            enter into general circulation and consumption.”</p>
                        <p>The likin stipulation has been applied by the Chinese authorities ever
                            since in this highly elastic sense to the great detriment of the closely
                            related interests of both American and British trade. It was admitted by
                            Lord Granville, in 1883, that the British interpretation has never been
                            recognized by the representatives in China of the Great European powers
                            or the United States, and further, that under other treaties, notably
                            those of France and Germany, it is held that imports which have paid a
                            transit due in addition to an import duty are thenceforth free from all
                            taxation whatever.</p>
                        <p>The difficulty experienced in the past in making a definite and
                            thoroughly binding bargain with the Chinese Government on the subject of
                            internal taxation must be held to demand the exercise of extreme care on
                            the part of the negotiators of the revised treaties. It has been a
                            constant struggle, attended only with partial success, to compel respect
                            for the validity of transit passes en route; but even when this was
                            accorded, persistent efforts have been made by provincial authorities to
                            indemnify themselves by imposing likin, under another name, at either
                            end of the journey. In southern China, notably, the greatest ingenuity
                            has been shown in subjecting foreign goods to various forms of local
                            taxation. Among these are tso ku (octroi) and loti likin, or tso-li, a
                            kind of destination duty, both calculated to enable the provincial
                            authorities to collect an amount sufficient to reimburse them for the
                            levies they have been obliged to abandon during the transit of the
                            goods.</p>
                        <p>In any new bargain with China in regard to the taxation of foreign
                            merchandise, strenuous objection ought to be made to the employment of
                            the tax-farming system, under which foreign trade may be made to yield a
                            revenue quite as much for the profit of individuals as for that of the
                            Government. It is a matter of record that in 1891–92, when the Kowloon
                            and Lappa stations took over the collection of likin on kerosene oil
                            previously farmed out they in six months collected, at the farmer’s
                            rates, about 75 per cent more than he would have paid into the treasury
                            in twelve months as the price of his monopoly. Not only is the farm
                            system hostile to all treaty agreements, but, as Mr. J. W. Jamieson has
                            pointed out, it is always open for the holder of the monopoly to trade
                            on his own account and thus be able to undersell all competitors. At the
                            root of the whole question is the difficulty of providing for provincial
                            necessities without having recourse to the levy of exactions on foreign
                            trade not contemplated in the treaties. It must therefore be obvious
                            that any bargain with the Central Government which has not had the
                            approval of the great viceroys must be difficult if not impossible of
                            enforcement. This fact has evidently been recognized by the commission,
                            of which Sir Robert Hart is a member, and will no doubt be given due
                            weight by the negotiators appointed by the powers.</p>
                        <p>This association approves of the policy indicated by the commission on
                            tariff revision of retaining the 5 per cent rate on exports. Cumbrous as
                            the method seems, it is probable that the only practical way to free
                            exports from cumulative taxation is to do away with the right to bring
                            produce from the interior under transit passes, coupled with an
                            undertaking to refund to the exporter at the time of export to a foreign
                            country whatever amounts he had paid on such produce over and above a
                            half tariff rate between the place of purchase and the port of export.
                            In any case, it seems a suicidal policy for China to subject goods
                            intended for export to any but the lightest possible taxation, and it
                            should not be difficult to convince its negotiators that the country’s
                            growth in wealth must be largely dependent on the encouragement given to
                            the expansion of its foreign trade.</p>
                        <p>The fact that the permission given to the steamers, native or foreign, to
                            navigate the inland waters of China has been, so far as foreign flags
                            are concerned, a practically barren one, is mainly due to the power for
                            obstruction possessed by the likin officials. It seems probable that
                            until the collection of both native and maritime customs, as well as all
                            transit taxes, is placed under one hand the utilization of either the
                            grand canal or the great rivers for local steam navigation must be
                            indefinitely postponed. At every point of the discussion of improved
                            conditions for foreign commerce in China there is encountered the
                            dominant question of a reform of the whole fiscal administration of the
                            Empire. Into this larger subject this association has not felt called on
                            to enter, believing that the future fiscal system of China must be
                            controlled by considerations which, while vitally important to commerce,
                            can not be regarded as purely commercial either in character or
                            origin.</p>

                            of the 27th year of Kuang Hsu (30th of March, 1901) we received from
                            your excellency a dispatch (dated March 29) in which you say that “to
                            carry out the conditions of the Joint Note of the 22d of December, 1900,
                            which was accepted by His Majesty the Emperor of China, the foreign
                            representatives have drawn up a list of the towns in which, in
                            conformity with Article II, paragraph <hi rend="italic">b</hi>,
                            foreigners having been massacred or subjected to cruel treatment, all
                            official examinations shall be suspended for five years.” Your
                            excellency transmits this list with the request, in the name of your
                            colleagues; that His Majesty the Emperor of China, be asked to publish
                            an Imperial decree suspending all official examinations for five years
                            in the towns indicated in this list, in which foreigners have been
                            massacred, or have been subjected to cruel treatment.</p>
                        <p>The suspension of civil and military examinations is a condition provided
                            for by the last paragraph of Article II of the peace protocol drawn up
                            last year, and the said article stipulates that the suspension during
                            five years of the civil and military examinations would only apply to
                            the towns in which people of various countries have been massacred or
                            have been subjected to cruel treatment.</p>
                        <p>We stated in our memorandum of the 11th Moon of last year (January, 1901)
                            “that the cities and towns in each prefecture, subprefecture,
                            department, and district are very numerous. It will be necessary to
                            ascertain in what cities and towns foreigners have been massacred or
                            been subjected to cruel treatment, when of course action as laid down
                            will be taken. This provision evidently applies to the Sui and Ko
                            examinations. As regards the provincial and metropolitan examinations,
                            these are collective examinations for each province. Should there be in
                            a province cities or towns where foreigners have been massacred or
                            subjected to cruel treatment, separate enquiry, as above mentioned,
                            ought to be made and action taken accordingly. In other cities and
                            towns, not in any way implicated, examinations ought to take place as
                            usual. Such a course of procedure will serve as an exhortation and
                            warning.” The representatives of the powers are already fully aware of
                            this.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding this, in the list drawn up of localities in which
                            examinations shall be suspended, the designations have been made by
                            prefectures and districts, and not by towns, and this is a noteworthy
                            amplification of the original text of the last paragraph of Article II.
                            If, for example, in a district there happens to be a town in which
                            foreigners have been massacred or have been subjected to cruel
                            treatment, the suspension of examinations should apply at that town
                            alone, and it would not be proper to exclude from the examinations
                            candidates throughout the entire district.</p>
                        <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0227"/>
                        <p>As regards prefectures, such territorial divisions comprise a number of
                            districts, one remote from the other. In such cases it would be even
                            more impossible to apply the suspension of examinations to a whole
                            prefecture, because this measure is applicable to a town situated within
                            it. Such a mode of procedure would not be logical. If it is alleged that
                            examinations begin with the prefectures and districts, and that there
                            are no special examinations for towns of inferior rank, and for that
                            reason it was only possible to speak of prefectures and districts, such
                            would not be the language of one who was thoroughly conversant with the
                            true condition of things; for when the prefectural examinations, as well
                            as the district examinations, take place, the students of the towns in
                            which examinations have been suspended would not be authorized to have
                            themselves entered for them. All others, however, should take part in
                            these examinations as in ordinary times. The distinction is easily
                            made.</p>
                        <p>If because in a certain town evil doers have brought about disorders, it
                            would result, if the above plan was followed, that peaceful and honest
                            people living in the other cities would all have to be subject to the
                            suspension of examinations for several years, in which case the sense of
                            the phrase in the memorandum “as encouragement and warning.” would be
                            distorted and simply be a warning to evil doers and no encouragement to
                            the law-abiding people. Would such a mode of procedure be equitable and
                            likely to produce a good impression on the population?</p>
                        <p>We are therefore naturally led to ask the plenipotentiaries of the powers
                            to have drawn up a detailed list giving the towns, and not a general
                            designation by prefectures and districts, in which foreigners have been
                            massacred or have been subjected to cruel treatment. This will be in
                            conformity with the text of article II, and will place us in a position
                            to ask for an edict stating the localities in which examinations should
                            be suspended.</p>
                        <p>Such is the official reply which we send you, Monsieur le Doyen,
                            requesting you to bring it before the plenipotentiaries of the powers so
                            that they can act accordingly.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Highness and Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to
                            acknowledge receipt of your dispatch of 2d of April, replying to the
                            demand which the plenipotentiaries of the powers sent you concerning the
                            execution of Paragraph B of article II of the Joint Note accepted by His
                            Majesty the Emperor of China.</p>
                        <p>You seem to believe that my colleagues have given to the application of
                            the measure on the principle of which they reached an agreement with you
                            an extension which it does not comport. You invoke in this regard a
                            paragraph of memorandum of the 16th of January in which you formulated
                            observations on the conditions which were imposed on you.</p>
                        <p>I must call your attention, in the first place, to the fact that the
                            terms of this memorandum have never been accepted by the
                            plenipotentiaries of the powers, who have, on the contrary, reserved to
                            themselves to pursue the integral carrying out of the articles of the
                            Joint Note.</p>
                        <p>I may add as concerns the particular question which is the object of this
                            dispatch that you misapprehend entirely the intentions which inspired
                            the drafting of the paragraph concerning the suppression of examinations
                            in the towns in which foreigners have been massacred or have been
                            subjected to cruel treatments. The object of this article was to insure,
                            by means to which the Empire has itself sometimes had recourse, the
                            prevention of crimes committed with the assistance and most frequently
                            at the instigation of the literati class. This object would not be
                            attained if the plan which you suggest were accepted, because it would
                            permit the literati to evade the penalty which the representatives of
                            the powers have sought to inflict on them, and to preserve by fraud or
                            by eluding the application of the intended measure the right of which it
                            is intended to deprive them.</p>
                        <p>My colleagues have consequently decided to insist on the necessity of
                            granting them the satisfaction which they have demanded, and which could
                            only be rendered more stringent if they entered, as you ask them, into a
                            detailed examination of the cities in which the examinations should be
                            suspended, because they would be led, without a doubt, to extend this
                            measure to whole provinces.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: On the 2d of May we received
                            from the Grand Council at Si-an a telegram stating that the governor of
                            Hunan had wired that by the terms of the Joint Note there shall be a
                            suspension of all official examinations for five years in all the towns
                            where foreigners have been massacred. It appears that in the matter of
                            the missionary cases in Wei Yang and Ch’ing Chuan, in the Hunan
                            Province, these were the result of trouble brought about by rebels and
                            not the literati, and naturally the order of suspension should not apply
                            there. The trouble only occurred in the towns of Huang-sha-han and
                            Chiang-tzu-k’ou, in the jurisdiction of the above-named districts. Even
                            if the examinations were to be suspended, it should only be done at the
                            two towns mentioned where the trouble occurred. The suspension of
                            examinations merely refers to places where the Boxers created trouble
                            last year. This rule should not apply to missionary cases that occurred
                            in other places. If the examinations must be suspended, it would seem
                            necessary to clearly state that the suspension shall apply to the two
                            towns where the trouble occurred, and not involve the whole province.
                            This is important, for the sake of justice and fairness.</p>
                        <p>Having received the above we would beg to observe that in the matter of
                            the suspension of examinations, correspondence on the subject has passed
                            between the foreign representatives and ourselves, but nothing has been
                            definitely settled. We would embrace the opportunity, however, of again
                            expounding our views in a clear and minute way.</p>
                        <p>The suspension of examinations for the period of five years refers to the
                            people living in places where disturbances have occurred—the result of
                            the Boxer movement—who can not compete during that time; it has no
                            reference to places where disturbances occurred (not the result of the
                            Boxer movement). Take, for instance, Peking, where last year a
                            revolution took place resulting in loss of life to foreigners of all
                            nationalities. The native scholars resident in the capital are punished
                            by the examinations not being open to them, which is perfectly right and
                            proper. But Peking is the capital of China, and the “Chü-jen” of the
                            various provinces come here to enter the metropolitan examinations.
                            Then, as to the examinations for the second degree in the Shün-t’ien
                            prefecture, we may add that these are open to senior licentiates and
                            students of the imperial academy of the southern, northern, and central
                            provinces. This examination is not confined alone to students of the
                            metropolitan prefecture. If the metropolitan examinations for the third
                            degree and the metropolitan prefecture examinations for the second
                            degree are to be suspended, then in that case the students of all the
                            provinces will not be able to compete for the above degrees, and as the
                            result of the disturbances in many cities and towns the scholars of the
                            Empire would all thus be cut off from entering the official carrier.
                            Besides, it is the illiterate vagabonds who cause trouble, and by such a
                            mode of procedure the peaceable, law-abiding scholars would in like
                            maner be implicated with them. Would this be strictly in accordance with
                            justice? Foreign missionaries are a class associated with the scholars
                            of China, and if the examinations at Pekin are suspended to scholars
                            this would create a feeling of enmity which would not be befitting.</p>
                        <p>We therefore ask that the examinations be suspended only to persons
                            resident in the places where it is right they should be prohibited, but
                            not to those living in said cities or towns (where disturbances
                            occurred). The examinations of an entire prefecture or district should
                            not be suspended—a discrimination should be made. The suspension of
                            examinations for five years should apply to places where the Boxers
                            created trouble last year; other places should not be affected by this
                            ruling.</p>
                        <p>In sending this communication to your excellency, we beg that you will

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Highness and Excellency</hi>: You asked me in a
                            dispatch, under date 4th of May, to communicate to my colleagues a
                            telegram from the grand council concerning the towns in which
                            examinations were to be suspended during a period of five years, in
                            compliance with article 11 of the Joint Note.</p>
                        <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0229"/>
                        <p>You explain in this connection that according to your opinion the
                            suspension of examinations should consist “in the interdiction for the
                            residents of localities in I which troubles have occurred to present
                            themselves at the examinations during a period of five years, and not in
                            the interdiction during five years to allow examinations in localities
                            in which troubles occurred.” It is on the contrary this last
                            interpretation which is the correct one. To convince you of this, it is
                            sufficient to consider the text Paragraph B of article II of the Joint
                            Note accepted by His Majesty the Emperor of China. This paragraph is
                            worded as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Suspension of all official examinations during five years in all the
                            towns in which foreigners have been massacred or subjected to cruel
                            treatments.”</p>
                        <p>You observe, as confirming your explanations, that at Peking in
                            particular the suppression of examinations would work a hardship on
                            people from all the provinces who may not have taken part in the
                            troubles of last year, and you add that those guilty of the disorders
                            were ignorant people and ruffians. You show yourself thus most severe on
                            the princess and high officials whom you have already recognized as
                            responsible for the crimes to which you refer. We entertain grave doubt
                            whether the criminals can be considered as ignorant, though we do not
                            contest that they behaved like ruffians.</p>
                        <p>Speaking in a general way, it has been, on the contrary, the literati who
                            have always been and who were, particularly last year, the real authors
                            or accomplices of the antiforeign movement, and the Chinese people can
                            only be held responsible, as it were, for having been dragged into the
                            movement.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of the powers insist, therefore, on the demands which
                            they have made on you, and which are entirely in conformity with article
                            11 of the note which you have accepted.</p>
                        <p>I avail myself, etc.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: On the 13th instant we had the
                            honor to receive a communication (dated March 11), in reply from your
                            excellency in regard to the matter of the suspension of examinations for
                            a period of five years. Your excellency states that the real purpose is
                            that the examinations should be suspended for that period at places
                            where disturbances took place. The foreign representatives must, in
                            accordance with the terms of article II of the Joint Note, still adhere
                            to their original views, etc.</p>
                        <p>In reply, we may observe that the suspension of the examinations for five
                            years to persons in places where disturbances occurred is a most
                            complete way of exposing them to undergo punishment in public. Since the
                            foreign representatives are acting in accordance with the terms of
                            article II of the Joint Note, having relation to the suspension of
                            examinations, we may state that we agree to the suspension at the places
                            named in the list, in accordance with the terms of your excellency’s
                            note; hence there is no need for further discussion on that point by
                            us.</p>
                        <p>We may point out, however, that there are extreme difficulties to
                            overcome as regards the metropolitan examinations at Peking, the
                            examinations for the second degree held in the metropolitan prefecture.
                            These are collective examinations for the scholars of all the provinces
                            and can only be held at Peking. If these examinations are not to be
                            allowed, then, on account of trouble caused by persons in, say, one or
                            two provinces, the scholars of twenty-two and more provinces will surfer
                            by their suspension. Really this means the examinations for the whole of
                            China, and would not seem to be fair and just. The provincial
                            examinations in Shansi are held, according to law, at Tai-yuan Fu. It is
                            estimated that in the troubles in Shansi, taking the departments and
                            districts of the whole province where foreigners were massacred, that
                            only one-fourth of the province is concerned. If the examinations are to
                            be suspended at Tai-yuan Fu, then that would mean the suspension of the
                            provincial examinations for the whole province, and if no provincial
                            examinations are held, then the students will have no way of competing
                            at the metropolitan examinations. Suspension should be at the places
                            where trouble occurred and not every place. It would be no easy matter
                            to be reconciled to this method of procedure. We believe it is not by
                            any means certain that the views of the foreign representatives are not
                            with us in this matter. Therefore the metropolitan examinations at
                            Peking, and the provincial examinations at Shun-tien Fu and Tai-yuan Fu
                            should be carried on as heretofore, and not suspended for five
                            years.</p>
                        <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0230"/>
                        <p>Farther, it appears that in Ho Chien and Tsang Chou, in Chihli, no
                            massacre of foreigners took place. The missionaries know this to be the
                            case. Examinations at these places should not be suspended.</p>
                        <p>We had already prepared a memorandum on the above subject, but we did not
                            send it to your excellency. We therefore send this communication to your
                            excellency and will thank you to confer with your colleagues on the
                            subject here presented and favor us with a reply at an early date.</p>

                            with the proposal made by his excellency the minister of Russia, in the
                            forty-seventh meeting, the commission on indemnities has been directed
                            to draw up a list of the indemnities asked until the 1st of July,
                            calculated in haikwan taels at the rate of April 1, 1901.</p>
                        <p>As president of said commission, I have the honor to communicate herewith
                            the desired list, begging my honorable colleagues to be pleased to
                            indicate any errors which may occur in it.</p>
                        <p>The rate on the first of April, 1901, was, according to information
                            derived from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation: <table

                        <p>The demands of Spain and the Netherlands having been submitted in haikwan
                            taels, it was not necessary for the commission to figure either the rate
                            of the peseta or that of the Dutch florin.</p>
                        <p>Since, according to unofficial information, the sum of 4,000,000 taels
                            figures on the lists of two legations, and since the claims of societies
                            and private individuals in the case of most of the legations are put
                            down without any count being taken of probable or even certain
                            reductions, the commission on indemnities is of opinion that the sum of
                            450,000,000 haikwan taels will not be exceeded up to the first of July
                            of the present year.</p>

                        note which I sent to-day to the dean of the diplomatic corps asking him to
                        communicate to the represenatives of the powers the formal suggestion of the
                        United States to submit the question of the indemnity to be asked of China
                        to the Arbitral Tribunal of The Hague.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>Since my telegram to you of the 6th instant no other powers save those
                        therein indicated have informed the conference that they agree to limit
                        their claims-to July 1 and will accept 4 per cent interest. I am informed by
                        the French minister that his Government accepts the limitation of the
                        indemnity to 450,000,000 taels, but he has not stated that it accepts the
                        interest specified. France’s acceptance is,’ furthermore, conditional on the
                        agreement of the powers to a jointly guaranteed loan. Russia, I have reasons
                        to believe, entertains exactly the same views.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese minister tells me that his Government can not agree to 4 per
                        cent interest, as it can only borrow at 5 per cent.</p>
                    <p>The moment is the best, I think, I could have chosen for the formal
                        submission of your proposal.</p>

                            honor to inform our honorable colleagues that our Government hoped that
                            in case the powers should unfortunately be unable to reach an agreement
                            on the question of the indemnity to be asked of China they would be able
                            to agree to submit this question to the Arbitral Tribunal of The
                            Hague.</p>
                        <p>In view of the apparent impossibility of reaching a settlement of this
                            question satisfactory alike to all the powers, my Government, in the
                            hope of hastening its solution, has ordered me to formally propose to
                            the representatives of the powers to submit it to the Arbitral Tribunal
                            of The Hague.</p>

                            of my Government before the representatives of the powers, who will be
                            pleased to take it in consideration, I avail myself of this occasion to

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The diplomatic corps held a meeting to-day to
                        consider the question of the revenues to be set apart by China for the
                        payment of the interest and amortization of the indemnity debt, the
                        discussion of this subject having been suspended sometime ago on account of
                        great divergence of views between the various representatives.</p>
                    <p>The French minister stated to-day that he was authorized by his Government to
                        examine the resources of China best suited to this purpose; that his
                        Government believed that revenues which could be placed under the control of
                        the Chinese Maritime Customs presented the best guaranty, and that it would,
                        therefore, be pleased to see the tariff on imports increased to 10 per cent.
                        If, however, this could not be, the French Government was willing to accept
                        the revenue derived from the salt gabelle, which had been offered for this
                        purpose by the Chinese plenipotentiaries in their note of May 11, 1901, copy
                        of which I inclosed you in my dispatch, No. 86, of May 16.</p>
                    <p>The Russian minister stated that he had the same instructions; that his
                        Government also desired an increase of the tariff on imports, but would
                        accept the revenue offered on the salt, on condition that in case the
                        payments on account of interest on the indemnities were not regularly made,
                        the powers would consider the eventual increase of customs dues on imports
                        up to 10 per cent, the increase derivable from this source to be entirely
                        affected to the payments on account of the new debt.</p>
                    <p>I stated that the Government of the United States agreed with the French and
                        Russian Governments in considering that the best possible security for the
                        payments on account of the loan would be revenues placed under the control
                        of the Maritime Customs, and that it would agree to an increase of the
                        tariff to 10 per cent on the following conditions: <list>
                            <item>First. General revision of the tariff and conversion of ad valorem
                                into specific duties.</item>
                            <item>Second. Removal of the prohibition on the exportation of
                                rice.</item>
                            <item>Third. Abolition of all likin, including transit dues and all
                                inland taxation of every kind on all foreign imports.</item>
                            <item>Fourth. Revision of the tariff of likin charges on native produce
                                destined for exportation, especially tea, raw cotton, and silk, and
                                other important articles of export trade; and</item>
                            <item>Fifth. Participation by the Chinese Government in improvements of
                                the waterways leading to Shanghai and Tientsin.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>These suggestions of mine had been made known to the representatives of the
                        powers a few days ago, in a memorandum which I had submitted to them
                        individually, a copy of which I inclose herewith for your consideration.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese minister fully approved of the suggestions contained in my
                        proposal, and submitted the advisability of an international committee being
                        appointed to carry out the revision of the tariff on the lines indicated by
                        me. Until the completion of the work of this committee import dues would be
                        levied on an ad valorem basis.</p>
                    <p>The British minister objected to any partial reduction of the likin. His
                        Government, he said, would only consider the total abolition of the whole
                        system, besides a number of other compensations, including <pb n="228"
                            xml:id="pg_228" facs="0234"/>river improvements on the Shanghai and
                        Tientsin rivers, and also on the Yangtze, protection of trade-marks, and
                        probably other questions, as compensation for the increase of import duties
                        to 10 per cent. He objected, furthermore, to my proposition for the reason
                        that part of the likin was already pledged for the payments on account of
                        the Anglo-German loan of 1898., and that the transit dues, of which I ask
                        suppression, were also hypothecated with the general revenues of the
                        customs.</p>
                    <p>He contended also that the elevation of the tariff on imports would not
                        supply sufficient revenues to pay the annual sums needed, which will amount
                        to a little under 19,000,000 taels. The salt revenue offered by the Chinese
                        Government seemed to him to be the best fund to apply to this purpose, and
                        offered sufficient security.</p>
                    <p>In view of the strong opposition I met with on the part of the British
                        minister to consider any partial abolition of the likin, and of the general
                        disinclination on the part of all my colleagues to avail themselves of the
                        opportunity offered them now to settle any of the questions affecting trade,
                        I felt compelled to accept the revenues offered us on the salt gabelle, to
                        wit, 11,000,000 taels a year. These, added to the amount which will probably
                        be derived from the native customs at the treaty ports when placed under
                        control of the Maritime Customs, plus the available balances in the hands of
                        the Maritime Customs, will make up a sum of 17,000,000 taels a year.</p>
                    <p>All the ministers agreed, furthermore, with the exception of myself, to raise
                        the tariff on imports to 5 per cent effective ad valorem. This will give
                        about 2,000,000 taels a year additional. This I declined to agree to, and
                        stated that the commercial compensations we would ask would be the same as
                        if the tariff were raised to 10 per cent. Finally, to bring the matter to a
                        close, I agreed to accept, subject to your approval, and as compensation for
                        our accepting a 5 per cent effective: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>That the present customs dues on imports should be converted from
                                ad valorem into specific ones, and that an international commission
                                should be appointed for this purpose; pending the results of this
                                work all customs duties on imports shall continue to be levied on ad
                                valorem basis;</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The improvement of the waterways leading up to Shanghai and
                                Tientsin, with the financial participation in this work of the
                                Chinese Government; and</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>That the regulations at present in force concerning inland
                                navigation by foreigners for purpose of trade should be revised so
                                as to open this trade to all classes of shipping.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>This latter provision met with the strongest opposition from the Russian
                        minister, who opposed it because it tended to reopen discussion at a moment
                        when it was most desirable to bring negotiations to a close. * * * The
                        revision I asked for would be of great value to Great Britain, Germany,
                        France, and Japan, and would tend to improve trade generally. I inserted it
                        more to secure the support of my colleagues from those countries on the
                        other points than for any direct advantage our trade would derive from it. *
                        * *</p>
                    <p>The revision of the tariff on the lines indicated is one of the desiderata
                        you mentioned to me in your telegram of April 11 last, as is also the
                        revision of the inland navigation rules and the conservancy work on the
                        rivers. I trust, therefore, that my action may meet with your approval. I
                        regret deeply, however, that more could not be done for <pb n="229"
                            xml:id="pg_229" facs="0235"/>trade interests at the present moment, but
                        all my colleagues are instructed to keep the settlement of the indemnity
                        question separate from commercial ones. This, of course, will ultimately
                        prove detrimental to a satisfactory settlement of the latter, for a powerful
                        leverage on China will be lost.</p>
                    <p>The Russian minister submitted his proposal concerning the eventual increase
                        of the tariff on imports in the following terms, which met with no objection
                        from the representatives of the powers, and which I submit to you, subject
                        to your approval. It is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The diplomatic corps proposes that in case of irregularity in payment
                                on the part of China the deferred payments on account of the loan
                                shall be guaranteed by the eventual raising of the customs dues on
                                imports up to 10 per cent. In this case the increase of revenue thus
                                produced would be entirely applied to the loan.</p>
                            <p>It is nevertheless understood that each Government shall have the
                                right to formulate its reserves when the discussion of the eventual
                                increase of the duties on imports above 5 per cent ad valorem is
                                about to be undertaken.</p>

                        <p>The commission charged with studying the question of the payment of
                            indemnities, after devoting its attention to an examination of the
                            various Chinese revenues which might be used for that purpose and
                            inquiring into the methods of administration and the possibility of
                            exercising any control over them, expressed the opinion that “le revenu
                            le plus sûr de la Chine est constitué par les douanes maritimes sous le
                            controle d’ une administration étrangère. Les événements de 1900 en ont
                            montré la solidité.” * * *</p>
                        <p>If, as is the case, other Chinese revenues than those collected by the
                            maritime customs must be applied to the payment of the interest on the
                            indemnities, and if the powers remain absolutely opposed to any foreign
                            interference in the administrasion of China’s revenues, then the only
                            guaranty we can possibly get, and guaranty we should have, that the
                            pledged revenues will be honestly collected and devoted to the purpose
                            of the debt, is to place them under the absolute control of this
                            reliable service.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of the powers and the Chinese Government are in
                            agreement that the customs duties on native shipping shall be collected
                            and the service generally managed at all open ports by the maritime
                            customs. It is confidently expected that in their hands this revenue
                            will amount to nearly 5,000,000 taels, which, if we may judge by the
                            success which has attended its collection at Kowloon and Lappa by the
                            foreign customs, may be still considerably increased, perhaps doubled or
                            trebled, within a few years.</p>
                        <p>It has been furthermore suggested by the Chinese Government, and most of
                            the representatives of the powers accepted the suggestion—in principle
                            at least—that the customs tariff on foreign imports should be raised to
                            an effective 5 per cent ad valorem. But if this measure were agreed to
                            by all the treaty powers, it would still only produce a fraction of the
                            sum annually needed to meet the payments on account of interest on the
                            indemnities—over 65 per cent of the amount would still have to be
                            provided for.</p>
                        <p>Another suggestion made is that the customs dues on imports should be
                            raised to 10 per cent. Basing the calculation on the average returns for
                            the last three years (1898–1900), and excluding from its operation rice
                            and opium, we find this would probably yield an annual increase of
                            11,500,000 taels, which, added to the unassigned balance of revenue of
                            the Maritime Customs, plus the customs on native shipping, would produce
                            very nearly 18,000,000 taels a year, the amount which will probably be
                            needed for the payments on account of interest on the indemnities. If
                            this amount should fall short in the next few years, while the
                            administration is being organized, it is always possible to take the
                            small balance needed from the salt gabelle, or such other source as the
                            Chinese Government might agree to pledge for this eventuality. But, for
                            the reasons stated above, this seems highly improbable, and it is
                            expected that a large surplus will be derived from these sources in a
                            few years.</p>

                        <p>The raising of the import duties to an effective 5 per cent ad valorem,

                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“A sum of 10,000 taels should be paid by the Chinese Government for each

                            desecrated, and 5,000 taels for each one of those which may be in the

                        <p>It appears that of the cemeteries which were desecrated in the capital
                            there are five of the French outside of the Fou Cheng gate at Teng Kung,
                            Cha-la and Cheng Fu Ssu, and the sum to be paid is 50,000 taels. There
                            is a cemetery of the British outside of the western wicket gate, and the
                            sum to be paid is 10,000 taels. Further, 10,000 taels is to be paid for
                            the desecration of the Russian cemetery outside of the An Ting gate.</p>
                        <p>Some time ago I had an interview with Sir Ernest Satow, the British
                            minister, and M. Pichon, the French minister, and it was ascertained by
                            me that the money to erect expiatory monuments in the British and French
                            cemeteries should be sent to the British and French legations. These
                            amounts are not included in the <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0238"
                            />indemnity. I do not know as yet what cemeteries were desecrated at
                            Tung Chou, Tientsin, and in the provinces. I am charged with arranging
                            missionary cases, and these are nearly settled. I propose to request the
                            Chinese plenipotentiaries, Prince Ching and Li Hung-chang, to
                            memorialize the Throne, asking that the money be appropriated for the
                            erection of expiatory monuments in the cemeteries in the capital, and
                            thus settle these cases. I do not know when the list (referred to above)
                            from the representatives of the powers will be sent or whether the
                            matter will be left to me to investigate and request an appropriation to
                            meet the claims.</p>
                        <p>I ask that your excellency will confer with your colleagues in this
                            business and favor me with a reply. I ask, furthermore, that the amounts
                            necessary for repairs to the cemeteries shall be included in the amount
                            for indemnity.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit herewith, for
                        your information, copies of the correspondence exchanged between the
                        representatives of the powers and the Chinese plenipotentiaries concerning
                        the carrying out of the terms of Article VII of the Joint Note, which
                        provided for the creation of a defensible diplomatic quarter in Peking,
                        within the limits of which the Chinese were not to reside. (Inclosures
                        1–5.)</p>
                    <p>As the question now stands, the Chinese Government has agreed to cede the
                        right of occupancy of all the ground owned by it or its subjects within the
                        limits indicated to the powers collectively, to form a defensible diplomatic
                        quarter, undertaking, furthermore, to compensate its subjects whom it may
                        have to expropriate for that purpose.</p>
                    <p>The representatives of the powers directly after the occupation of the city
                        by the foreign forces reached an agreement among themselves as to the ground
                        each required for the extension and defense of their respective legation or
                        for the erection of a new one, the legally vested rights of foreign private
                        owners within the limits being, of course, recognized.</p>
                    <p>The action of the representative of the United States was reported to you by
                        Mr. Conger in his dispatch No. 438, of November 3, 1900, and No. 558, of
                        March 4, 1901.</p>
                    <p>In the former dispatch Mr. Conger says that he presumes that under our policy
                        the land set aside in the aforesaid arrangement between the foreign
                        representatives, if taken by the United States, “will be paid for either to
                        the Chinese owners or credited upon account against the Chinese Government
                        for indemnity.”</p>
                    <p>A commission composed of interpreters of legations and delegates appointed by
                        the Chinese plenipotentiaries was organized at the request of the foreign
                        representatives (see inclosures 6–11), and has been for some time past
                        occupied in examining and recording the proofs of ownership of Chinese
                        subjects to land within the diplomatic quarter, and to whom the Chinese
                        Government is to pay an indemnity for their property.</p>
                    <p>The United States might, if it sees fit, credit the, Chinese Government with
                        such sums as it may ultimately pay under the decision of this commission to
                        Chinese property owners within the limits of our section of the diplomatic
                        quarter. This method seems preferable to buying directly from the present
                        owners of this ground, which course seems, at present at least, very
                        difficult to follow. The former plan appears also <pb n="233"
                            xml:id="pg_233" facs="0239"/>to conform to your instruction to me that
                        the sum demanded of China ($25,000,000) covered all claims of whatever
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>In his dispatch No. 558, of March 4 last, Mr. Conger says that— <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p rend="flushleft">he has designated tracts in the vicinity of the
                                legation’s present residence which will be ample for the purposes of
                                a new legation. * * * It is, however, probable that in the portion
                                of the quarter allotted to the United States legation there will be
                                a few desirable lots beyond the requirements of the legation, which,
                                of course, citizens of the United States have the first right to
                                purchase.</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>Unless the Chinese Government makes a complete cession or lease in perpetuity
                        to the power sof this quarter of the city, the latter, it seems to me, can
                        not put it to any use but that specified—legations and the purposes of their
                        defense. Should any one of them at any time decide not to occupy the whole
                        of the section of the quarter set aside by mutual arrangement between the
                        powers for its use, the property must revert to the other powers for their
                        use, the title always remaining in the Chinese Government. Under the present
                        arrangement the United States Government might allow occupancy to its
                        nationals of a portion of its section for such purposes as it might deem
                        necessary or expedient. I note, however, the Department’s views on this
                        subject contained in the last paragraph of its instructions to me—No. 23, of
                        May 3, 1901.</p>
                    <p>For the above reasons it would seem that the legation is wrong in supposing
                        that citizens of the United States have the right to buy such lots in the
                        American section as may not be needed for its use.</p>
                    <p>I respectfully request that this legation be instructed at as early a date as
                        possible as to your views on the following points: <list>
                            <item>First. Will the United States Government credit the Chinese
                                Government on the amount of the indemnity with the amount paid by it
                                to its expropriated subjects within our section of the quarter, or
                                does it wish to buy directly from the owners?</item>
                            <item>Second. Does the Government wish that a formal cession should be
                                made by China to it of the ground comprised in our section of the
                                diplomatic quarter?</item>
                            <item>Third. What disposition do you wish made of the land within our
                                section not necessary for legation purposes?</item>
                        </list>

                            Joint Note accepted by His Majesty the Emperor of China grants to each
                            power the right to organize a permanent guard for its legation and to
                            make defensible the diplomatic quarter, in which Chinese shall not have
                            the right to reside.</p>
                        <p>In your memorandum of the 16th of January you were pleased to ask us
                            concerning this subject where would commence and where would finish the
                            diplomatic quarter.</p>
                        <p>You add: “The Government offices and public buildings which may happen to
                            be situated within it should be left outside its limits. This quarter
                            should be delimitated with us, so that we may ask the inhabitants to
                            leave it.” I have the honor to inform you that the representatives of
                            the powers have fixed the limits of the diplomatic quarter by the

                                Ching and Li Hung Chang, conjointly, on the subject of the legation
                                quarter, dated March 2, 1901.</hi></head>
                        <p>On the 1st instant we received a communication from the doyen,
                            accompanied by a plan, stating that the foreign representatives had
                            decided upon the area to be set apart as the legation quarter, and
                            denned the four boundaries of the same; that the public offices and
                            buildings therein situated must be transferred elsewhere, and that the
                            question of compensating the Chinese inhabitants thereof, who must also
                            remove themselves and who are to be expropriated, is reserved for a
                            subsequent communication.</p>
                        <p>As regards the Chinese residing in this quarter who have to remove
                            themselves elsewhere, it is, in the interest of justice and equity,
                            imperative that later on regulations for indemnifying them in respect of
                            their removal, expenses, and the value of their land be drawn up.</p>
                        <p>In the memorandum of February 5, which we handed to you, we asked for
                            particulars as to where the legation quarter commenced and where it
                            ended. We stated that all offices and buildings situated therein ought
                            to be considered part of the same, and pointed out the necessity of
                            having a joint delimitation of its boundaries.</p>
                        <p>A careful perusal, however, of the plan accompanying the Doyen’s
                            communication shows us that the Tang Tzu, important ground where the
                            Emperor is wont to sacrifice, has been included within the limits, which
                            also embrace the following public offices and buildings:</p>
                        <p>The Imperial clan Court, the Boards of civil office, revenue, rites, war
                            and works, the Mongolian Superintendency, the Hanlin College, the
                            Imperial supervisorate of instruction, the Court of the Imperial stud
                            and of state ceremonial, the Imperial Board of astronomy, the Carriage
                            park, the Residence for tributary envoys, and the College devoted to the
                            students of the Hanlin bachelors. All the above-named places are
                            essential to the carrying on of public business.</p>
                        <p>Ever since Peking was made the capital the various public offices have
                            been established inside the Cheng Yang gate (the Chien Men), on the
                            right and left of the Imperial city. They are in immediate proximity to
                            and form a circle around the same.</p>
                        <p>Not only does the fact of their being adjacent (to the palace) facilitate
                            the dispatch of public business; it is a question intimately affecting
                            the prestige and the dignity of the state. This arrangement has remained
                            without change throughout the Yuan and Ming dynasties, a period of now
                            more than five hundred years. The magnitude of the building operations
                            and the number of public servants, high and low, have also to be
                            considered, and were a transfer insisted upon there would be no other
                            site available. Moreover, the Tang Tzu and these various public offices
                            and buildings are comparatively far away from the legations. Regarded
                            from a legation point of view, their exclusion from the legation quarter
                            would have no harmful results, whereas their inclusion therein would
                            deprive the capital city of all that goes to constitute a capital. The
                            action proposed involves consequences of no trifling import to the
                            dignity of the state and the hope of the people.</p>
                        <p>Were we lightly and inconsiderately to acquiesce therein it is to be
                            feared that their majesties the Empress Dowager and Emperor would, on
                            their return, visit us with censure of the severest kind. It is of a
                            truth really impossible for us to take so heavy a load upon our
                            shoulders.</p>
                        <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0241"/>
                        <p>It is accordingly incumbent upon us to pray yon in the terms of our
                            former memorandum to agree to consider these buildings as not included
                            in the legation quarter.</p>
                        <p>To accede to our request would afford ample evidence that the foreign
                            ministers plenipotentiary are in sympathy with the sincere desire to
                            strengthen friendly relations which animates our Government.</p>
                        <p>That you will do so is of a truth most fervently hoped by us.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister and Dear Dean</hi>: The commission on
                            the diplomatic quarter has the honor to inform you of the results of the
                            conferences which it had on the 22d of April with the Chinese
                            plenipotentiaries to consider the questions brought up in the draft note
                            which they handed us on the 2d of last March.</p>
                        <p>The commission in the first place informed the Chinese plenipotentiaries
                            that the diplomatic corps had decided to insist on the boundaries for
                            the legation quarters indicated in the letter which you sent them on the
                            1st of March, but that it was ready to make a concession as to the
                            western boundary, on condition that the Chinese Government should no
                            longer insist on the other, objections made in the above-mentioned
                            note.</p>
                        <p>This concession would consist in bringing back the line <hi rend="italic"
                                >a b</hi> to within a certain distance of Gazelee road, so as to
                            leave the Chinese Government the four ministries situated between
                            Gazelee road and the Chien Men, to wit, the bureau of the Imperial’
                            household and the ministries of the interior, of finance, and of rites.
                            We did not fail to add that this concession could only be made in case
                            of the Chinese Government undertaking not to allow any native dwellings
                            on the ground situated between Gazelee road and the Chien Men, with the
                            exception of those of the Chinese servants of the legations, who were to
                            be expropriated from their former dwellings in the diplomatic
                            quarter.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese plenipotentiaries would prefer to leave this ground entirely
                            free of any buildings with the exception of the four above-mentioned
                            yamens, but they would be ready to leave the settlement of these details
                            to the mixed commission of interpreters and Chinese delegates.</p>
                        <p>Prince Ching insisted very much that we should give up the idea of having
                            demolished the yellow wall of the Imperial palace situated to the north
                            of the British legation, as it would destroy the symmetry of the palace.
                            All our objections did not succeed in making him accept the decision of
                            the diplomatic corps on this point, but finally he seemed ready to
                            recommend to the Court the project of substituting an iron railing for
                            this wall. The commission undertook to submit this proposition to the
                            diplomatic corps.</p>
                        <p>The opposition of Prince Ching to the tearing down of a part of the
                            Bureau of Mongol affairs, so as to make the glacis on the north, was
                            also very strong. He finished, however, by giving in in favor of the
                            military exigencies of the case which we submitted to him, but asked
                            that the prohibition of buildings, or of depositing building materials
                            on the glacis, should extend to foreigners as well as to natives, and
                            that the ownership of the ground on that part of the glacis situated to
                            the north of the street should remain vested in the Chinese, and that
                            the Chinese police should be permitted to exercise its duties on the
                            glacis, while observing the regulations elaborated by the diplomatic
                            corps.</p>
                        <p>The most serious objections were made to us concerning the Tang Tzu
                            (ancestral temple), as the relinquishment of this spot to foreigners
                            would be considered, according to Prince Ching, as a serious blow to the
                            dignity of the dynasty.</p>
                        <p>The Prince, proposed to give in exchange to the Italian legation the
                            ground belonging to the customs, which the inspector-in-chief had
                            declared he was ready to cede if this legation would give up the Tang
                            Tzu. We observed that the two buildings in the north part of this
                            inclosure would have to be pulled down for necessity of defense, but the
                            prince insisted on his proposition, being satisfied to occupy that part
                            of the Tang Tzu which would remain to the south of the wall.</p>
                        <p>We deemed it necessary to submit this proposition to the diplomatic
                            corps, while asking at the same time the Prince to be pleased to consult
                            the Court and to propose to it to transfer the temple of ancestors
                            entirely outside the diplomatic quarter, as this seemed much more
                            compatible with the dignity of the dynasty. The delimitation of the
                            diplomatic quarter on the east side caused no objection, and as to the
                                <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0242"/>wall of the Tartar city,
                            the prince finally agreed that the portion extending between the Hata
                            Men and the Chien Men should remain occupied by the legations, only
                            demanding that houses should not be built on it, and that nothing should
                            be done to change its present aspect. This we considered ourselves
                            justified in promising.</p>
                        <p>Begging you to communicate the above to the diplomatic corps, we avail
                            ourselves of this opportunity, etc.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: On the 22d of April we had a
                            conference with the French, Austrian, and Italian plenipotentiaries, at
                            which we discussed the question of the legation quarter in Peking. With
                            the exception of the Tang Tzu (Imperial ancestral hall), which place has
                            been surrendered by decree of His Majesty the Emperor—of which fact we
                            have duly notified the Italian minister, Marquis Salvago Raggi, by
                            note—the question of the four boundaries and other matters agreed upon,
                            we now write to you about officially, so that a record by both the
                            foreign representatives and ourselves may be kept.</p>
                        <list>

                            <item>The eastern boundary is 10 chang (100 feet) from the Tsung Wen
                                gate (Hata Men). The ramp to the west of the gate for ascending the
                                wall is not included within the legation quarter.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The northern boundary extends to the Ping Pu Chieh (Board of War
                                street). On the west side of this street there are the yamens of the
                                Imperial clan court, the Board of civil office, the Board of
                                revenue, and the Board of rites. These yamens are to be handed over
                                to the Chinese Government. At the rear of these yamens a wall, not
                                very high, is to be built. At the side of the yamens there are
                                houses of Chinese, many of which have been burned, while others
                                remain intact. These are to be entirely taken down and the ground
                                converted into vacant land. Neither Chinese nor foreigners will be
                                allowed to use this land to build houses thereon. Chinese servants
                                employed in the foreign legations, who originally had houses in this
                                section, will be given other land on which they can build
                                residential places.</item>

                            <item>The boundary to the south extends to the city wall. The wall
                                adjoining the legations is to be patrolled by a guard of police
                                dispatched for that purpose by the various legations, but no houses
                                are to be erected on the wall.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>The northern boundary extends to 80 meters north of the Tung
                                Chang-an street. The boundary walls of the foreign legations are to
                                be erected 15 chang (150 feet) south of the Tung Chang-an street.
                                The houses on the land from the boundary walls of the legations to
                                the point north of the Tung Chang-an street are to be pulled down
                                and the place converted into vacant ground. The Imperial city wall,
                                however, is not to be disturbed. No houses, in the future, will be
                                allowed to be erected on said vacant ground, either by Chinese or
                                foreigners. The Tung Chang-an street is to remain open, as a public
                                road, to carts and horses as before. The Chinese Government will
                                establish police stations there and employ policemen to patrol the
                                street.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The above four boundaries and other matters decided upon were arranged
                            verbally at the meeting on the day in question.</p>
                        <p>We have the honor, therefore, to address this communication to your

                                    the diplomatic quarter shall be comprised within it. Therefore
                                    the representatives of the powers, as the commission stated to
                                    you, reserve to themselves the right to maintain on it police

                        <p>We have also to recall to you that the foreign representatives had asked

                            down, and so as to conciliate this request with your wishes the

                            the court the plan of substituting an iron railing for this wall. It is
                            so as to facilitate to the Chinese Government the pulling down of this
                            wall that his excellency the British minister has agreed to relinquish
                            the two yamens facing his lot.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Highness and Excellency</hi>: As I informed you in
                            my letter dated March 1, the foreign plenipotentiaries, considering the
                            carrying out of Article VII of the Joint Note, have resolved to ask the
                            Chinese Government to indemnify all the Chinese property Owners whose
                            expulsion from the diplomatic quarter has been decided upon.</p>
                        <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0244"/>
                        <p>To that end they have named a committee charged with making an inquiry
                            into the validity of property titles and the value of ground. So as to
                            carry out this inquest with all necessary guaranties for the interested
                            parties, the foreign plenipotentiaries think it desirable to have added
                            to this committee a Chinese official who will assist it with his
                            experience.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: We had the honor to receive,
                            on the 15th instant, your communication with reference to the execution
                            of Article VII of the Joint Note. [Quotes <hi rend="italic">in
                                extenso</hi> doyen’s note of March 15, 1901.]</p>
                        <p>In your communication of the 1st instant, transmitting a plan of the
                            proposed legation quarter, you made certain remarks on the subject of
                            the Chinese residents within its limits.</p>
                        <p>On receipt thereof we prepared and sent you a memorandum, in which we
                            stated that in the interest of justice steps must be taken to make good
                            to the Chinese residents in the legation quarter who would be called
                            upon to move elsewhere the value of their land and their expenses of
                            removal.</p>
                        <p>Now, what we meant thereby was that the plenipotentiaries of the powers
                            themselves ought, as a matter of course, to take steps to provide any
                            sums necessary to make good such claims. It is a fixed and abiding
                            principle that he who appropriates land for his own use must pay for the
                            same and that he who calls on them to remove their dwellings must make
                            good the expenses of such removal. In the present instance, as the
                            legations wish to extend their boundaries, such Chinese as are resident
                            within these limits must move elsewhere, and as in your former
                            communication it is stated that such area is reserved for the use of the
                            legations, it undoubtedly follows that the legations are responsible for
                            the payment of the value of the land thus appropriated. Further, as the
                            legations had called upon the present residents to quit, they put these
                            people to the expense of taking down their dwellings and reerecting
                            them, a process which is accompanied by inevitable loss of property and
                            damage of various kinds. These losses being the result of orders to
                            quit, the reimbursement thereof ought naturally also to be made by the
                            legations concerned.</p>
                        <p>It is now, however, proposed that the Chinese Government be asked to
                            provide funds for this purpose. Taking all the circumstances into
                            consideration, we can hardly bring ourselves to believe that a proposal
                            of this kind is in accordance with equity.</p>
                        <p>As regards the request in the communication under acknowledgment that an
                            officer be appointed to assist in the examination of title deeds and
                            assessment of values, this is, of a truth, a just and proper method of
                            procedure and affords evidence of a really sincere desire to preserve
                            the interests of the proprietor from injury.</p>
                        <p>It is our duty in addressing to you this reply to beg you to consult with
                            the plenipotentiaries of the powers regarding the question of refunding
                            to the Chinese owners the value of their land and expenses of removal,
                            with a view to securing an acknowledgment of the just principle that
                            each legation should itself take steps to provide the funds necessary
                            for the purpose.</p>
                        <p>When we shall have received your answer we will take into consideration
                            the appointment of a delegate to join the committee elected by the
                            diplomatic body.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Highness and Your Excellency</hi>: In a note
                            under date of the 15th of March I had the honor to request you to
                            designate a delegate to examine, with a commission named for that
                            purpose by the representatives of the powers, the validity of deeds to
                            real estate, owned by Chinese within the limits of the future diplomatic
                            quarter. I <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0245"/>informed yon that
                            this commission and the delegate you will choose would also have for
                            duty to fix the value of the lots to be expropriated, so as to settle
                            the damages which the Imperial Government would have to grant the owners
                            of them.</p>
                        <p>You answered me on the 16th of this month that it belonged to the
                            legations to indemnify the Chinese who would be expropriated by them.
                            You pretended in that communication that the pulling down and
                            destruction of buildings which has been done in the diplomatic quarter
                            were imputable to the legations, as was also the moving away from it of
                            the inhabitants who have been obliged to abandon their dwellings.</p>
                        <p>The events of last year are still too recent for it to be possible to
                            represent things in this light.</p>
                        <p>Why did the Emperor of China, in accepting the Joint Note, grant to the
                            legations the right to put themselves in a defensive state, unless it
                            was because they had been invested and besieged for two months,
                            surrounded by regulars and Boxers, who pulled down several of the
                            legations and destroyed by fire the whole quarter surrounding them?</p>
                        <p>Who ignores that when the allied troops entered into Peking the whole
                            section of the city which the powers demand to establish their
                            diplomatic missions in had been mined and burned and was only a heap of
                            ruins—the work of Boxers and regulars?</p>
                        <p>It is the Chinese Government, declared responsible for these events by
                            the powers, and which had recognized itself as such in accepting their
                            conditions; it is for it to bear the consequences of its conduct, and to
                            supply to the diplomatic agents the means of defense it has rendered
                            necessary in failing to keep its first obligations. Among these means of
                            defense figure in first line the removing of the houses which served as
                            a place of refuge to those attacking the legations and the walls of
                            which have shielded their attacks against the representatives of the
                            powers.</p>
                        <p>As, however, it would be unjust to deprive of their dwellings Chinese who
                            have no responsibility in the affair, and who would as a result be
                            victims of an event which they could not prevent, the diplomatic corps
                            proposes to you to fix with it the reasonable damages which you will
                            have to pay the inhabitants who can show good titles to their
                            property.</p>
                        <p>The diplomatic corps can only insist on its demand, and my colleagues
                            have directed me to beg you to designate as soon as possible the
                            delegate who will put himself in communication with the commission which
                            they have appointed.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: On the 29th day of the first
                            moon, of the 27th year of Kuang Hsu (March 19, 1901), we received your
                            dispatch informing us that the diplomatic corps could only adhere to its
                            proposition for us to take part with it in establishing the equitable
                            indemnities which China would have to give to the expropriated
                            inhabitants who could produce satisfactory title deeds to property, and
                            that the diplomatic corps have charged you to request us to designate,
                            as soon as possible, a delegate who should put himself in communication
                            with the commission appointed by it.</p>
                        <p>In reply, we would note that, according to international law, war is an
                            act between two nations, in which the populations are not concerned;
                            that the victorious government has a right to seize public property, but
                            not the right of seizing private property; that, nevertheless, the
                            victorious country can occupy for its use private property, but
                            naturally on the condition to pay the value of it to the former
                            owner.</p>
                        <p>Your dispatch admits also that there is cause for indemnifying the former
                            owner for the value of his private property, but it declares that it
                            should be paid by the Chinese, and that is not just. It is perfectly
                            clear that he who uses a piece of ground should pay the price of this
                            ground, as we have explained in detail in our previous reply.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, article 7 of the protocol of peace negotiations only
                            stipulated the right for each power to establish a guard for its
                            legation and to put in a state of defense the diplomatic quarter, and it
                            was in no wise stated in it that it was possible to extend at one’s will
                            the limits, or that they could, according to their convenience, encroach
                            on the property of the people.</p>
                        <p>If, therefore, the legations occupy for their use the houses and the
                            ground belonging to Chinese subjects and situated within the limits of
                            the quarter actually laid out, it would naturally be proper, in
                            compliance with equity, that the price should be paid by the
                            legations.</p>
                        <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0246"/>
                        <p>Nevertheless, desirous as we, the prince and minister, are to treat in a
                            satisfactory manner the various articles of the convention, in case the
                            diplomatic corps should consent to promptly reach an understanding with
                            us in conformity with the propositions of the memorandum which we have
                            addressed to it previously on the question of the restitution of the
                            Tang-tzu and various important yamens, it would not be difficult for us
                            to endeavor to accede to the desire of the diplomatic corps in promising
                            to pay the price of the loss and in designating an able delegate to whom
                            would be intrusted the question of regulating in a satisfactory manner,
                            in conjunction with the commission, the examination of title deeds and
                            various questions.</p>
                        <p>Such is the answer which we send you, Monsieur the dean, requesting you
                            to kindly bring it to the knowledge of the diplomatic corps.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Highness and Excellency</hi>: The representatives of
                            the powers take note of the declarations contained in your dispatch of
                            the 23d of this month, by which you agree, in principle, to indemnify
                            the Chinese who shall be expropriated from the diplomatic quarter, and
                            to designate a delegate to discuss this question with the committee
                            appointed for that purpose by the diplomatic corps.</p>
                        <p>The considerations which you have laid down, however, in your dispatch,
                            before reaching this conclusion, can not be accepted. It is not, as you
                            seem to believe, by right of conquest that the foreign ministers have
                            seized private property situated within the limits of the quarter to be
                            ceded under the terms of Article VII of the Joint Note accepted by His
                            Majesty the Emperor of China. It is because the annexation of these
                            properties is indispensable for the future defense of the diplomatic
                            quarter, and because they were used as a refuge by the regulars and
                            Boxers who attacked the legations for two months.</p>
                        <p>While noting, as is proper, the passage of your dispatch in which you
                            admit that it is lawful for the representatives of the powers to dispose
                            of the public buildings within the limits fixed by my letter of the 1st
                            of March to your highness and your excellency, and while willing to seek
                            with you a compromise on this point, my colleagues call your attention
                            to the fact that a state of war does not exist and has never existed
                            during last year between China and the governments whose
                            plenipotentiaries they are.</p>
                        <p>What happened was an attempted general massacre of foreigners and of the
                            members of the diplomatic body by Boxers and Chinese regulars, obeying
                            orders emanating from the Imperial palace. As a result, the Government
                            of His Majesty the Emperor of China admitted its liability for this
                            attempt, and declared itself ready to grant both reparation and the
                            guarantee deemed indispensable by the powers. The erection of a quarter
                            provided with means of defense against the recurrence of a criminal
                            attempt like the one which only failed through the arrival of the allied
                            troops at Peking is one of these guarantees. The Chinese Government owes
                            it entirely to the foreign governments and to their ministers in China
                            without any compensation on their part.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor, in consequence, to reaffirm to your highness and your
                            excellency the necessity of designating at once a delegate to enter into
                            relations on this subject with the committee to negotiate the question
                            with you.</p>

                            honor to receive your excellency’s dispatch wherein you requested us to
                            at once designate a delegate to examine, with a commission named for

                            named by the foreign representatives. As this matter concerns interests
                            in the locality named, the gendarmerie and governor of Peking have also
                            selected military and civil officers (the latter the magistrate of Ta
                            Hsing district) to act with the above-named officers, in the hope that

                    <p>Your dispatch speaks of “the legally vested rights of foreign private owners
                        with in the limits (of the legation) being of course recognized.”</p>
                    <p>The Department is not sure that it understands what “vested rights of foreign
                        private owners” are referred to. If any such right had legally vested prior
                        to the siege they should be respected, but Pekin not being a treaty port
                        where foreigners might purchase land at will, the Department is in doubt
                        whether the rights above mentioned are supposed rights of foreigners in land
                        purchased during the siege of the legations. If such rights are meant the
                        attitude of the Department in relation thereto is indicated in its previous
                        instructions.</p>
                    <p>Your dispatch states that— <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p rend="flushleft">the Chinese Government has agreed to cede the rights
                                of occupancy of all the ground owned by it or its subjects within
                                the limits indicated to the powers collectively, to form a defensive
                                diplomatic quarter, undertaking, furthermore, to compensate its
                                subjects whom (whose property) it may have to expropriate for that
                                purpose.</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>Such agreement for compensation by the Chinese Government would exonerate
                        this Government from such obligation, and no deduction on that account would
                        need to be made from the indemnity agreed upon.</p>
                    <p>In reading the inclosures with your dispatch the Department does not find any
                        express undertaking by the Chinese Government to compensate its subjects
                        whose property it may expropriate. While this demand was made by the foreign
                        envoys, the answer does not appear to be fully responsive to the demand so
                        as to constitute a clear acceptance, <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0248"
                        />and its acceptance can only be deduced from the tenor of the notes
                        preceding the demand coupled with the answer thereto, and which, taken
                        altogether, may perhaps be considered as a constrained acceptance.</p>
                    <p>This is a question of agreement or of interpretation which should be settled
                        by the envoys with the representatives of the Chinese Government. If the
                        cession of this property is made on the grounds asserted by the envoys, not
                        as a conquest, but as a security against future attacks, it would seem to
                        exclude the idea of reimbursing the Chinese Government, either for the
                        cession of its property or for payments made for the expropriation of the
                        property of its subjects for such purpose. But if, on the other hand, the
                        result of such interpretation should be to leave incumbent upon the powers
                        the duty of making compensation to China for sums paid by it for the
                        expropriation of the property of its subjects, the amount thereof which
                        would be payable to China on account of the cession of the property of its
                        subjects to this Government may be credited on the share of the indemnity
                        which would come to the United States, and the amount thus credited should,
                        on final distribution by the United States, be deducted from the share which
                        would come to it, as distinguished from and so as to leave unimpaired the
                        share which comes to it in trust for private claimants.</p>
                    <p>For the present no disposition should be made of any land “within our section
                        not necessary for legation purposes.” You may send a chart to the
                        Department, showing the figure and area of the land above ceded as above
                        indicated, and showing the portion and quantity thereof to be used for
                        United States legation purposes, and showing the residue and its quantity
                        available for other purposes. If the residue can properly and advantageously
                        be used in connection with legation purposes it should be reserved for such
                        uses, present or future. If not, and if it is proposed and there is an
                        opportunity to make other disposition of it, all the pertinent facts in
                        connection with such disposition and use should be reported to the
                        Department, to aid in its determination of the question of the right and
                        advisability of its disposition. The decision of this question may
                        ultimately largely turn on the form of the instrument of cession. And it is
                        advisable that the Chinese Government make a formal instrument of cession of
                        rights of perpetual occupancy, in accordance with the tenor of the
                        arrangement between its representatives and the envoys. The form of this
                        instrument should be carefully guarded, to avoid hampering limitations and
                        restrictions upon the disposition and uses of any of the property ceded. If
                        the property is ceded for legation purposes purely it may raise a serious
                        question as to the right of revision to the Chinese Government, or of
                        well-grounded interference by it with any attempt to make any disposition of
                        the property foreign to the object of the cession.</p>
                    <p>It would be more convenient for the Government of the United States to take
                        title to all the property by direct grant from the Chinese Government,
                        leaving to it the precedent duty of expropriating the property of its
                        subjects. This may be done unless it will conflict with the views and
                        arrangements made by the envoys.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister and Dear Colleague</hi>: As I declared
                            to my honorable colleague in the meeting of this morning, my Government
                            considers that it would be preferable to guarantee the payments of the
                            Chinese debts by taxes and duties collected in the open ports, and
                            particularly by the revenues of the customs, instead of having recourse
                            to internal taxes, which might easily lead to an intervention in the
                            internal administration of the Chinese Empire.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, in view of the difficulty surrounding an increase of
                            customs dues to 10 per cent ad valorem, and with the object of bringing
                            the question of indemnities to as prompt a settlement as possible, my
                            Government has consented, as a concession on its part, to accept as a
                            source of revenue the salt gabelle as it is in operation at present
                            under Chinese administration, and without any foreign control.</p>
                        <p>I was happy to see the unanimity which the diplomatic corps was able to
                            reach as to this source of revenue, as also on those derived from the
                            native customs and the available balances of the maritime customs.
                            Concerning these resources and the reservation made as to them, which I
                            drew up in a special formula, agreement was reached ad referendum.</p>
                        <p>As to the proposition of the German minister to add to these resources
                            the increase of the tariff on imports to a 5 per cent ad valorem
                            effective, it would also have been accepted by the diplomatic corps if
                            his excellency Mr. Rockhill had not laid down conditions. These
                            conditions present, in my point of view, the serious inconvenience of
                            reopening discussion and provoking thereby loss of time, which my
                            Government had precisely in view to obviate when accepting the salt
                            revenue as one of the sources of payment. For that reason I did not
                            think I could accept these conditions even ad referendum, holding that
                            they ought to have been sufficient to secure the acceptance of the
                            increase of the customs tariff to 10 per cent.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, as some of my honorable colleagues have shown insistence in
                            the matter, I will consent to submit to my Government, without in any
                            way prejudicing its opinion, the two following points as conditions to
                            the raising of the customs dues to 5 per cent effective: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The transformation of all duties on imports actually levied ad

                                    commission for that purpose, and, while waiting for the result
                                    of its work, the levying of ad valorem duties; and</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The improvement of the Peiho and Whangpoo rivers, with the
                                    financial participation of the Chinese Government.</item>

                        <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0250"/>
                        <p>But so as not to compromise the results already obtained, it is
                            impossible for me to submit to my Government, as a condition to the
                            raising of the tariff to 5 per cent, the revision of the regulations of
                            navigation on Chinese inland waters.</p>
                        <p>Please accept, Mr. Minister and dear colleague, the assurances of my
                            highest consideration.</p>

                        of specific for ad valorem duties and the improvement of the waterways
                        leading to Shanghai and Tientsin.</p>
                    <p>I likewise informed them that my Government, desirous of bringing to a prompt
                        close the present negotiations, accepted the sum of 450,000,000 taels as the
                        final amount of the indemnity calculated to the 1st of July, and as a
                        further manifestation of the earnestness of its desire to expedite
                        negotiations it accepted also the 4 per cent instead of 3 per cent interest,
                        which latter we had been advocating.</p>
                    <p>From the remarks made during the exchange of views which followed, there can
                        be no doubt that France and Russia accept the 450,000,000 taels indemnity,
                        although the representative of the latter power said that he had no definite
                        instructions on the subject.</p>
                    <p>The question of the mode of payment was then taken up—guaranteed loan or
                        bonds.</p>
                    <p>The Russian minister stated that his Government, although always partisan of
                        an international guaranteed loan, would accept the decision reached by all
                        the other powers. The French minister said he was authorized by his
                        Government to accept one or the other of the two modes of payment above
                        mentioned.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese minister said that, if the system of a guaranteed loan was
                        accepted, his Government would raise no objection to it, but if the payment
                        was made by the issuance of bonds at 4 per cent interest Japan would incur a
                        loss. The last Japanese loan placed on the London market was a 4 per cent
                        one, and the bonds at the present time were quoted at 0.78. The Japanese
                        minister said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Taking note, therefore, of the principle laid down in the fifth
                                section of the report of the commission on indemnities, and
                                believing it to be the intention of the powers that the actual
                                expenditure incurred by each Government in the interest of all
                                should be made good, it was his duty to declare that if the bonds
                                were to bear interest at 4 per cent nothing less than a capital sum
                                which would yield interest equal to 5 per cent on the total amount
                                of Japan’s claims should be regarded as equivalent to such claims
                                which were calculated on the basis of immediate payment.</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>All the other powers were unreservedly in favor of the issuance of bonds at
                        par, bearing 4 per cent interest.</p>
                    <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0251"/>
                    <p>Mr. Komura also remarked that the actual sum by which the face value of
                        Japan’s claim would have to be increased would be considerably less than 25
                        per cent of the whole amount, because amortization as well as interest on
                        the sum so increased would be taken into account in making good the loss of
                        1 per cent which Japan would actually incur.</p>
                    <p>The Russian minister remarked that the 4 per cent loans in his country were
                        some points below par, and that he could not therefore feel at all sure that
                        his Government would, accept the 4 per cent rate.</p>
                    <p>On the whole, the discussion established the fact that the only serious
                        objection to 4 per cent was that in the case of Japan. It was generally felt
                        that Russia’s present reserve in expressing itself definitely on the subject
                        would not be maintained.</p>
                    <p>The embarrassment of Japan is so real, and on the other hand, that country
                        deserves so much the thanks of all the others for the prompt, efficient, and
                        modest way in which it performed its work here last year, that I trust some
                        means may be devised to prevent it sustaining any loss.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>I may add that during to-day’s meeting, and also in one or two of those which
                        have preceded it, the question of the currency in which the interest and
                        amortization is to be paid was discussed. It is understood that the sum of
                        450,000,000 taels was only given to the Chinese as a convenient indication;
                        that all the claims are in gold and payable in the currency of the country
                        of the power claiming. The locality where the interest is to be paid has not
                        yet been settled. There seems, however, to be a disposition to have these
                        payments made at Shanghai.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my dispatch No. 109, of the 6th instant, I
                        transmitted to you the correspondence exchanged between the representatives
                        of the powers and the Chinese plenipotentiaries concerning the suspension of
                        examinations. The only obstacle to a final and satisfactory settlement was,
                        I therein stated, the question of the suspension of metropolitan
                        examinations, which are always held in Peking.</p>
                    <p>This obstacle has been removed by the publication of a decree of the Emperor
                        suspending all examinations in Peking and in the metropolitan prefecture
                        (Shun-t’ien Fu). I inclose a translation of a dispatch addressed by Prince
                        Ching and Li Hung-chang to the doyen of the diplomatic corps, giving the
                        text, of the decree.</p>
                    <p>I understand that it is the intention of the Chinese Government to hold the
                        metropolitan examinations, during the time Peking is closed, in some
                        provincial capital—preferable at K’ai-feng Fu.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: At the meeting of the diplomatic corps held
                        to-day the Russian minister stated that he had received instructions
                        authorizing him to accept the 1st of July as limitation of the indemnity to
                        be demanded of China. He also accepted, in principle, the sum of 450,000,000
                        taels, although his Government had invariably, in its instructions to him,
                        referred to the sum of seventeen hundred millions of francs.</p>
                    <p>The French minister made a similar declaration as to the limitation of the
                        indemnity.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese minister said that his Government accepted the date stated, and
                        also the sum of 450,000,000 taels and 4 per cent interest, subject to the
                        reservation made by him at the last meeting, which I reported to you in my
                        No. 118, of the 15th instant.</p>
                    <p>In my No. 114, of the 11th instant, I stated that the Russian minister
                        submitted a proposal concerning the eventual increase of the tariff on
                        imports to 10 per cent, and that in view of the terms of the second
                        paragraph, which reserved all rights and insured the consideration of all
                        objections of whatever nature, it had been accepted by all the <pb n="247"
                            xml:id="pg_247" facs="0253"/>representatives—the British included. I did
                        not deem it necessary to telegraph you on the subject, and most of my
                        colleagues, I think, looked on it as a matter of small importance; the
                        German and Japanese ministers certainly did.</p>
                    <p>We considered it a compensation due Russia and France, who saw in the
                        acceptance of their proposal a moral obligation giving additional security
                        for the arrangement being made, for their willingness to accept bonds in
                        lieu of the guaranteed loan they had so strongly urged until now, and the
                        gabelle in place of an increase of the tariff to 10 per cent.</p>
                    <p>To-day, however, the British minister informed the diplomatic corps that his
                        Government declared it could not accept an eventual increase of the tariff
                        above 5 per cent, to be solely applied to the payment of interest on the
                        indemnities, for it held that this increase should be granted China as
                        compensation for the suppression of likin, and for the correction of other
                        commercial grievances; that this increase should be made revocable, as in
                        the ease of opium under the Hongkong agreement, etc.</p>
                    <p>The necessity or expediency of making this declaration at the present time is
                        not apparent. The British minister had stated in the meeting on the 11th
                        instant that his Government would ask the abolition of likin and other
                        compensations for an increase of the tariff to 10 per cent, and my
                        reservations had covered much the same ground.</p>
                    <p>The Russian minister stated that his Government had only accepted applying
                        the revenues from salt to the payment of the loans, agreed to accept bonds
                        in lieu of a guaranteed loan, and to the commercial compensations which I
                        had insisted upon, as an evidence of its earnest desire to close this phase
                        of the negotiations; that the British Government’s refusal to agree to the
                        slight moral guaranty which Russia found in the proposal to apply the
                        eventual increased revenue from the customs to the purposes of the loan
                        might reopen the whole question.</p>
                    <p>The British statement did not secure the support of any of the
                        representatives. I trust it will not occasion any considerable delay, but in
                        view of the possibility of its doing so I thought best to cable you.</p>

                        information translation of a communication addressed to Sir Ernest Satow by
                        the Chinese plenipotentiaries, in which the latter state their intention to
                        bring some 3,000 troops to Peking to take over the policing of the city. An
                        identical communication was sent to the ministers of the other powers having
                        troops in this province.</p>
                    <p>I also inclose copy of the reply of the diplomatic corps to the communication
                        cited, informing the Chinese plenipotentiaries that, until further orders,
                        no Chinese troops can be allowed to advance toward Peking.</p>
                    <p>At the present time the actual work of policing the city is in the <pb
                            n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0254"/>hands of the Chinese authorities,
                        subject to the control of the various military commanders, and it would seem
                        that this was the better method of managing this work until the complete
                        evacuation of the capital by the foreign soldiery.</p>

                        <p>The allied forces are about to be gradually withdrawn from Peking, and as
                            the place will then be empty of troops we have memorialized the throne
                            asking for the transfer to Peking of General Chiang Kuei-ti and 3,000
                            troops, infantry, cavalry, and artillery, from the governor of
                            Shantung’s command, to take over the policing of the city. Yesterday we
                            addressed a communication to the doyen of the diplomatic body, stating
                            this and requesting his excellency to inform the diplomatic
                            representatives in order that instructions might be sent to the allied
                            commanders along the route (of the Shantung troops) not to hinder their
                            approach. These troops are now at Ho-chien Fu, and it is proposed that
                            they shall proceed via Kao-yang to Paoting, and then take the railway to
                            Peking, where (it is proposed) to station them in two places, both of
                            which are to be in the quarter administered by Japan and are not
                            occupied by Japanese or other foreign troops. These two places are the
                            empty inclosures formerly occupied by the Shen Chi Ying (Pekin field
                            force) in the Pei hsiao Chieh (North Small street) off the Tung-Chih men
                            main road, and Shih-hu hu-tung (Stone Tiger lane) off the Tê-sheng men
                            main road.</p>
                        <p>We have the honor accordingly to inform your excellency and to express an
                            earnest hope that you will confer with your colleagues at an early date
                            and favor us with a reply as soon as possible, in order that we may send
                            a dispatch to General Chiang instructing him to set his forces in
                            motion, and that we may fix definitely with the railway company the date
                            of the required trains.</p>

                        <p>The attached note, marked “A,” is laid before the committee, who

                        <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Forts.</hi>—It was agreed that the forts should be
                            redistributed as under, the parade grounds going with the forts: Fort 1,
                            Great Baitain; Fort 2, Germany (small guard), Austria, and Italy; Fort
                            3, France; Fort 4, Japan; Fort 5, Russia.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of France and Russia opposed this. General Pares
                            objects on the grounds that the instructions of General Voyron do not
                            permit him to change any orders made by the admirals. Colonel Glinsky
                            refuses to vote, as he considers that the instructions he has received
                            from Count von Waldersee in his letter do not refer to the redivision of
                            the forts.</p>

                            and the west portion of the village Italy now proposes to occupy.</p>

                        <p>The above proposals were accepted unanimously.</p>
                        <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Lands.</hi>—It was agreed that no nationality is to
                            construct any buildings at a distance of more than 200 yards from the
                            wall of any fort of yamen occupied by them. When the buildings of any
                            two nationalities are less than 400 yards apart, then the dividing line
                            will lie halfway between the two buildings. In the case of No. 1 fort,
                            the building rights go with the fort and not with the Russian yamen.
                            Colonels Glinsky and Pares dissent with the last point only for the
                            reasons given in clause 1.</p>

                        <p>Russia: One hundred yards to the east of the Russian pier to 50 yards to

                        <p>Italy: From the west of the Japanese limit, with a frontage of 50
                            yards.</p>
                        <p>Great Britain: From the west of the Italian limit to 50 yards to the west
                            of the British pier.</p>
                        <p>The limits to be shown by landmarks and not flags. No buildings except

                        <p>(5) <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous.</hi>—It was unanimously agreed that
                            all flags be removed, except on the forts and buildings occupied by
                            troops, railway buildings and stations, piers and the beach, for the
                            purpose of aiding navigation.</p>
                        <p>That rifle ranges may only be constructed to the east of the Great Wall
                            and the west of the main creek near Fort Count von Waldersee, firing
                            toward the sea in both cases, or to the north of the city, firing toward
                            the hills. No rifle range may be taken into use until approved by the
                            senior officer of the troops.</p>

                        <p>According to the information in my possession, the average quotation in
                            London of Japanese 4 per cent bonds for the last five months was 79.18
                            per cent, and since the 8th of May it has been invariably below 78 per
                            cent. The current quotation in Tokio of Japanese 5 per cent bonds is
                            86.20 per cent, so that the actual rate of interest on Japanese bonds is
                            above 5 per cent both at home and abroad.</p>
                        <p>Japan’s claims for indemnity having been calculated on the basis of
                            immediate payment, if she is to receive Chinese bonds bearing interest
                            at 4 per cent she will actually suffer a loss of at least 1 per cent in
                            the interest on her claims, which amounts to 50,074,000 yen up to the
                            1st of July. Consequently, if Japan’s claims are paid at once, they are
                            50,074,000 yen, but if paid on 4 per cent bonds with the system of
                            amortization adopted by the corps diplomatique, they are 57,942,247
                            yen—that is to say, an increase of 15.713 per cent of the original
                            claims, which is 7,868,247 yen, equivalent to 5,590,389 Haikwan taels at
                            the rate of Haikwan tael 0.7105 for 1 yen.</p>

                            happen that she may deem it necessary to have at Shanhaikwan a stronger
                            garrison than that indicated so as to be able to effectively insure
                            security of the head of this railway line; and for that reason she
                            declares to reserve to herself full liberty to fix the number of her
                            proportion of the garrison of Shanhaikwan to the strength which she may
                            deem necessary to discharge the duties devolving upon her.</p>
                        <p>Please accept, Monsieur le Maréchal, the assurance of my very high
                            consideration.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Article XI of the Joint Note of the 22d of
                        December last stipu lates that “The Chinese Government agrees to negotiate
                        theamendments deemed necessary by the foreign governments to the treaties
                        concerning commerce and navigation and other subjects touching commercial
                        relations, with the object of facilitating them.”</p>
                    <p>Throughout the present negotiations the representatives of the powers have
                        deemed it advisable not to broach commercial questions, reserving their
                        consideration until after the final settlement of the other articles of the
                        Joint Note. The only exception which has been made was the agreement, which
                        I secured during the recent discussions concerning the revenues to be used
                        by China in the payment of interest on indemnities, to ask of China, in
                        consideration of the increase of the tariff on imports to an effective 5 per
                        cent, that the Chinese Government should undertake the improvement of the
                        waterways leading to Shanghai and Tientsin, and also revise the customs
                        tariff on imports.</p>
                    <p>All of my colleagues are of opinion that any negotiations on commercial
                        subjects must be deferred until next winter at least, and many of them think
                        it will be quite impracticable for all the powers to negotiate jointly on
                        these subjects with the Chinese Government, most of them believing that if
                        such a plan were adopted negotiations would be greatly protracted and
                        probably no practical results obtained.</p>
                    <p>Most of the obstacles to trade, of which the American as well as other
                        foreign merchants in China complain, are so intimately connected with the
                        question of inland taxation that unless some method can be devised for
                        either abolishing the inland tax or regulating it more satisfactorily than
                        at present, it seems to me improbable that any great results can be expected
                        from a revision of our commercial treaties.</p>
                    <p>Forseeing this difficulty to future negotiations, my Japanese colleague and I
                        submitted to the diplomatic corps the memorandum, copy of which I sent you
                        in my No. 114, of the 11th instant, advocating a raising of the tariff on
                        imports to 10 per cent with compensating commercial advantages. It is a
                        matter of great regret that the opposition of the British representative
                        here prevented its discussion, for it was, in its general line, acceptable
                        to the Chinese Government and, I believe, might have secured promptly to
                        foreign commerce more advantages than it seems likely to gain for some years
                        to come, if the plan of jointly negotiating treaty revision is carried
                        out.</p>
                    <p>In your dispatch No. 20, of April 11 last, you outlined the views of the
                        United States concerning treaty revision. As instructed by you, I have
                        sounded my colleagues on the views contained in the instruction cited, and
                        while many of the points you mention therein are in entire agreement with
                        the instructions they have from their own governments <pb n="253"
                            xml:id="pg_253" facs="0259"/>and coincide with their own views, others,
                        they are inclined to think, are of doubtful expedience, or impracticable.
                        Among these latter I may mention the throwing open of the whole of China to
                        foreign residence and trade, and the provision that the principal commercial
                        powers should have advisory representation in the customs administration.
                        The extraterritorial rights of foreigners would create endless difficulties
                        to China and the powers if foreigners of all classes were given a free run
                        all over the Empire. This is but one objection to the proposal; there are
                        others of a political character, perhaps even more serious, * * * * * *
                        *</p>
                    <p>As regards the proposal that the principal commercial powers shall have
                        advisory representation in the customs administration, it is claimed, and
                        think rightly, by my colleagues that it would be impossible to exclude any
                        of the powers from such representation and, further, such representation
                        would result in bringing about just what all of the powers have been seeking
                        to prevent, i. e., direct international interference in the financial
                        administration of the Empire.</p>
                    <p>As to your suggestion that some of the articles on the tariff of imports be
                        subjected to a duty as high as 15 per cent, this will also be strongly
                        objected to, especially by the Japanese, who will not, I have been
                        repeatedly told, agree to any raising of the Chinese tariff above 10 per
                        cent, which is practically all that Japan has been able to secure for
                        herself under her recently negotiated treaties.</p>
                    <p>All of my colleagues approve, in principle, of the suggestion made by you
                        “that the farming of China’s revenues should be restricted, if not wholly
                        discontinued, and a uniform and honest Imperial fiscal system substituted;”
                        but, while deeming it highly advantageous to China, as well as to foreign
                        interests in China, they are of opinion that it must be the gradual outcome
                        of general reform of the Empire, which we all hope for, but which few, if
                        any, of us will live to see carried through, if present indications are not
                        absolutely misleading.</p>

                        express the regrets of the Emperor of China for the assassination of the
                        former German minister here, provided for in article 1 of the Joint Note of
                        December 22 last, expects to sail from Shanghai for Germany on or about July
                        20, 1901. It is led by the brother of the Emperor, Prince Chün, and
                        consists, all told, of some 40 persons. I am informed that after the
                        completion of its official business, the mission is likely to return to
                        China via the United States and Japan, and a stay of a fortnight, or more,
                        is contemplated in the former country.</p>
                    <p>Article III of the Joint Note provides for reparation being made by the

                        of its legation here. A high Manchu official, Na Tung by name, a former
                        minister of the Tsungli Yamen, and a vice-president of the Board of revenue,
                        will go to Japan during the month of August to express to the Japanese

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my dispatch No. 55, dated March 24 last, I
                        informed yon that in view of certain opposition on the part of some of my
                        colleagues, and disinclination on the part of the Chinese plenipotentiaries
                        to take up at that time the question of the rehabilitation of Chang
                        Yin-huan, I would reserve to a more propitious moment the endeavor to carry
                        out your instructions in the matter.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday of last week, while calling on the viceroy, Li Hung-chang, I
                        referred to your instructions concerning Chang Yin-huan and expressed the
                        hope that the Imperial Government would perform the act of justice the
                        united States wished to see done. I stated to the Viceroy that if Prince
                        Ching and he would memorialize the Throne on the request of the United
                        States alone in the matter, I would be much pleased. * * *</p>
                    <p>The Viceroy stated that although he and Prince Ching personally would be
                        quite willing to urge the matter on the single representation of the United
                        States, he thought their memorial might be more promptly complied with if
                        Great Britain, whom he knew was also interested in the case of Chang
                        Yin-huan, addressed a request similar to the one I proposed making. Although
                        the Viceroy did not commit himself in expressing an opinion as to the
                        probable outcome of the representations which he agreed to make the Emperor
                        in the matter, I am led to believe that some action will be taken; probably,
                        however, no posthumous honors will be granted to Chang Yin-huan, but his
                        name will be cleared of the crimes which now tarnish it.</p>
                    <p>I inclose herewith copies of the notes sent by the British minister and
                        myself to the Chinese plenipotentiaries on this subject.</p>

                            Turkestan.</p>
                        <p>Chang Yin-huan was Chinese minister to the United States from 1885 to
                            1889 and during his stay in the United States won the respect and
                            affection of all with whom he came into contact, whether officially or
                            socially, and did much to strengthen and render more close the friendly
                            relations between our countries.</p>
                        <p>Although his death occurred eleven years after his departure from America
                            the news was received at Washington with sincere sorrow, and the

                            posthumous honors be conferred upon him. The Government and people of
                            the United States of America will see in the performance of this act by
                            China a further proof of the spirit of friendliness and justice which
                            has always marked the intercourse between the two countries.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Highness and Your Excellency</hi>: I feel that
                            it is my duty to bring to the notice of your highness and your
                            excellency the case of Chang Yin-huan, formerly minister in the tsung-li
                            yamen, who was decapitated last July while in exile in the New
                            Dominion.</p>
                        <p>Chang Yin-huan was well known to His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and
                            was held in esteem by my predecessors, Sir N. R. O’Connor and Sir C.
                            McDonald. He was sent as special ambassador to England on the occasion
                            of the diamond jubilee of the late Queen Victoria, and he received the
                            grand cross of a high order from Her Britannic Majesty’s Government.
                            Moreover, it was generally felt at the time of his exile that he was
                            more unfortunate than culpable, and it was fully expected that His
                            Imperial Majesty, the Emperor, would see fit in the course of time to
                            restore him to rank and favor. His execution in a time of disorder, and
                            after he had, in a measure, expiated his original fault, has been the
                            source, of sincere sorrow to all those in England who knew him.</p>
                        <p>I am sure that His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor, can only desire that
                            justice be done to the memory of an old and faithful servant, and I
                            would therefore request your highness and your excellency to memorialize
                            the Throne in order that Chang Yin-huan’s record may be cleared and his
                            honors restored. Such an act of grace will be thoroughly appreciated by
                            the people and Government of Great Britain.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The diplomatic corps held a meeting to-day to
                        consider (1) a new plan of amortization of the indemnity debts, (2) the
                        proposition submitted by me on the 8th of June last that further
                        negotiations concerning the settlement of the indemnities should be
                        transferred to The Hague tribunal, and (3) the transfer of the local
                        administration of Peking to the Chinese authorities, and other pending
                        questions.</p>
                    <p>The amortization scheme and the details given by the German minister
                        concerning it will shortly be printed, and I will transmit copies to you as
                        soon as received.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that the Chinese plenipotentiaries should be informed that
                        their troops could approach to within 20 li of Peking, but the date on which
                        said troops would be allowed to enter the city was not stated. It will, I
                        suppose, be only after the evacuation by the expeditionary forces. It was
                        also agreed to issue a proclamation in the name of the powers reciting the
                        events which have brought about the occupation by the foreign forces of the
                        province, and the conditions under which they now evacuate it.</p>
                    <p>The Russian minister stated that his Government accepted the two commercial
                        compensations asked for by me in consideration of our agreeing to the
                        raising of the tariff on imports to 5 per cent effective; it also accepted
                        as a mode of payment of the indemnity 4 per cent bonds at par, but on
                        condition that all the powers did likewise; if any power asked special
                        advantages for itself his Government would also ask for them. This latter,
                        of course, refers to the reservation made by the Japanese Government
                        concerning its inability to accept without a loss 4 per cent bonds at par.
                        The objections of the Japanese Government were communicated to you in my No.
                        123, of the 22d ultimo.</p>
                    <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0262"/>
                    <p>The question of the currency in which the indemnity is to be asked of China
                        was then taken up. Most of the representatives have formal instructions to
                        insist that the bonds given them shall be in the gold currency of their
                        respective countries. This, of course, will be impossible, as the indemnity
                        is to be asked without details or explanations. It seems to me that it
                        should be calculated in Haikwan taels at a rate to be determined.</p>
                    <p>The question of the payment of private claims was then considered. The German
                        representative was in favor of China contracting a special loan for this
                        purpose, so that they could be paid off immediately in cash, as his
                        Government had informed him that it could not undertake to negotiate the
                        bonds paid it on account of private claims. This scheme did not meet with
                        general favor. I stated that the United States would see to the payment of
                        the claims of its own citizens out of the amount paid it as an indemnity by
                        China. The French minister made a similar declaration.</p>
                    <p>I then stated to the diplomatic corps that nearly a month ago I suggested to
                        them the advisability of transferring future negotiations concerning the
                        indemnity to The Hague tribunal; that to enable them to get instructions
                        from their Governments regarding the matter I had not formally called the
                        matter up since the 8th of June, and I trusted they were now in a position
                        to give me their views on the subject, so 1 could communicate them to my
                        Government. I referred to the difficulties which still beset our way; the
                        fact that we had not as yet reached even a formal agreement as to the amount
                        of the indemnity to be asked of China; that the question of interest also
                        divided us, and that innumerable questions were cropping up daily, all of
                        which tended to demonstrate that the suggestion made by the United States
                        was probably the only one which could insure a settlement of this
                        complicated matter. I said that my Government was willing and desirous that
                        either the whole question should be submitted to The Hague tribunal, or, in
                        case that could not be agreed upon, such portions thereof as it seemed
                        impossible to settle here.</p>
                    <p>I was surprised to find that, with the exception of the British minister,
                        none of the representatives were in a position to speak on the subject. I
                        stated that the proposal of the United States was not a new one, that it had
                        been before the conference for five months, and that I anticipated that it
                        had received due consideration. I shall avail myself of any opportunity
                        which may hereafter present itself to bring the subject again before
                        them.</p>
                    <p>The British minister said that he had received instructions on the subject
                        from his Government, but as his colleagues had not heard from theirs, he
                        would communicate his to me privately. In substance the British Government
                        deems it either too late to submit many of the questions connected with the
                        indemnity to arbitration, or is assured that such reference will be opposed
                        by some of the other powers. It thinks, however, that the matter of the
                        distribution of the indemnity might properly be submitted to The Hague
                        conference.</p>
                    <p>The opposition of the British Government to the Russian proposal that the
                        tariff on imports should be raised in the event of payments on account of
                        the indemnity not being regularly made still blocks the way to Russia’s
                        acceptance of 450,000,000 taels as the lump sum to be asked of China, and
                        also to her agreeing to the revenues to be assigned <pb n="257"
                            xml:id="pg_257" facs="0263"/>for the purposes of payment on account of
                        interest. How long this difficulty may last I have no means of knowing. * *
                        *</p>
                    <p>Altogether, the present outlook for a prompt solution of the indemnity and
                        financial questions is not by any means as bright as it was when I
                        telegraphed you on the 15th of last month.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit herewith, for the
                        information of the Department, certain correspondence concerning the further
                        improvement of the water approaches to Tientsin. This matter was first
                        brought to the attention of the Department by Mr. Denby in his dispatch No.
                        2715, of March 19, 1897. The greater part of the works undertaken in 1898
                        were destroyed during the troubles of last year, but the benefits derived
                        from them by Tientsin, and the possibility of improving the approaches to
                        that city so that steamships might come up to it, as they did prior to 1886,
                        have encouraged the foreign community to hope that by promptly and
                        energetically prosecuting the works already begun the desired results might
                        be readily obtained. Inelosures 1, 4, and 15 give a concise history of what
                        has been done in the past and what it is now proposed to do.</p>
                    <p>In 1898 it was agreed by the foreign community to contribute, as its
                        proportion of the fund necessary for the conservancy works, a municipal or
                        river tax of 1 per cent on all duties payable on merchandise landed, and a
                        loan of 150,000 taels at 6 per cent was contracted on that security. The
                        chamber of commerce of Tientsin, in its communication of March 2 to the
                        consular corps (inclosure No. 3), now suggests that this river due be
                        doubled, and that the period of collection be extended to the year 1925. It
                        is estimated that this tax will yield about 42,000 taels per annum, which
                        sum will be sufficient for the payment of the interest and amortization on
                        the 1898 loan which is to be extinguished in 1909, and of which 130,000
                        taels remain outstanding; also for the new 7 per cent loan of 300,000 taels
                        which it is proposed to contract.</p>
                    <p>The total cost of the works to be executed is roughly estimated at 500,000
                        taels. The Provisional Government of Tientsin will temporarily contribute a
                        monthly subsidy of 5,000 taels for current expenses until the loan can be
                        made, and are willing to assume one-half the expenses of the work to be
                        undertaken. The new committee for the preservation and navigation of the
                        Peiho was, after some discussion between the diplomatic and consular corps
                        on one side and the foreign military authorities on the other, finally
                        organized, and on June 11 commenced the discharge of its duties. (Inclosure
                        No. 11.)</p>
                    <p>The proposal of the chamber of commerce, that the river due should be
                        increased to 2 per cent, was submitted by the senior consul at Tientsin to
                        the diplomatic corps in his letter of June 20 (inclosure No. 13) and was
                        duly approved by the latter on the 3d instant.</p>
                    <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0264"/>
                    <p>Although without definite instructions on the subject, I did not hesitate to
                        agree to this slight increase, in view of the Department’s previous
                        instructions to Mr. Denby when he approved the tax of 1 per cent for the
                        same purpose. The Secretary of State then wrote Mr. Denby, in reply to the
                        latter’s No. 2911, of April 13, 1898, approving his action, “the proposed
                        tax appearing to be proper in principle and not enormous in amount.” (Mr.
                        Day to Mr. Denby, No. 1591, of May 27, 1898.)</p>
                    <p>The continuance of the financial aid of the Chinese Government after the
                        dissolution of the Provisional Government at Tientsin will be insured by the
                        provision to be inserted in the agreement to be made with it regarding the
                        financial measures to be taken for the payment of the indemnity, wherein it
                        will be stated that in consideration of the raising of the tariff to 5 per
                        cent, effective on imports, China will participate financially in the
                        improvement of the Peiho and Whangpu rivers.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: By desire of the committee of this
                            chamber, I have the honor to address you on the subject of the further
                            improvement of the water approaches to these settlements and the native
                            city.</p>
                        <p>It seems to be generally admitted that the works already carried out by
                            Mr. De Linde have proved of very material advantage, and have in a large
                            measure restored the water communication between the settlement and
                            Taku. Lighters and small steamers have been able to navigate the river
                            and reach Tientsin during the past year on a much heavier draft and with
                            less difficulty and risk of collision than has been the case for several
                            years past. This in itself has proved of immense benefit to the general
                            trade of the port and has fully justified the comparatively small
                            expenditure which has been made up to the present time.</p>
                        <p>Having regard to the decreased rainfall during the last two seasons and
                            taking in consideration the vast accumulation of silt, it naturally
                            follows that some time must elapse before the river is restored to a
                            condition to enable steamers to safely navigate the channel, as was the
                            case previous to the years 1885, 1886. But there seems little doubt in
                            the minds of those qualified to express an opinion that the results
                            obtained must be regarded as satisfactory and encourage the hope that
                            further work will ultimately achieve the desired success. Mr. De Linde’s
                            original plans for dealing with the river embraced the cutting of
                            several bends to not only shorten the river, but also to obtain the
                            fullest advantage from the incoming tide and the natural increase of
                            force of the outgoing current, which it is calculated would remove the
                            silt accumulation within a very much shorter period than could possibly
                            occur under other circumstances. My committee, in consultation with
                            gentlemen representing the shipping interests of the port, have
                            carefully considered the question, and I am directed to inform you that
                            we are unanimously of opinion that some steps should be taken at once to
                            adopt the recommendations contained in Mr. De Linde’s reports of 1890
                            and 1901 (copies of which I understand are in your possession), and to
                            proceed at once with the work of cutting the Tientsin and arsenal bends
                            together, with certain other measures embodied in these reports.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that the country between Tientsin and Taku is now
                            under the jurisdiction of the provisional government, the committee
                            think the time most opportune for dealing with the matter, as the many
                            difficulties incidental to such an enterprise can be more effectually
                            dealt with. It is estimated that to cut the two bends named, modify the
                            radius of other bends, and obtain certain reaches, will require the
                            expenditure of some 300,000 taels. As my committee anticipate that
                            difficulties may arise in connection with raising such funds, this
                            aspect of the question has been discussed very fully, and I may say, for
                            your information, that the chamber, subject to the appointment of a duly
                            constituted conservancy board representing the various <pb n="259"
                                xml:id="pg_259" facs="0265"/>interests involved to insure a
                            continuity of policy, will be prepared to formulate a scheme for the
                            approval of the diplomatic body in Pekin.</p>
                        <p>In asking you to place this matter before your colleagues, I venture to
                            hope we may receive your invaluable support and assistance, and that the
                            question may be considered with as little delay as possible.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your letter dated February 25, in which you are good enough
                            to inform me that the consular body, having considered my letter of
                            February 13 on the subject of river improvement, are willing to do all
                            in their power to further the measures proposed by the chamber and
                            requesting me to submit for their consideration our views on the
                            subject. In accordance with that request I have now the pleasure to
                            bring before you for the consideration of the consular body the opinion
                            of this chamber on the question of administration and our suggestions
                            for raising the required funds.</p>
                        <p>Administration: For the proper control of the works and finances to
                            insure a continuity of policy until all loans and obligations ate fully
                            discharged, it is absolutely necessary that a conservancy board be
                            constituted, and it seems most desirable that such a board should
                            represent all the interests involved.</p>
                        <p>My committee think a board constituted as follows would meet these
                            requirements and not prove too cumbersome to be effective: Doyen, or
                            nominee of the consular body; a member of the provisional government;
                            the commissioner of Imperial maritime customs; a representative of the
                            shipping interests; a representative from each properly constituted
                            foreign municipality.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested this board be especially empowered to— <list>
                                <label>A.</label>
                                <item>Assume full control of the river works already created.</item>
                                <label>B.</label>
                                <item>Accept all the obligations pertaining to the scheme of 1898
                                    now in existence.</item>
                                <label>C.</label>
                                <item>Assume all financial control.</item>
                                <label>D.</label>
                                <item>To appoint an expert consulting engineer.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Finance: The 6 per cent municipal loan issued in 1898, to provide the
                            foreign contribution for the scheme of that year, was for 150,000 taels,
                            and of this amount 130,000 taels remains outstanding at the present
                            time.</p>
                        <p>As security for the payment of interest amortization the sanction of the
                            ministers and Chinese authorities was obtained to levy dues of 1 per
                            cent on duties paid in the ordinary way to the Imperial customs. There
                            were a few slight modifications made in the river-dues tariff to meet
                            especial cases, and the period of collection was from August 1, 1898,
                            until 1910 (twelve years), by which time it was calculated the whole
                            obligation would be liquidated.</p>
                        <p>For the first complete year the amount so collected was, after deducting
                            the cost of collection, about 21,000 taels, or slightly below what had
                            been estimated, but still fully sufficient to meet the financial
                            requirements. It is estimated that to provide funds for the new works in
                            contemplation a further sum of 300,000 taels will be required, and my
                            committee proposes that this sum be raised by the issue of bonds under
                            the seal or seals of the municipalities, as was the case before. Owing,
                            however, to different financial conditions prevailing now, a rate of 7
                            per cent interest instead of 6 per cent must be provided for. As a first
                            security for the payment of <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0266"
                            />interest and amortization of this proposed loan, it is absolutely
                            necessary that calculation should be based upon a revenue likely to
                            arise from shipping or otherwise, when steamers are able to reach the
                            bund, and it is therefore proposed that the existing river dues of 1 per
                            cent should be doubled (making the levy 2 per cent on duties) and that
                            the period of collection be extended until 1923, or twenty-five years
                            from the original date.</p>
                        <p>Based upon the figures previously referred to, this would produce an
                            annual sum of 42,000 taels, which would be sufficient to terminate the
                            existing loan of 130,000 taels, and the new 7 per cent loan of 300,000
                            taels in 1909 and 1919.</p>
                        <p>My committee wish to urge upon you the principle that all craft deriving
                            benefit from the improved condition of the river should be called upon
                            to contribute in some form to the general funds, and the chamber
                            therefore earnestly submits for yous consideration the following
                            proposals, viz: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>That all lighters coming to the bunds and wharves, or
                                    discharging in the Tientsin reach, shall contribute 5 candareens
                                    per ton (dead weight) on the cargo brought up in their own
                                    bottoms. Provided always, that such charge shall not be made if
                                    the depth of water in any part of the river between Taku and
                                    Tientsin be less than 9 feet.</item>

                                <item>That all steamers coming to the bunds and wharves, or
                                    discharging in the Tientsin reach, shall likewise contribute 5
                                    candareens per ton (dead weight) on cargo brought up in their

                            the final success of the scheme that they are of the opinion that even
                            at the extremely moderate rates named the whole liability in connection

                            as long as the financial obligations named above exist, I have reason to
                            believe the steamship companies will offer no objections to the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monsieur the Dean</hi>: Since the silting up of the
                            river has prevented steamers from coming up to Tientsin, the consular
                            corps, the chamber of commerce, and the municipalities duly preoccupied
                            by this condition, so prejudicial to the general interests of this port,
                            have endeavored to make the course of the Peiho available again for
                            steam navigation.</p>
                        <p>In 1897, after a series of long and difficult negotiations with the
                            Chinese authorities, an understanding was happily reached on a plan
                            drawn up by Mr. de Linde, a Danish engineer, which entailed a general
                            outlay of 315,000 taels, of which amount it was decided to devote in the
                            first place 250,000 taels to carrying out the most urgent works needed
                            for raising the level of the river. The viceroy of Pechili consented to
                            contribute the sum of 100,000 taels, and the foreign community was to
                            raise itself the balance of 150,000 taels to insure the payment of
                            interest and the amortization of the loan decided upon.</p>
                        <p>In the first place, the foreign commerce expressed itself in favor of a
                            method of taxation to be settled upon to which foreign enterprise and
                            native traffic were alike to be subject. This plan was, however, shortly
                            after abandoned, and so as to prevent any loss of time a plan was
                            adopted which was more readily applicable and was based on the creation
                            of a municipal tax, due on entry and leaving, on all merchandise subject
                            to the payment of customs dues. The levying of this was to be done in
                            the name and for the account of the municipalities, through the customs
                            administration, <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0267"/>for a period of
                            twelve years from the 1st of August, 1898, to the 1st of August, 1910.
                            Such was the condition of the question, of which I have only outlined
                            the general features, when it was submitted to you with all details in a
                            letter dated the 5th of August, 1898, by Mr. Tei,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d155fn1">Inclosed in Mr. Denby’s No. 2911 of April 13, 1898,
                                to the Secretary of State. (W. R.)</note> at the time dean of the
                            consular body, with a request that you submit it to the diplomatic
                            corps, and obtain from it the necessary agreement for the establishment
                            of the tax referred to. With a promptitude for which the foreign
                            community of Tientsin has always shown itself deeply grateful, the
                            proposition was presented by you to your colleagues, and a few days
                            after you returned it to Mr. Tei with their unanimous assent. A loan of
                            150,000 taels was shortly after contracted at the Hongkong and Shanghai
                            Banking Corporation by the British municipality;, and on the 26th of
                            July a contract with Mr. de Linde for a period of two years was signed
                            by him, the dean of the consular corps, the taotai, and the commissioner
                            of customs, and the works, the control and supervision of which were
                            intrusted to the dean and to the taotai, commenced on the 1st of
                            August.</p>
                        <p>The works were continued without interruption until the 25th of May, and
                            have been carried out in the most satisfactory way. All the dams were
                            finished when hostilities broke out, and a very decided improvement had
                            already taken place in the river, the level of which had risen and had
                            been maintained at an average of 10 feet of depth, allowing boats, if
                            they had not been impeded by the sharp bends of the river, to come up to
                            Tientsin. Serious damages, happily repaired since, thanks to the
                            financial aid given by the British military authorities, have restored
                            things to the position in which they were before the insurrection, and
                            the satisfactory results which I previously indicated may be considered
                            as definitely secured.</p>
                        <p>Calm being reestablished, the chamber of commerce of Tientsin, anxious to
                            carry out in full the programme of 1897 and to see completed the de
                            Linde plan, has again requested the aid of the consular body, and has
                            transmitted to me, under date of the 2d of this month, a very full
                            memorandum, which forms the inclosure No. 1 and which contains the
                            following propositions, which, briefly stated, are: <list>

                        </p>

                            corps, and I have been directed to transmit them to your excellency with
                            the request that you secure the approval of the diplomatic corps to
                            them, said approval being awaited so that the loan in question may be
                            issued without any delay.</p>
                        <p>One of my colleagues, the German consul, has expressed the wish adopted
                            by all, to see eventually the tax of 2 per cent transformed into a fixed
                            tonnage due, to be levied on all ships coming within the waters of
                            Tientsin. But this measure, requiring the sanction of all Governments,
                            could only be carried out after more or less delay, and it seems for the
                            time being preferable so as to escape all delay, of following a method
                            similar to that adopted in 1898 and to provide for actual requirements
                            by a municipal tax.</p>
                        <p>I must finally inform your excellency and beg you to call the attention
                            of all of your colleagues to the semiconflict which has arisen between
                            the consular corps and the provisional government, which, though it
                            existed previously in a latent state, has only broken out through
                            improvement of the river. The incident which took place on this
                            connection has raised a question of principle which can only be settled
                            by the diplomatic corps, and I am instructed by my colleagues to
                            request, through your medium, a decision determining definitely the rôle
                            and the attributions of each of the parties. The letter by which the
                            provisional government notified me under date of the 22d of August of
                            its assumption of power, which dated from the 25th of <pb n="262"
                                xml:id="pg_262" facs="0268"/>July, contains a declaration, the
                            importance of which can not escape you. “The council,” it is there said,
                            “being the emanation of all the powers, shall enjoy, within the
                            territory which is confided to it, absolute independence, and shall
                            comply, so far as possible, with all the demands which may be made of
                            it, as well by the commanders of the allied troops as by the consuls of
                            the foreign powers.”</p>
                        <p>We all experienced a certain amount of surprise in learning that the
                            provisional government which we thought was only a delegation of the
                            generals commanding the allied troops and specially charged with the
                            administration and police of the city and its surroundings having no
                            political character and no authority over foreigners, considered itself
                            on the contrary as the emanation of the powers who had already permanent
                            and authorized representatives in the persons of their ministers; that
                            it reserved to itself the right to pass on the requests which would be
                            made to it by the foreign consuls. Perhaps we should have protested at
                            the time, but no difficulty having arisen for several months, we kept
                            silence, trusting that nothing would arise obliging us to break it. But
                            on the 12th of February, the provisional government, which could not
                            ignore the fact that the consular corps had been the only one until then
                            intrusted with the question of the improvement of the river, and had
                            superintended the works, took the initiative of calling a meeting to
                            which it invited the consuls and the presidents of the chamber of
                            commerce and of the British municipality.</p>
                        <p>I informed my colleagues of the invitation which had been sent them, and
                            we discussed together the answer to be made. It was unanimously decided
                            to abstain, and I was directed by my colleagues to send a letter to the
                            members of the provisional government, the terms of which were settled
                            upon in a meeting, informing them of our decision.</p>
                        <p>I should add that the same action was taken by the presidents of the
                            chamber of commerce and the British municipality.</p>
                        <p>In its turn, after having adopted in principle the conclusions reached by
                            the chamber of commerce as regards the proposition of the committee of
                            control of supervision, the consular corps requested me to ask the
                            provisional government to designate one of its members to be present at
                            a meeting of said committee, at which were to be examined the proposals
                            of the chamber of commerce. Deeming doubtless either that its dignity
                            did not allow it to respond to the requests of the consuls, or that it
                            could do without their assistance, the provisional government informed
                            me by letter that it did not consider that it could agree to send a
                            delegate. It ended this communication by stating that it had given
                            orders for beginning the works in the shortest period possible, and that
                            it would be happy to see a member of the consular corps on the
                            commission it had organized for that purpose.</p>
                        <p>This statement will enable your excellency to understand the situation
                            and to realize that it can not continue without serious inconveniences.
                            If the provisional government is qualified to look after the commercial
                            interests of the various nations confided until the present time to the
                            consuls under, direction of their various ministers; if it has the power
                            to have approved by the diplomatic corps the impost of taxes destined to
                            insure the payments on a loan contracted for works of general
                            usefulness, the consular corps is ready to bow to the decision of its
                            chiefs, but if as it hopes, the latter’s rights are maintained, it
                            thinks that two committees are useless, and that the provisional
                            government, whose suggestions will always be listened to, and which will
                            furthermore have, just as the consular corps, a vote in the committee,
                            should be notified to join it and to deposit in the common fund the sums
                            which it proposes to expend on the Peiho works.</p>
                        <p>It is with the most absolute confidence that in the name of my colleagues
                            and my own, I place this case in your hands, certain that it can not
                            find a defender more just and devoted.</p>
                        <p>Please accept, Mr. Dean, the assurances of my consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monsieur le Marechal</hi>: The diplomatic corps has
                            examined most carefully and with great interest the communication which
                            your excellency was pleased to make it in your letter of the 13th March,
                            and which bears on the question of the measures to be taken to improve
                            the navigation of the Peiho.</p>
                        <p>It saw that these measures had at the same time a military, commercial,
                            and political character, and that as such they interested equally the
                            military, consular, and <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0269"
                            />diplomatic authorities. It appeared, furthermore, that for several
                            years past, as your excellency remarked, it has been called upon to
                            occupy itself with this question, in conjunction with the
                            governor-general of Chihli. After negotiations which took place at Pekin
                            between the representatives of the powers and the Chinese Government, a
                            committee composed of the dean of the consular corps at Tientsin, of the
                            commissioner of the maritime customs and of the customs taotai, was
                            intrusted with the supervision of the works which were to be carried out
                            by the engineer chosen by the consular corps, and with the financial
                            measures to be taken to insure said execution.</p>
                        <p>The diplomatic corps is of the opinion that to guarantee the continuation
                            of the work of which it took the initiative, and to maintain its
                            original character, it is necessary not to modify, any more than
                            circumstances demand, the composition of the committee which it formed
                            jointly with the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>Among the component parts of the committee there are two which subsist in
                            the state in which they were at the time when this business was begun.
                            These are the dean of the consular corps and the commissioner of customs
                            at Tientsin. The customs taotai has disappeared with the local
                            authorities, which have been replaced by the provisional government, who
                            assumed its powers. It is consequently for the provisional government,
                            invested with purely administrative powers, to delegate a representative
                            so that the committee, incomplete as a result of events, shall be
                            reconstructed and in a position to continue its labors.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of the powers are entirely in accord with your
                            excellency and with the provisional government on the utility which
                            necessitates the improvement of the navigation of the Peiho. It is
                            particularly for that reason that they deem it proper to preserve the
                            method which they have adopted, and to leave to the consular authority
                            all the rôle which belongs to it in the accomplishment of this
                            undertaking. If it were otherwise, the day when the local authorities
                            shall resume the normal exercise of their functions shall substitute
                            themselves in their turn to the provisional government, the consular
                            corps would find that it had lost the benefit of its regular position,
                            which would compromise its influence and might endanger all the
                            interests which it has for its mission to represent.</p>
                        <p>The diplomatic corps is expecting a report of the consular corps on this
                            subject. As soon as it shall have received and examined it, it will at
                            once give the necessary instructions to the consuls so that the
                            undertaking in which the provisional government so rightly interests
                            itself may continue in the most favorable conditions, and to the
                            satisfaction of all interests. I shall not fail to communicate these
                            instructions to your excellency.</p>
                        <p>Please accept, Monsieur le Marechal, the assurances of my highest
                            considerations.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your excellency’s letter of the 20th of March, concerning the
                            steps to be taken for improving the navigation of the Peiho.</p>
                        <p>I can not but express my profound gratitude for the cordial reception
                            given by your excellency to the views which I detailed in my letter of
                            the 13th of March.</p>
                        <p>I have also to express my great satisfaction that my argument on the
                            great value which, from a political, military, and commercial point of
                            view, should be attached to the most prompt carrying out of the
                            conservancy works in question, has met, in principle, with the approval
                            of your excellency and your colleagues.</p>
                        <p>In my above letter of the 15th of March I inclosed the minutes of the
                            provisional government of Tientsin relating to this business, and
                            requested that they be returned to me when no longer needed. Not having
                            received these minutes with the letter of your excellency of the 20th
                            March, I beg that you will return them to me.</p>
                        <p>As to the question itself, fully appreciating the arguments adduced by
                            your excellency, I deem it advisable that the conservancy works of the
                            Peiho should be intrusted to the direction and subject to the control of
                            a committee. By this means misunderstandings and conflicts as to
                            competency will be most easily averted—conflicts which it would seem
                            have already taken place at Tientsin, and through which the interests of
                            all and the early execution of the works might be materially
                            compromised.</p>
                        <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0270"/>
                        <p>For my part, I can have no objection to the composition of this committee
                            as suggested by you excellency, to wit: A member of the provisional
                            government, a member of the consular corps, and a representative of the
                            maritime customs.</p>
                        <p>Likewise I can see no objection to representatives of the concessions at
                            Tientsin being admitted to the meetings of the committee for
                            consultation only. This committee would have to examine the question of
                            the improvement of the Peiho from technical and financial points of
                            view, and adopt on its own responsibility the necessary measures to
                            reach a satisfactory result on all different points.</p>
                        <p>Since I am not in a position to give orders myself to the provisional
                            government, being obliged previously to obtain the consent of the
                            commanders of the various contingents, I shall not fail to ask their
                            opinion immediately; but, I think I may count on their consent;
                            consequently, to prevent all loss of time, I have taken the liberty of
                            previously submitting in my own name to the consideration of the
                            diplomatic corps the above-enumerated propositions.</p>
                        <p>As I am led to believe by some remarks contained in your letter of the
                            20th of March that there is some uncertainty as to the duty and the
                            powers of the provisional government, I inclose a copy of the
                            regulations drawn up by the commanders of the various contingents for
                            the provisional government.</p>

                            for the improvement of navigation on the Peiho; it has decided to give

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monsieur le Doyen</hi>: I have received and
                            communicated to my colleagues the letter which you wrote me on the 18th
                            of this month, in the name of the consular corps of Tientsin, concerning
                            the plan for improving the navigability of the Peiho.</p>
                        <p>Prior to this the question had been submitted to the diplomatic corps by
                            his excellency Marshal Waldersee, in the name of the provisional
                            government of Tientsin, and it had been called upon to express its
                            opinion on the principal points submitted by you for the consideration
                            of the representatives of the powers.</p>
                        <p>Inclosed you will find copy of the letter which my colleagues unanimously
                            directed me to send to his excellency Marshal Waldersee, in reply to the
                            one I had received from him.</p>
                        <p>In a second letter, of which I send you all the passages concerning the
                            means which might be used to improve the navigability of the Peiho, his
                            excellency Marshal Waldersee accepts for himself, and, subject to
                            consultation with the commanders of the expeditionary corps, the
                            constitution of a committee in which shall be represented the consular
                            corps of Tientsin, the maritime customs, the provisional government, and
                            the foreign commerce.</p>
                        <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0271"/>
                        <p>Such being the case, it seems to the diplomatic corps that it only
                            remains to leave to the consuls to reach an understanding with the
                            provisional government, to organize a committee to determine the powers
                            to be granted its members and to carry on the execution of the plan, the
                            history of which was very exactly outlined by you in the letter to which
                            I had the honor to reply.</p>
                        <p>As to the question of principle resulting from the constitution of the
                            provisional government and from the functions which it has attributed to
                            itself, its importance can not escape the representatives of the powers,
                            and I am directed by them to inform you that they have the question
                            under consideration and will soon be in a position to inform you of
                            their solution of it.</p>

                            of the 25th of last March and at the same time as a reply to the
                            communication of your excellency of the 26th instant, the commander in
                            chief of the allied armies has the honor to inform your excellency that
                            the commanders of the contingents represented in the provisional
                            government of Tientsin have now agreed with the proposal to continue the
                            works for the improvement of the Peiho through a committee composed as
                            stated in the dispatch of the 25th of last month.</p>
                        <p>The time has therefore come for the consular body at Tientsin to appoint
                            the member of the committee which belongs to it to designate, and the
                            commander in chief of the allied forces requests you to take the
                            necessary steps to this end with the consular body. In the interests of
                            the undertaking all action taken in the matter will be greatly
                            appreciated. Sir Alfred Gaselee particularly called the attention of the
                            commander in chief of the allied forces to this subject.</p>
                        <p>As to the question who shall preside over the committee, the commander of
                            the allied forces takes the liberty of proposing that the presidency
                            shall be given to the member senior in rank who represents foreign
                            interests. The member of the committee to be appointed by the
                            provisional government of Tientsin could also for this purpose be
                            considered as a representative of foreign interests.</p>
                        <p>By order of the commander in chief of the allied forces:</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to address
                            your excellency on the subject of the proposed conservancy board for the
                            regulation of the Peiho River, the formation of which your excellency
                            was good enough to state in your letter of the 26th of March had been
                            approved by the diplomatic body in Peking.</p>
                        <p>After the departure of M. du Chaylard, the late doyen of the consular
                            body at Tientsin, it fell to my lot, as his successor as senior consul,
                            to invite my colleagues to a meeting to decide on the next steps to be
                            taken for the definitive selection of the personnel of the new
                            board.</p>
                        <p>This meeting was held on the 29th of April, and during the course of our
                            discussion it appeared that minutes of the meeting of the 13th of March
                            had been drawn up and signed by the late doyen and sent to one of our
                            number, but the rest not having seen the document and no draft having
                            been left in the doyen’s archives, it was resolved to adjourn till next
                            day, the 30th, to enable these minutes to be circulated.</p>
                        <p>We accordingly met again yesterday, and it is as a result of this second
                            meeting that I am now addressing your excellency.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency will observe that part of M. du Chaylard’s letter to your
                            excellency of the 18th of March, which deals with the proposed
                            composition of the conservancy board, is not altogether expressed in the
                            same terms as are used in the minutes, a copy of which I have the honor
                            to inclose herewith.</p>
                        <p>It was probably a consequence of the press of work, due to his
                            approaching departure, that M. du Chaylard did not observe the
                            appreciable variation between the two proposals on this head, as stated
                            in his letter and in the minutes.</p>
                        <p>However, a certain degree of importance attaches to the point, and the
                            three members of our body who were present at the meeting of the 13th of
                            March, as well as at <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0272"/>those of
                            the 29th and 30th of April, namely, the consuls for Belgium, Germany,
                            and Russia, are of the opinion that the minutes represent more exactly
                            what was agreed to at the earlier meeting than those of Monsieur du
                            Chaylard’s letter of March 18. Under these circumstances we have felt it
                            best to bring these minutes to your excellency’s notice, in order that
                            the diplomatic body may be apprised of the facts above stated, and have
                            opportunity, should they see fit, to signify their view as to which
                            scheme for the composition of the conservancy board should be
                            adopted—that specified in M. du Chaylard’s letter or that contained in
                            the latter part of resolution 2 of the minutes forwarded herewith.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor, etc.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to inform
                            your excellency that a plenary meeting of the Peiho River conservancy
                            board was held yesterday afternoon, which, I trust that I am not
                            oversanguine in thinking, should have important and satisfactory
                            results.</p>
                        <p>Among the various questions that were then discussed was that of
                            financial ways and means.</p>
                        <p>General de Wogack, the president of the board, having announced certain
                            offers of financial assistance on the part of the Tientsin provisional
                            government to the meeting on condition that the commercial interests
                            concerned would raise funds on their side also, it was pointed out by
                            the chairman of the chamber of commerce that the commercial interests
                            were still willing to stand by their scheme of raising the necessary
                            funds which was proposed in their letter of March 2, 1901, to my
                            predecessor, M. du Chaylard, a copy of which was transmitted to your
                            excellency by him in his letter of the 18th of the same month. That
                            scheme was outlined in the following passage:</p>
                        <p>“As a first security for the payment of interest and amortization of this
                            proposed loan, it is absolutely necessary that calculations should be
                            based upon a revenue quite apart from any revenue likely to arise from
                            shipping, or otherwise, when steamers are able to reach the Bund, and it
                            is therefore proposed that the existing river dues (of 1 per cent) be
                            doubled (making the levy 2 per cent on duties), and that the period of
                            collection be extended until 1923, or twenty-five years from the
                            original date.”</p>
                        <p>The president of the chamber of commerce, however, now observed that no
                            statement had yet reached the chamber that its proposals in this regard
                            had received the approval and sanction of the diplomatic body in
                            Peking.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, with the assent of my colleagues present at the meeting, I
                            offered to address your excellency on the subject, and to express the
                            general hope that the explicit approval of their excellencies, the
                            members of the diplomatic body, of this proposition to double the
                            existing river dues may be signified to me for communication to the
                            chamber of commerce, thus enabling the necessary steps toward raising
                            the requisite funds to be taken without futher delay.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, etc.,</p>

                        <p>The question of rectifying the course of the Haiho (commonly called
                            Peiho, from one of the several streams that converge at Tientsin to
                            constitute that waterway) and of the work to be done to allow ships of a
                            certain draft of water (12 feet to 12 feet 6 inches at the utmost) to
                            ascend the river to the foreign concessions of Tientsin, is a very old
                            one.</p>
                        <p>After the disastrous flood of the spring of 1890 His Excellency Li Hung
                            Chang, then governor-general of Chihli, was induced to allow Mr. A. de
                            Linde, Danish engineer, <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0274"/>to make
                            surveys, on which a great scheme was proposed the same year by Mr. G.
                            Detring, at the time and again at present, commissioner at Tientsin of
                            the Chinese Imperial maritime customs. On the technical side this scheme
                            had the advantage of beginning the work before the state of the river,
                            as regards navigation, should get worse, as it has since done. As
                            financial means Mr. G. Detring proposed to employ: for the work the sum
                            of 1,000,000 taels, subscribed in the south (Canton) for the benefit of
                            the sufferers by the flood, and to repay this amount by annual
                            installments by levying extra tonnage dues on every ship making use of
                            the new channels. This would not have practically diverted the money
                            from its intended object, as the work projected would have regulated the
                            flow of the water so as to avoid future floods. A strong opposition on
                            the part of the local Chinese officials, who feared that the free
                            navigation of the river might interfere with their private interests,
                            succeeded in defeating the scheme.</p>
                        <p>The state of the river grew worse and worse, so that in 1896, during
                            several months, even lighters and tugboats could not come up to the
                            concessions.</p>
                        <p>This aroused at last the commercial community and led, in the beginning
                            of 1897, to the first negotiations between Count du Chaylard, French and
                            senior consul; Mr. H. B. Bristow, Her Britannic Majesty’s consul, with
                            Mr. Ed. Cousins, chairman of the Tientsin general Chamber of Commerce,
                            and Mr. de Linde, as adviser, on one side, and His Excellency Wang
                            Wen-Shao, at the time governor-general of Chihli, on the other
                            side—negotiations which concluded with the decision to undertake the
                            first part of the work, amounting to 250,000 taels, and the appointment
                            of a mixed Commission to carry it on. This commission was composed of— <list>
                                <item>The Tientsin customs (Haikwan) Taotai.</item>
                                <item>Two Chinese officials nominated by the governor-general as the

                                    Company.</item>
                                <item>The commissioner at Tientsin of the Chinese Imperial maritime
                                    customs.</item>
                                <item>Representatives of different shipping and lighters
                                    companies.</item>
                                <item>Representatives of the foreign concessions (in existence at

                                <item>Representatives of Tientsin general Chamber of

                            </list></p>
                        <p>The necessary amount of money was provided for by grants from the
                            municipal councils of the foreign concessions and from the Taku Tug and
                            Lighter Company, Limited, and an extra tonnage due of 3 candareens per
                            registered ton, levied for each trip; this last income, the most
                            important one (as the tonnage of the port being estimated at over
                            550,000 tons annually, it would represent more than three times the
                            total amount of all the others) could not be levied until the work was
                            finished and as certain powers formally objected to any increase in the
                            tonnage dues, it became necessary to find some other income approved by
                            everybody that could be raised at once. Finally it was agreed, with the
                            approbation of the Chinese authorities and the foreign ministers at
                            Peking, to levy an extra duty of one-half per mille “ad valorem” on all
                            merchandise, to be collected by the Chinese Imperial maritime customs on
                            account of the commission, to provide for the payment of interest and
                            amortization of a loan of 150,000 taels—guaranteed by the municipality
                            of the British concession, the governor-general giving the 100,000 taels
                            necessary to complete the 250,000 taels—needed to have the work done.
                            This being secured the work begun in the fall of 1898, and having been
                            actively pushed since spring 1899, was nearly finished in spring 1900,
                            thanks to the liberality of the ratepayers of the British concession,
                            who consented that certain of their municipal properties should be
                            mortgaged to guarantee the loan which otherwise could not have been
                            raised.</p>
                        <p>Last year’s events, still fresh to our memory, brought the destruction of
                            nearly all the works, and the indemnity claimed therefor from the
                            Chinese authorities amounts to 126,000 taels.</p>
                        <p>Immediately after the taking of the Tientsin native city, the British
                            military authorities tried to secure communication by the river, and
                            amongst others concluded an agreement with Mr. de Linde for several
                            months by which, for payment of certain sums, he undertook to have done
                            the most necessary work to maintain the depth of the water in the river
                            and water communication.</p>
                        <p>As the règlements généraux d’administration de la cité chinoise de
                            Tientsin established at the end of July through the unanimity of all the
                            commanding officers of the contingents of the allied powers did not
                            mention this matter, the council of the provisional government could not
                            attend to it, especially on account of having its jurisdiction limited
                            to the mud wall and want of funds.</p>
                        <p>It was only at the end of January of this year that his excellency, Field
                            Marshal Count von Waldersee, forwarded to the council of the provisional
                            government the new Règlements généraux du Gouvernement Provisoire du
                            district de Tientsin, approved by all the commanders in chief of the

                            necessary, maintain and improve the communications by the rivers and
                            canals. * * * *”</p>
                        <p>The council, which always kept an eye on this question, ordered, in
                            obedience to the new règlements généraux, Mr. de Linde, in charge of the
                            public works department, to report on this subject, and called
                            immediately for the 16th of February an unofficial meeting of all the
                            parties (bodies, corporations, associations, and others) interested in
                            the matter, so as to be able to discuss together the question and decide
                            what should be done, as the said council desired particularly to give to
                            the commercial community of Tientsin the benefit of the work which was
                            to be done in any case to secure, from a military point of view,
                            communication by water; the revenue having largely increased lately, the
                            council had sufficient means to start the work at once, intending to get
                            the balance from the indemnity to be paid by the Chinese authorities
                            who, in accepting the collective note from the ministers in Pekin, have
                            bound themselves to secure free communication between the capital and
                            the sea.</p>
                        <p>It is to be regretted that the council having not clearly exposed the
                            situation in the invitation to attend this meeting, some unfortunate
                            misunderstanding, embittered by questions of precedency, arose and
                            divided the council of the provisional government and the commissioner
                            of customs on one side from the consular body, municipal councils,
                            corporations, private companies, and the public in general on the other
                            side.</p>
                        <p>Therefore the council elected three of its members, Major-General de
                            Wogack, Lieutenant-Colonel Arlabosse, and Lieutenant-Colonel Bower, to
                            constitute a commission to take the necessary steps and to supervise the
                            work. Mr. Detring, commissioner of customs, the only one of those
                            invited who attended the meeting of February 16, was requested to join
                            the commission.</p>
                        <p>The revenue of the provisional government having exceeded the highest
                            expectations, the council decided, especially on account of the urgency
                            of having the work done before the rainy season, to put at the disposal
                            of the commission the amount of 100,000 taels, so as to enable it to
                            make a start at once.</p>
                        <p>At the meeting of the commission held on March 10–23, which Mr. Detring,
                            commissioner of customs, attended on being invited to do so, it was
                            decided, after having adopted some regulations, to begin at once the
                            work of the first cutting (the nearest to Tientsin), at a cost of about
                            100,000 taels, so that it could be finished before the rainy season
                            (middle June), and to request Mr. de Linde to report at once on the
                            immediate removal of part of the Taku North Fort, near the mouth of the
                            river, at present occupied by the Japanese, who already have consented
                            thereto, this work being estimated at 11,000 taels in all. The question
                            of the two other cuttings was also discussed in particular regarding the
                            possibility of finishing them also before the rainy season.</p>
                        <p>On the 4th of March the council sent to his excellency, Field Marshal
                            Count von Waldersee, in his quality of senior of the commanders in
                            chief, from whom the council derives its powers, a long memorandum
                            relating all that had happened.</p>
                        <p>This memorandum set forth that the cost of the whole work was estimated
                            at 500,000 taels, of which 300,000 taels would accomplish in four months
                            such work as would enable gunboats to ascend the river to the
                            concessions; that the foreign banks at Tientsin were ready to advance
                            the necessary loan at 7 per cent (instead of 6 per cent, as on the
                            former loan); that the Chinese Imperial maritime customs could hand
                            annually to the provisional government some 21,000 taels, levied on
                            Chinese merchandise and paid formerly to the authorities of the city.
                            This memorandum also stated that it would be just to free the
                            municipality of the British concession from the guaranty given and
                            include air the expenses of improving the navigability of the river in
                            the indemnity due from the Chinese Government, which has guaranteed that
                            free communication shall exist between Peking and the sea. It was
                            further proposed that until this indemnity shall be paid, each of the
                            powers having a representative on the council should advance the amount
                            of 50,000 taels, making in all 300,000 taels, which would permit to
                            start at once the most necessary work; that to avoid the contingency of
                            the Chinese controlling, at any day, the works and their <pb n="270"
                                xml:id="pg_270" facs="0276"/>maintenance, the consular body should
                            naturally be designated to succeed in this matter the provisional
                            government after its removal, and therefore it would be advisable for
                            said body to be represented on the provisional government’s commission,
                            and that, if extra dues on merchandise were to continue to be collected,
                            representatives of commerce, shipping, and foreign concessions ought
                            also to join.</p>
                        <p>Meantime the General Chamber of Commerce of Tientsin has prepared a
                            financial scheme and had forwarded it on March 2 to the consular body
                            with a proposal for administration, as follows:</p>
                        <p>Members of the commission: The senior consul or nominee of the consular
                            body; a member of the provisional government; the commissioner at
                            Tientsin of the Chinese Imperial maritime customs; one representative of
                            the shipping interests; a representative from each properly constituted
                            foreign municipality.</p>
                        <p>Among others this commission will have to assume full control of the
                            river works already created; accept all the obligations pertaining to
                            the scheme of 1898 now in existence; assume complete financial control;
                            appoint an expert consulting engineer.</p>
                        <p>Financial scheme: Out of the 150,000 taels, 6 per cent municipal loan of
                            1898, 130,000 taels are still outstanding.</p>
                        <p>As security for the payment of interest and amortization until August 1,
                            1910 (twelve years from August 1, 1898), 1 per cent is levied on duties
                            paid to the Chinese Imperial maritime customs. (The customs tariff being
                            generally based on a 5 per cent “ad valorem” duty, 1 per cent on duty is
                            the same as ½ per mill “ad valorem” given above.) This has been going on
                            regularly.</p>
                        <p>It is estimated that a further sum of 300,000 taels is needed for the new
                            works and an interest of 7 per cent instead of 6 per cent must be
                            provided for. As security for the payment of interest and amortization
                            the existing river dues of 1 per cent ought to be doubled, making the
                            levy 2 per cent on duties, and the period of collection ought to be
                            extended until 1923, or twenty-five years from the original date. This
                            would be sufficient to terminate the remaining 130,000 taels of the 8
                            per cent loan and the new 7 per cent loan of 300,000 taels in 1909 and
                            1919, respectively.</p>
                        <p>The amount collected was, after deducting the cost of collection, about
                            21,000 taels, fully sufficient to meet the financial requirements of the
                            1898 loan. In doubling the dues that will bring in 42,000 taels, which
                            would be sufficient to meet the requirements of the two loans.</p>
                        <p>In addition to that the chamber of commerce proposed that—</p>
                        <p>All lighters coming to the bund and wharves or discharging in the
                            Tientsin reach shall contribute 5 candareens per ton (dead weight) on
                            the cargo brought up in their own bottoms; provided always that such
                            charge shall not be made if the depth of water in any part of the river
                            between Taku and Tientsin be less than 9 feet.</p>
                        <p>All steamers coming to the bund and wharves or discharging in the
                            Tientsin reach shall likewise contribute 5 candareens per ton (dead
                            weight) on cargo brought up in their own bottoms.</p>
                        <p>Seagoing junks and sailing vessels reaching Tientsin shall also pay a
                            proportionate sum.</p>
                        <p>All revenue arising from any or all of the above sources to be applied as
                            follows, after deducting cost of collection: Two-thirds to the immediate
                            redemption of bonds, one-third to form a maintenance fund.</p>
                        <p>The chamber of commerce believes that the steamship companies will offer
                            no opposition to the proposals on the understanding that the levying of
                            dues (on duties and craft) will only remain in force so long as the
                            financial obligations named above exist.</p>
                        <p>The General Chamber of Commerce of Tientsin, representing the commercial
                            community of the place, forwarded on March 12 to the provisional
                            government copy of its two letters dated February 13 and March 2,
                            addressed to the consular body, acknowledging at the same time the keen
                            interest taken by the said provisional government in the improvement of
                            the navigability of the river.</p>
                        <p>According to this correspondence, the council of the provisional
                            government wrote again to his excellency, Field Marshal Count von
                            Waldersee, as senior commander in chief, showing that this financial
                            scheme was very onerous and could only come in force after a certain
                            time needed to have the sanction of the proper authorities to levy the
                            dues mentioned (notwithstanding that the former dues could not be
                            collected from subjects of certain powers), and therefore maintaining
                            its former proposal to include the amount in the indemnity due by the
                            Chinese Government and to receive from the powers represented in the
                            council the sum of 300,000 taels, necessary to execute the works at
                            once, as a loan to be redeemed on the payment of the indemnity by the
                            Chinese Government. If for any reason whatever this amount should not be
                            included in the indemnity, then the financial scheme of the chamber of
                            commerce could be adopted, and out of the proceeds of the loan the
                            300,000 taels <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0277"/>could be refunded
                            to the powers. There would be more time to thoroughly discuss and
                            prepare this scheme; being not in a hurry and things having quieted down
                            and a normal state of affairs having been resumed, there will be even
                            chance to get money at 6 per cent, which will be an important economy.
                            As regards the composition of the commission, it is absolutely necessary
                            that the council of the provisional government keep supreme control as
                            long as it is responsible to the commanders in chief. After that, the
                            consular body, the only element of the commission able to stand against
                            the Chinese authorities, should take its place. It is well understood
                            that seats on the commission must be reserved for representatives of
                            institutions, corporations, associations, companies, and others who
                            would contribute to the works and their maintenance, as well as for the
                            commissioner at Tientsin of the Chinese Imperial maritime customs.</p>
                        <p>On March 3–16 the consular body held a meeting to which were invited to
                            attend: One member of the provisional government, representatives of the
                            shipping companies, representatives of municipal councils or
                            administration of foreign concessions, and Mr. de Linde.</p>
                        <p>According to a decision taken at a previous meeting, the commissioner at
                            Tientsin of the Chinese Imperial maritime customs was not invited to
                            attend.</p>
                        <p>The senior consul having in his letter of February 15 to the provisional
                            government declared that the consular body could only accept suggestions
                            from the provisional government, the council of this body did not find
                            it necessary to be represented at the meeting.</p>
                        <p>At this meeting it was decided—</p>
                        <p>To establish a commission according to the proposal of the chamber of
                            commerce, with the exception of the member of the provisional government
                            and the commissioner of customs, and in place of the latter to ask,
                            through the diplomatic body in Peking, the two Chinese plenipotentiaries
                            negotiating actually with the foreign ministers to nominate a Chinese
                            official of the rank of taotai at least.</p>
                        <p>To ask the diplomatic body to confirm the authorization to levy the dues
                            of 1 per cent on customs duty and to raise it to 2 per cent.</p>
                        <p>To claim from the provisional government the implements having been used
                            for the former works and which might be in its hands.</p>
                        <p>To lay a protest before the diplomatic body in Peking so as to stop the
                            provisional government from doing anything that may interfere with the
                            previous works.</p>
                        <p>The balance of the chamber of commerce’s scheme was also approved, the
                            commission nominated as above to frame such rules and regulations
                            regarding the other points as it may find necessary.</p>
                        <p>Although everything was ready, the commission of the provisional
                            government did not want to begin work before having received the
                            approbation of the commanders in chief.</p>
                        <p>The result of all these schemes and correspondences was an understanding
                            between the doyen of the diplomatic body at Peking, acting for that
                            body, and his excellency, Field Marshal Count von Waldersee, as senior
                            commander in chief, acting for the commanders in chief, by which the
                            number of the members of the commission was reduced to three, viz: A
                            member of the provisional government, a member of the consular, body,
                            the commissioner at Tientsin of the Chinese Imperial maritime customs,
                            to whom were added, with consultative voice only, representatives of
                            commerce, shipping, and foreign concessions.</p>
                        <p>This commission was to examine the question of improving the navigability
                            of the Hai-Ho (Pei-Ho), technically and financially, and to take, in an
                            independent way, such steps as would satisfy all parties interested in
                            the matter.</p>
                        <p>Although this was agreed to at the end of March, it was only at the end
                            of April that it was communicated at Tientsin to the senior consul by
                            the doyen of the diplomatic body and to the council of the provisional
                            government by his excellency, Field Marshal Count von Waldersee.</p>
                        <p>The consular body having seen in its meeting of April 17–30 that the
                            composition of the commission was different from what it had proposed,
                            and finding a certain ambiguity in the Peking wording in regard to the
                            foreign concessions (one part of that body considering only as
                            concessions those having a regular municipal council, namely, the
                            British and French concessions and the German concession), has again
                            referred the matter to the doyen of the diplomatic body, who has only
                            now confirmed the decision agreed to with his excellency, Field Marshal
                            Count von Waldersee.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, the first meeting of the commission was held on May
                            9–22.</p>
                        <p>Major-General de Wogack, member of the council of the provisional
                            government of the district of Tientsin; Mr. L. C. Hopkins, His Britannic
                            Majesty’s consul-general and senior consul; and Mr. Detring,
                            commissioner of the Chinese Imperial maritime customs, being present and
                            constituting the commission.</p>
                        <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0278"/>
                        <p>It was decided that the works should be divided into three sections: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>Maintenance of the river in its actual state, for which the
                                    provisional government offers a monthly subsidy of 5,000 taels,
                                    and even more if necessary; the actual monthly expenses on this
                                    head are between 2,000 taels and 3,000 taels, not counting the
                                    wages of the engineer and others, who, being in the service of
                                    the provisional government, have freely given their time, care,
                                    and labor to this work. As” the commission for the improvement
                                    of the navigability of the Hai-Ho (Pei-Ho) is entirely
                                    independent of the provisional government, it must have its own
                                    staff entirely under its orders and quite distinct from the one
                                    belonging to the provisional government (according to the
                                    opinion expressed by the latter), and therefore the provisional
                                    government offers at first sight 2,000 taels, more than the
                                    running monthly expenses, so as to provide for the payment of a
                                    regularly specially appointed staff.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>Improvement of the navigablity of the river so as to allow
                                    gunboats and therefore steamers of a certain draft to come up
                                    the river to the foreign concessions. The total cost of these
                                    works is estimated at 500,000 taels, of which the provisional
                                    government undertakes to provide the half, viz, 250,000 taels;
                                    the provisional government is even ready to advance all the
                                    money needed, specially as in the beginning the expenses will be
                                    small, but will increase with the development of the works, with
                                    the understanding that it is to be repaid out of the funds
                                    raised by the commerce, shipping, and foreign concessions, all
                                    pecuniarily interested in the completion of the works. As the
                                    representatives of these interests have only consultative
                                    voices, the commission could choose among them a treasurer, and
                                    this would enable them to provide in an effective way that the
                                    funds are judiciously employed. It must not be overlooked that
                                    in the amount of indemnities claimed from China are some 126,000
                                    taels for damage done to the works already executed for the
                                    improvement of the navigability of the river, although there
                                    seems to exist some lien on this item.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>Maintenance of the navigability of the river when all the
                                    works of improvement shall be completed. There is no urgency in
                                    this matter and it could be discussed later when the works are
                                    nearing completion. It is most certain that all the parties
                                    interested—commerce, shipping, and concessions—will not protest
                                    against slight dues which will guarantee them the free
                                    navigation of the river up to the concessions.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore it was decided to call a meeting of all the members of the
                            commission including those having a consultative voice, who are: The
                            French consul, as president of the French municipal council; the
                            chairman of the municipal council of the British and extra-British
                            concessions; the consuls for Germany, Japan, Russia, Belgium, United
                            States of America, as representatives of their respective concessions;
                            the latter only if the project of the United States concession still
                            holds good; the commanding officers at Tientsin of the Italian and
                            Austro-Hungarian contingents, as representatives of the respective
                            concessions occupied by them under orders from their respective
                            legations; the chairman of the Tientsin general chamber of commerce, a
                            representative of the shipping companies.</p>
                        <p>To this effect Mr. Ed. Cousins, of Messrs. Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co.,
                            agents of the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company, the oldest shipping
                            company trading at this port, has been requested to call a meeting of
                            all the foreign shipping companies trading at this port and connecting
                            Tientsin, Tongku, and Taku between them and with coast and foreign
                            ports, to elect such a representative.</p>
                        <p>So as to avoid further misunderstanding and not to have to explain all
                            the facts in full detail at the meeting, it has also been decided to
                            draw up a memorandum as complete as possible, relating all that has
                            happened. This memorandum to be sent to any member of the commission,
                            including those with consultative voice, so that they may come to the
                            meeting fully enlightened on the subject.</p>
                        <p>At a meeting called by Mr. Ed. Cousins, and held on May 11–23, the agents
                            of the shipping companies elected as their representatives Mr. W.
                            Fisher, of Messrs. Butter-field &amp; Swire, agents of the China
                            Navigation Company, Limited.</p>

                            of article 12 of the Joint Note, His Majesty the Emperor of China
                            pledged himself “To reform the office of foreign affairs on the lines
                            which the powers shall indicate.” I have the honor to inform you by this
                            dispatch of the conclusions reached on this subject by my
                            colleagues.</p>
                        <p>Having established the fact that the Tsungli Yamen has in the forty years
                            of its existence abundantly demonstrated its incapacity to discharge the
                            duties devolving upon it, the representatives of the powers have thought
                            it necessary to substitute for it for the good of China and the
                            harmonious relations between the Empire and foreign Governments an
                            organization analogous to those existing in other countries.</p>
                        <p>They have thought it essential to give to the future office of foreign
                            affairs all the guarantees of competence, regularity, promptitude, and
                            wise administration, lacking which the former one has demonstrated its
                            incapacity, and without which the new one could not respond to its real
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>They have not had less in mind to place in the high position which
                            belongs to it in the Empire the board whose mission it is to settle, in
                            the name of the Emperor, questions which should occupy the first rank in
                            the preoccupations of China.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of the powers think, in the first place, that the
                            duties previously intrusted to the Tsungli Yamen were divided among a
                            too large number of personages, and that it is necessary to substitute
                            for the too divided and intangible responsibilities a more effective and
                            more direct responsibility.</p>
                        <p>They are of opinion that the Office of foreign affairs should have at its
                            head a single minister, whose rank, influence, and power correspond with
                            the exigencies of his situation. This minister shall have the title of
                            “President of the Office of Foreign Affairs,” should be a prince (Wang)
                            or a duke (Kung), and should consequently belong to the Imperial family.
                            He shall have two assistants, one of whom shall be chosen from among the
                            members of the Grand Council (Chun-Chi Chü), and the other shall have at
                            least the personal rank of president of one of the ministries or boards
                            (Pu). These three shall have exclusive charge of the direct relations
                            with the foreign diplomatic agents. They shall receive, each of them, a
                            salary in conformity with the high functions with which they will be
                            invested and in conformity with the usages obtaining in all civilized
                            countries. They shall receive, either separately or the three together,
                            the diplomatic agents who shall have to treat, in the name of their
                            Governments, business with China. When the business shall be of a
                            particularly important nature and the diplomatic agents shall express
                            the wish, the president of the Bureau of foreign affairs shall assist
                            personally, either alone or with his assistants, at the interviews asked
                            for. For it is only on account of the probable multiplicity of his
                            occupations and because his other obligations as member of the Imperial
                            family may prevent him from devoting all his time to his ministry, that
                            two collaborators are given him, but in reality it is he who has in the
                            conduct of affairs the principal duty and responsibility. It is his name
                            alone and his address which shall appear on the official correspondence
                            of the diplomatic agents, and his two colleagues, who have rank and
                            titles inferior to his, have particularly as their duty to treat current
                            business, while having nevertheless quality to treat the others.</p>
                        <p>The name of Tsungli Yamen, which recalls unpleasant memories and which
                            does not express sufficiently well the importance and the authority of
                            the power on which devolve under the responsibility of the order of the
                            Sovereign the highest functions in the state, is done away with. It
                            shall be replaced in virtue of an Imperial decree by that of Wai-wu Pu,
                            and in the order of official precedence the Wai-wu Pu shall pass before
                            the six Boards of Tribunals.</p>
                        <p>It is desirable that the three members of the Wai-wu Pu shall have as
                            extended <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0280"/>a knowledge as
                            possible of international questions and of the methods in vogue of
                            settling them in civilized countries. So as to have under this last
                            point of view an additional guarantee, it will be necessary that, under
                            the orders of the three members of the Wai-wu Pu, there shall be, with
                            the title of chief of bureau, two officials capable by their experience
                            and their personal competency to place the administration to which they
                            are associated in more complete harmony than was the Tsungli Yamen with
                            analogous organizations existing abroad. It would also be desirable that
                            one of these two high functionaries should know an European
                            language.</p>
                        <p>Such are the conditions laid down by the representatives of the powers
                            for the reform of the Office of Foreign Affairs of the Empire, and I
                            have the honor to request of your highness and your excellency to be
                            pleased to solicit from His Majesty the Emperor of China the necessary
                            measures to put the same into effect.</p>

                            honor to receive a communication from your excellency in which you
                            stated that in a letter dated the 22d of April, which you sent in the
                            name of the foreign representatives, you informed us of the conditions
                            laid down by them for the reform of the Office of Foreign Affairs of the
                            Empire, and you desire to know what action had been taken of this
                            communication.</p>
                        <p>In reply, we beg to say that on receipt of the communication referred to
                            we at once presented a special memorial to the throne on the subject,
                            and a rescript was issued ordering the Governmental Administrative Board
                            together with the Board of Civil Office to take the question into

                            will not be altered, but there are minute details to be decided, and
                            when this is done we will at once communicate with your excellency upon
                            the subject. In the meantime we send this reply for your excellency’s

                                to be issued throughout Chihli.</hi></head>
                        <p>In the spring and summer of last year north China was the scene of grave
                            disorders, and crimes without precedent against the laws of humanity
                            were committed by the Boxers and Imperial troops.</p>
                        <p>On June 11 the chancellor of the Japanese legation was barbarously
                            murdered at the Yung-ting gate; on June 20 the envoy plenipotentiary of
                            Germany was assassinated while going to the Tsungli Yamen to transact
                            public business; and from that day to August 14 the legations of all the
                            foreign powers at Peking were besieged and constantly attacked. At
                            Tientsin the foreign concessions were bombarded for three weeks with
                            heavy cannon, and repeatedly attacked by Imperial troops and hordes of
                            Boxers. Both at Peking and Tientsin many foreigners were killed and
                            wounded, and a great quantity of property owned by foreigners was
                            wantonly destroyed. Elsewhere, and particularly in the province of
                            Shensi, numbers of foreigners of different nations, chiefly
                            missionaries, were atrociously murdered, and in several places foreign
                            cemeteries were profaned and tombs destroyed.</p>
                        <p>The foreign governments, as soon as they received intelligence of these
                            doings, sent armies over sea to quell the disorders, protect their
                            nationals, and chastise the persons who were responsible. The Taku
                            forts, Peking, Tientsin, and Paoting, and other places were taken by
                            assault, and the Imperial troops and Boxers were everywhere overthrown
                            in numerous battles and encounters, thousands of them being slain and
                            the rest driven afar off, beyond the confines of Chihli. The princes and
                            high officers of state guilty of participation in the crimes against
                            foreigners have all been most severely punished, several having suffered
                            the death penalty in accordance with the commands of His Imperial
                            Majesty the Emperor of China. Provincial officials of all ranks have
                            also been punished according to their offenses.</p>
                        <p>Heavy indemnities have been exacted by all the foreign States, and all
                            civil and military examinations have been suspended for a period of five
                            years in localities where foreigners were murdered or cruelly
                            treated.</p>
                        <p>Condign punishment having thus been administered, and China, moreover,
                            having expressed regrets and having promised the other reparations
                            demanded by the foreign powers, friendly relations are now definitely
                            restored, and the foreign troops of all nationalities will gradually
                            return to their homes. Each power will retain a permanent guard to
                            protect its legations, certain places between Peking and the sea will be
                            occupied by foreign troops to preserve freedom of communication, and the
                            Taku forts and all others which might impede this freedom of
                            communication will be razed.</p>
                        <p>This proclamation is issued by the representatives of the foreign powers
                            so that all may know the true facts connected with the coming and going
                            of the allied forces.</p>
                        <p>It is also necessary that Chinese officials and people should take
                            warning from the events stated and exercise extreme care to prevent any
                            recurrence of disturbance or disorder.</p>

                        the question of the indemnity was brought up. It had been put on the order
                        of the day by me to ascertain whether some progress could not be made, and
                        the deadlock brought about by the refusal of the British Government to
                        accept the proposal made by Russia concerning the eventual raising of the
                        tariff to 10 per cent broken. The Russian minister stated that it seemed to
                        him highly desirable that the diplomatic corps should be informed whether
                        the vote taken on the 11th of June on the subject, which$ like all other
                        votes, was taken subject to the approval of the various Governments, had
                        been accepted or refused by them. A vote was taken, which resulted in all
                        the representatives accepting the Russian proposal, the Belgian minister
                        alone stating that his Government accepted the eventual increase of the
                        tariff to 10 per cent, <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0282"/>but that it
                        had not referred in its instructions to him as to the ultimate use of the
                        additional revenue thus derived.</p>
                    <p>I stated, as instructed by you, that the United States had no opposition to
                        make to the Russian proposal.</p>
                    <p>The British minister said that the modification introduced by him in the
                        original proposal of the Russian Government, by which all Governments were
                        to have the right to make such reservations as they thought proper before
                        negotiations concerning the increase of the tariff should commence (see my
                        No. 114, of June 11, 1901), and which he had at the time accepted, had not
                        met with the approval of his Government. Great Britain, Sir Ernest Satow
                        said, was more interested in trade in China than any other nation, and it
                        could not accept more than the 5 per cent effective tariff, except in
                        consideration for certain commercial advantages, especially the abolition of
                        likin. This eventual increase should, in the opinion of the British
                        Government, be more in the nature of a surtax, revocable in case the Chinese
                        Government did not carry out the concessions which it would have to make to
                        secure said increase, especially as regarded likin, but, being revocable, it
                        could not possibly be used as additional guaranty as proposed by Russia.</p>
                    <p>The British Government thought the desire of Russia would be fully met if it
                        was agreed that in case the revenues pledged for the payment of the interest
                        on the new debt proved insufficient, the powers, at the proper time, should
                        inquire what measures might be necessary to supply said deficit.</p>
                    <p>The Russian minister stated that his Government had no idea of blocking
                        commerce, in the advancement of which it took the liveliest interest, when
                        it asked, as an additional guaranty, for the eventual raising of the import
                        duties beyond 5 per cent. The interests of commerce and a stable guaranty
                        could both be insured. The credit of all the powers was not the same; some
                        had to show to the bankers through whom they would eventually have to float
                        China’s bonds that their risks were even less than they might suppose. The
                        additional guaranty which it was sought to obtain would not absorb all the
                        revenue derived from the increased tariff, possibly only a very small
                        proportion of it, especially as it was not sought to replace by it the
                        revenue derived from the salt gabelle; the balance of the increased tariff
                        could be used to secure desired commercial concessions. The necessity of the
                        case would determine the amount to be applied to the payment of interest,
                        and it was even possible that none of it might ever be so required, as he
                        fully concurred with the British minister and his other colleagues in the
                        belief that the Chinese would strenously endeavor to meet on time, and in
                        full, all their financial obligations, as they had always done in the
                        past.</p>
                    <p>The German minister thanked the Russian minister for the views he had
                        expressed on commercial reforms. It was because he entertained similar ones
                        that he had originally accepted the Russian proposal.</p>
                    <p>I stated that I had only accepted the Russian proposal on account of the
                        amendment introduced in it by the British minister, by which all of our
                        commercial rights were protected; that I could not have agreed to any
                        proposal detrimental to American commercial interests, or lose any of the
                        powerful leverage which a concession of an increase of the tariff on imports
                        gave us with the Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>After these various declarations on our part the subject was dropped, but it
                        is my belief that the declared intention of the various powers <pb n="277"
                            xml:id="pg_277" facs="0283"/>to abide by their former acceptance of the
                        Russian proposal may be a formal indication to the British Government that
                        some compromise on its part with Russia is imperatively demanded, and I
                        trust the deadlock occasioned by this disagreement may soon be broken.</p>
                    <p>The British minister then proposed that a vote be taken as to whether all the
                        powers were willing to fix finally the sum of 450,000,000 taels, which had
                        until now been considered only as an approximate one, as the amount of the
                        indemnity to be paid by China.</p>
                    <p>The Russian minister remarked that it was important to finally settle the
                        exact amount of the private claims, and if the sum total fell short of
                        450,000,000, the balance should be given back to China. If the diplomatic
                        corps was ready to accept unconditionally 450,000,000 taels, he was
                        also.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese minister, who had formerly stated that his Government could not
                        accept as a satisfactory settlement 4 per cent interest, declared that as
                        the British minister’s proposition was acceptable to all his colleagues, he,
                        too, would accept it unconditionally, subject to the approval of his
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>The Austrian and Belgian ministers accepted it on the same conditions as the
                        Japanese. There can be no doubt that they will receive the approval of their
                        respective Governments within a day or two.</p>
                    <p>A plan of amortization recently submitted to the diplomatic corps and
                        considered by that body as better than those previously examined, was also
                        accepted, and has been approved by the Chinese Government. * * * *</p>
                    <p>It was furthermore decided that a final protocol embodying all the results of
                        the past negotiations should be drawn up and signed by the foreign
                        representatives and the Chinese plenipotentiaries. This can be done, it is
                        believed, as soon as the Anglo-Russian difficulty no longer blocks the
                        way.</p>
                    <p>An answer was agreed upon to be sent to the Chinese plenipotentiaries
                        accepting the proposal made by them in a recent letter as to the place in
                        the palace to which the foreign representatives should be carried in sedan
                        chairs at Imperial audiences. This finally closes the question. I will
                        transmit copies of the correspondence in a special dispatch.</p>
                    <p>The conference then took up the question of the draft convention and
                        regulations prepared by a subcommittee, composed of the German, British, and
                        French ministers, and myself, for the organization of a conservancy board
                        for the Whangpu River. The draft was accepted, with some slight
                        modifications, and will be transmitted to the various Governments for
                        approval, on receipt of which it will be discussed with and I have no doubt
                        accepted by the Chinese Government. Within a day or two I will send you
                        copies of these documents with such explanations as they may require.</p>
                    <p>An answer to a recent Chinese note concerning the places in which
                        examinations are to be suspended, and the question of the suspension of the
                        metropolitan examinations, was then agreed upon. I will transmit copies of
                        this correspondence in a separate dispatch.</p>
                    <p>As indicated to you in several of my previous dispatches, the Russian
                        Government has shown much interest in the article of the Joint Note which
                        provides for the maintenance of the prohibition of the importation of arms
                        and ammunition into China. The Russian minister to-day brought up the
                        subject again. He said his Government was much interested in it, and asked
                        if the scheme submitted to the <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0284"
                        />conference had received the approval of the various Governments. It
                        appears that none have accepted it.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese and British ministers and I have repeatedly stated that, as to
                        the period during which we thought any prohibition should be enforced, our
                        Governments were in favor of the shortest possible; and the Japanese
                        minister having proposed two years, my British colleague and I have
                        expressed the preference of our respective Governments for that term.</p>
                    <p>The Russian Government would like to see it, as I have previously informed
                        you, enforced for a period of at least five years. Although I doubt the
                        practicability of the scheme, some attention has to be paid to it in view of
                        the insistence of the Russian Government.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my dispatch No. 75, of April 24 last, I had
                        the honor to transmit to you a copy of the letter of the dean of the
                        diplomatic corps to the Chinese plenipotentiaries, dated April 18, asking
                        for the creation of an international concession on the island of Ku-lang su,
                        at Amoy.</p>
                    <p>I transmit to you herewith the further correspondence exchanged with the
                        Chinese plenipotentiaries on this subject. From this it appears that the
                        delay in drawing up the regulations for the government of the proposed
                        concession is mainly attributable to most of the consuls at Amoy not having
                        been instructed by their Governments to take up the question with the taotai
                        of Amoy. The statement to this effect, made in the Chinese
                        plenipotentiaries’ note of July 13 (inclosure 3), is borne out by dispatches
                        received at this legation from our consul at Amoy.</p>
                    <p>I am informed by my colleagues that they have, within the last fortnight, had
                        instructions sent their respective consuls at Amoy to promptly take up the
                        subject with the taotai. Our consul has had such instructions since the 21st
                        of May last. I trust the matter may now be speedily settled. The regulations
                        agreed upon between the taotai and the consular body will be submitted to
                        the diplomatic corps for its approval.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: On the 30th of June we had the
                            honor to receive a communication from your excellency in the matter of
                            the creation of an international concession on the island of Kulangsu,
                            Amoy.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency states that the appearance of the plague at Amoy gives a
                            specially urgent character to your request, and the foreign
                            representatives direct you, therefore, to ask to be informed without
                            delay what action has been taken on the demand made in this matter.</p>
                        <p>In reply we beg to observe that we have repeatedly telegraphed the
                            Viceroy of the Min-Che provinces, Hsu, to issue instructions to have
                            this matter satisfactorily arranged. On the 16th of May we again
                            telegraphed the viceroy urging action in the premises, and on the 27th
                            idem we received a telegraphic reply to the effect that in the matter of
                            the creation of an international concession on the island of Kulangsu,
                            the United States consul, Mr. Johnson, came to Foochow and discussed the
                            general plan or outline of the rules (to govern the concession), and the
                            viceroy ordered Ing Men to assume charge of the Amoy taotaiship so that
                            he may properly discuss the various details. On an understanding having
                            been reached and the agreement signed the same is to be transmitted to
                            the viceroy.</p>
                        <p>On receiving the above telegram we at once telegraphed to Foochow urging
                            that the matter be brought to a decision, and on receiving a telegraphic
                            reply we will again communicate with your excellency asking you to bring
                            the matter to the attention of the foreign representatives.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: Some time ago we had the honor
                            to receive your excellency’s communication in which you stated that the
                            appearance of the plague at Amoy (gives a specially urgent character to
                            your request) in the matter of the international settlement on the
                            island of Kulangsu, and we were urged to telegraph the proper
                            authorities pressing for a speedy arrangement of it.</p>
                        <p>At the time we telegraphed Viceroy Hsu, of the Min-Che provinces, urging
                            action in the premises. We have now received a wire in reply,
                            acknowledging receipt of our telegram and informing us that he in turn
                            wired Yen taotai, who reported that he had repeatedly urged the consular
                            body to take up the matter of the concession and discuss it with him,
                            but they informed him that they must wait until they hear from their
                            ministers, hence the delay resulting in nothing having been
                            accomplished. The viceroy begs us to communicate with the foreign
                            representatives, asking them to telegraph their respective consuls at
                            Amoy urging them to lose no time in taking up this matter.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the question of an international settlement on the island of
                            Kulangsu the foreign representatives, in urging that telegraphic
                            instructions be sent to Amoy to speedily arrange the matter, no doubt
                            did it at the request of the foreign consuls. How is it, then, that the
                            taotai, on approaching the consuls with a view to arranging the matter,
                            is told that they must await instructions from their ministers? There
                            must be a reason for this.</p>
                        <p>We have the honor, therefore, to address your excellency, and will thank
                            you to lay this matter before your colleagues, asking them to telegraph
                            their consuls at Amoy to take it up as soon as possible, in a friendly
                            way, and arrange a satisfactory settlement which may prove beneficial to
                            both countries.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit herewith for your
                        information further correspondence between the dean of the diplomatic corps
                        and the Chinese plenipotentiaries concerning the ceremonial to be followed
                        at audiences with His Majesty the Emperor.</p>
                    <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0286"/>
                    <p>In my dispatch No. 106, of June 4, I expressed the opinion that the question
                        would not be completely settled until after the Emperor’s return to Peking.
                        The demand which the Chinese plenipotentiaries seemed quite unable to grant
                        was that the representatives of the powers should be carried in sedan chairs
                        to the hall in which the audiences were to be given them. On the 10th
                        instant, however, the Chinese plenipotentiaries offered to compromise by
                        granting the foreign representatives the right to be borne to the foot of
                        the steps of the outer entrance of the audience hall in small palace sedan
                        chairs, a right enjoyed by no subject of the Emperor—not even by his father.
                        This has been accepted by the ministers (inclosure 3) and the question is
                        consequently closed.</p>
                    <p>The points conceded to the powers in the negotiations are embodied in the
                        memorandum which I inclose herewith.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: On the 2d of July we had the
                            honor to receive a communication (from the doyen) concerning the
                            ceremonial at audiences, in which it is stated that the foreign
                            representatives accept our proposal concerning the use of green chairs
                            with yellow trimmings. But as to the question of the foreign
                            representatives getting out of their sedan chairs at the Chien-ching
                            gate, it would seem that in this case there would not be sufficient
                            distinction made to the ceremonial in the case of visits of an heir to
                            the throne or a prince of the royal blood to Peking. Besides, the Chien
                            Ching gate is not far distant from the Chien-ching Kung, hence we still
                            find it inconvenient to memorialize the Throne in the matter.</p>
                        <p>If the foreign representatives can see their way to accept our former
                            proposal to leave their chairs outside of the Chien-ching gate, then
                            this will fully show that they are willing to make especial allowances
                            in the case, and not cause us to be placed in a difficult position; for
                            such a manifestation of kindness we would very gratefully remember. In
                            the event, however, of their not agreeing to this proposal we have to
                            say that, as an additional compromise, we propose that the foreign
                            representatives change chairs outside the Ching-yun gate, and proceed in
                            small chairs (i chiao) to the steps of the Chien-ching gate and there
                            alight. We may state that princes, dukes, or high ministers of state
                            have hitherto never been accorded this privilege. This will be treating
                            the foreign representatives with great courtesy.</p>
                        <p>As in duty bound, we address this communication to your excellency, and
                            will trouble you to again lay the matter before your colleagues for
                            their consideration and favor us with an early reply, so that it may be
                            shortly decided on.</p>

                        <p>1. Solemn audiences given by His Majesty the Emperor of China to the
                            diplomatic corps or to separate representatives of the powers shall take
                            place in the hall of the palace called “Chien-ching Kung.”</p>
                        <p>2. In going to and returning from solemn audiences the representatives of
                            the powers shall be borne in their chairs to the outside of the
                            Ching-yun gate. At the Ching-yun gate they shall alight from the chairs
                            in which they have come and will be borne in small chairs (i chiao) to
                            the foot of the steps of the Chien-ching gate.</p>
                        <p>Arriving at the Chien-ching gate, the representatives of the powers shall
                            alight from their chairs and proceed on foot into the presence of His
                            Majesty in the Chien-ching Kung hall.</p>
                        <p>On leaving, the ministers shall return to their residences in the same
                            manner in which they came.</p>
                        <p>3. When a representative of a power shall have to present to His Majesty
                            the Emperor his letters of credence or a communication from the chief of
                            the state by whom he is accredited, the Emperor shall cause to be sent
                            to the residence of the representative a sedan chair with the yellow
                            trimmings and tassels, such as are used by princes of the Imperial
                            family, to convey him to the palace. He shall be reconducted in the same
                            manner.</p>
                        <p>An escort of troops will also be sent to the residence of the
                            representative to accompany him to and from the palace.</p>
                        <p>4. When presenting his letters of credence, or communications from the
                            Head of the State by whom he is accredited, the diplomatic
                            representative, while bearing said letters or communications, shall pass
                            through the central openings in the doors or gates in the palace until
                            he has reached the presence of His Majesty. On returning from such
                            audiences he shall comply, as regards the doors and gates through which
                            he may have to pass, to the usage already established at the court of
                            Peking for audiences given to foreign representatives.</p>
                        <p>5. The Emperor shall receive directly into his hands the above-mentioned
                            letters or communications which the diplomatic representatives may have
                            to give to him.</p>
                        <p>6. Should His Majesty the Emperor, at any time, see fit to invite the
                            representatives of the powers to a banquet, it is understood that such
                            banquet shall take place in one of the halls of the imperial palace, and
                            that His Majesty shall be present in person.</p>
                        <p>7. In a word, the ceremonial adopted by China toward foreign
                            representatives shall not, under any circumstances, be different from
                            that which results from perfect equality between the countries concerned
                            and China, without any loss of prestige on either side.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In further reference to the question of the
                        suspension of examinations and as supplementing my dispatch No. 119, of June
                        18, I have the honor to transmit copies of correspondence recently exchanged
                        between the diplomatic corps and the Chinese plenipotentiaries.</p>
                    <p>In my dispatch No. 109 I expressed the hope that the British minister would
                        not insist on the total suspension of the metropolitan examinations, which
                        are held in Peking. The reference to the subject of these examinations in
                        the note of the 19th instant of the dean of-the diplomatic corps to the
                        Chinese plenipotentiaries is as vague as the terms of the Imperial edict of
                        June 11 on the subject, which we had accepted as satisfactorily disposing of
                        the matter. The British minister takes it that by the terms of this edict
                        the metropolitan examinations are absolutely prohibited; the other members
                        of the conference <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0288"/>are not willing
                        to press the subject, and prefer not to force an interpretation of the
                        edict, especially as the majority is satisfied that these examinations
                        should only be closed to candidates from provinces in which foreigners were
                        killed or maltreated during last year’s troubles.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: On the 2d of July we had the
                            honor to receive a communication from your excellency in which you say
                            that as regards the suspension of all examinations where trouble
                            occurred, Article X of the Joint Note states that a decree suspending
                            the examinations shall be posted through the whole Empire. Your
                            excellency requests us, in the name of the representatives of the
                            powers, to take the necessary measures so that that formality may be
                            complied with without delay.</p>
                        <p>In reply, we would beg to observe that in the matter of the suspensions
                            of examinations, there are still three points that remain unsettled: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The metropolitan examinations at Peking. We asked that these
                                    should be exempt from the prohibition, but on the 30th of June
                                    we received your excellency’s communication in reply, in which
                                    you stated that it was necessary to take this matter into
                                    careful consideration. At the present moment we are not aware
                                    whether the matter has been clearly investigated or not.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Ho-chien Fu in Chihli. It appears that no foreigners were
                                    massacred or cruelly treated there, and the prohibition should
                                    not include this place. In the communication of the 30th of June
                                    your excellency also stated that this matter must await an
                                    investigation by the foreign representatives, when your
                                    excellency would address us on the subject. No reply, however,
                                    has been received.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>On the 2d of July we addressed your excellency a communication
                                    stating that the governor of Honan had telegraphed us to the
                                    effect that at the following places (five) in Honan, namely,
                                    Nan-yang Fu, Kuang-chou Fu, Chen-chou Fu, Cheng Chou, and
                                    Ho-nei, no foreigners were massacred or subjected to cruel
                                    treatment, and the examinations there should not be suspended.
                                    To this communication we have also not been favored with a
                                    reply.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>We have the honor, therefore, to request your excellency to bring the
                            above questions to the notice of the foreign representatives so that
                            they may speedily consider them and an early reply be sent us, to the
                            end that we may again memorialize the Throne, asking the issuance of a
                            decree to be posted throughout the Empire in accordance with the terms
                            of the Joint Note.</p>

                            in the Imperial decree of the 11th of June, which you transmitted to me
                            in your letter of the 13th of June, and which the representatives of the
                            powers accepted in a letter of the 1st of July.</p>
                        <p>As a consequence, the foreign representatives have no objections to the

                        <p>As to the five localities in Honan, in which, according to the governor
                            of that province, no foreigner was massacred or maltreated, the foreign
                            representatives, considering that it results from precise information
                            which they have received that foreigners were cruelly treated at
                            Nan-yang Fu and Kuang Chou, insist on the suspension of examinations in
                            these two localities, whereas for the three others (Chen-chou Fu, Cheng
                            Chou, and Ho-nei Hsien) they agree, in a spirit of conciliation, that
                            examinations shall not be suspended.</p>
                        <p>As regards the metropolitan examinations, the foreign representatives
                            direct me to inform you that they must refer to the terms of the
                            Imperial decree of the 11th of June, which they have recognized as
                            satisfactory by the letter of their dean of the 1st of July.</p>

                            <p>I am ready to accept, in the name of my Government, the condition
                                annexed to the declaration just made by his excellency the minister
                                of Russia—that his Government does not insist at the present moment
                                on the eventual raising of the import duties beyond 5 per cent as a
                                reserve guaranty. I do this the more readily since it agrees with
                                the proposal which I submitted to my colleagues in our last
                                meeting.</p>
                            <p>As to the declaration which his excellency the Russian minister has
                                just added, I <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0290"/>am obliged to
                                say that I consider it as a declaration coming only from the
                                Government which makes it, and that I am not authorized to change
                                anything in what I have already said concerning the reserve
                                guaranty.</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. de Giers, the Russian minister, remarked on this that his declaration
                        could apply not only to his Government, but to those others which might hold
                        the same views.</p>
                    <p>The ministers of Japan, Belgium, and Austria having declared that their
                        Governments agreed to the indemnity of 450,000,000 Haikwan taels, with rate
                        of interest at 4 per cent, a note was ordered to be prepared, to be sent to
                        the Chinese plenipotentiaries, embodying these conclusions. The conference
                        furthermore agreed that, as the indemnity and interest were payable in gold,
                        the 450,000,000 Haikwan taels should be converted into gold at the rate of
                        exchange of April 1, 1901. The United States Treasury rate on that date was
                        1 Haikwan tael =$0.742 United States gold.</p>
                    <p>The question of the final protocol, in which the results of the negotiations
                        are to be embodied, and in which are also to be incorporated all the details
                        concerning the mode of payment of the indemnity and probably the arrangement
                        for the creation of the Whangpu conservancy board and the regulations
                        governing it, was also considered, and a committee directed to draft it.</p>
                    <p>The maintenance of the prohibition of the importation of arms was then taken
                        up.</p>
                    <p>The British minister said that his Government thought the scheme suggested by
                        the diplomatic corps difficult to carry out, and that furthermore it was
                        contingent on legislation by the various powers, and that the Chinese
                        Government could prohibit all importation of such articles and the maritime
                        customs could be entrusted with the enforcement.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese minister shared these views, and added that his Government was
                        of opinion that permission should be granted China to import the arms and
                        ammunition necessary to the interior policing of the country.</p>
                    <p>The Austrian and Italian ministers were also in favor of a term of two
                        years.</p>
                    <p>I stated to my colleagues the views contained in your telegram of the 29th
                        instant. I greatly doubt whether any arrangement can be reached by the
                        powers on this question beyond asking China to enforce the prohibition
                        against herself—not a very satisfactory solution.</p>
                    <p>The Russian minister thought there were grave inconveniences to intrusting
                        the prohibition of the importation of arms and ammunition to China itself,
                        and that the measures suggested in the scheme submitted to the diplomatic
                        corps were not too rigorous.</p>
                    <p>I have the honor, etc.,</p>

                                of the allied forces, held at Tientsin the 16th of July, under the
                                presidency of Division General Voyron</hi>.</head>

                        <p>The conference of the commanders in chief, held on the 16th of April,
                            under the presidency of his excellency, Field Marshal Count von
                            Waldersee, has considered the consequences of Articles VIII and IX of
                            the terms of peace, and had, in particular, enumerated the
                            fortifications to be demolished and the garrisons to be left in Pechili
                            by the different contingents. There remained to settle the measures for
                            carrying these into effect and to fix more precisely certain
                            details.</p>
                        <p>Division General Voyron, commander in chief of the French expeditionary
                            force, and senior of the commanders in chief, had consequently called
                            the meeting. All were present at the meeting, which began at 10 a.m.,
                            with the exception of Major Robertson, of the United States Army.
                            Brigade General Sucillon, chief of the staff of the French expeditionary
                            force, acted as secretary.</p>
                        <p>A letter of Major Robertson, dated the 14th of July, was read. In it he
                            stated that the United States not having at present any military
                            interest in the subjects under discussion, consequently he would not be
                            present at the conference.</p>
                        <p>Division General Voyron briefly outlined the plan for the evacuation of
                            Pechili by the expeditionary forces. It is to compose two periods:</p>
                        <p>First. Departure of the bulk of the troops and establishment along the
                            lines of communication between Peking and the sea, in summer or in
                            winter, of the garrisons necessary to insure security; maintenance at
                            Tientsin of a supplementary contingent of 4,000 men until China has
                            proved her determination to preserve order.</p>
                        <p>The ministers accredited to the Chinese Government had already taken the
                            opinion of the troops of their respective nationalities on the question
                            under discussion; the commanders very nearly agree on the way of
                            settling them, and there are only divergencies of view, on questions of
                            detail, which it will be very easy to harmonize.</p>
                        <p>1. The first question submitted to discussion was that of the
                            jurisdiction of posts established on the railroad
                            Peking-Shanhaikwan.</p>
                        <p>After having stated to the members of the conference the views which each
                            one of them had communicated to the diplomatic corps, General Voyron
                            remarked that the duty of the allied contingents was defined by the Very
                            fact of their maintenance of the province of Chili, to insure security
                            of communications between Peking and the sea. The localities assigned to
                            each nation had been settled upon. There was no discussion about the
                            policing of the railway stations being reserved to the British troops;
                            the allied troops will have to look after the security of the line
                            halfway to the next station.</p>
                        <p>For the protection of the flanks of the line, it was indispensable that
                            an understanding should exist between the contingents, and that each
                            post should inform its neighbors of any event, and, if it should be
                            indispensable, should give aid and assistance to its neighbors.</p>
                        <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0292"/>
                        <p>In case of a movement appearing serious, the commanders in chief present
                            at Tientsin would have to meet to take a joint decision.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the direction there are two systems: (1) The designation of a
                            general commander in chief with authority ad hoc over all contingents;
                            (2) the collective commanders in chief who would decide jointly.</p>
                        <p>Lieutenant-General de Lessel and General Gaselee were of opinion that
                            there should be no commander in chief, and furthermore the settlement of
                            this question depended exclusively on the diplomatic corps. The other
                            commanders in chief accepted these views.</p>
                        <p>Until this point shall have been settled the committee of the commanders
                            in chief shall decide, when necessary, on the measures to be taken and
                            the operations to be carried out. It will meet upon the call of its
                            president whenever he shall deem it necessary or on the request of one
                            of its members, who shall state the reasons for his asking. The call
                            shall be made in the form used in the meeting of this day.</p>
                        <p>As to the jurisdiction of the commanders of posts, General Voyron stated
                            that it only concerned crimes or misdemeanors committed by Chinese
                            against the railway, the telegraphic communications, or on the persons
                            and goods of soldiers of the allied troops. It belonged to the
                            contingents to determine themselves their judicial action for the
                            repression of these crimes or misdemeanors by applying their respective
                            military laws. It is well understood that the repressive action of the
                            contingents, being only of a purely military object, shall not be
                            exercised against Chinese injuring other Chinese; these are exclusively
                            under native jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>Lieutenant-General de Lessel proposed that jurisdiction shall be
                            exercised over a strip of 2 miles to the right and to the left of the
                            railroad and under the conditions indicated above. Colonel Garioni
                            observed that if evil doers should be discovered and pursued, the troops
                            can not be stopped by the existence of this limit. It was agreed that
                            offenders could be pursued wherever it might be necessary.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Garioni asked what would be the relation of military posts to the
                            regular Chinese troops in the neighborhood. It was agreed that if they
                            had occasion to undertake any policing operations they should ask for
                            permission to cross (the railroad zone).</p>
                        <p>General Voyron remarked that the question of jurisdiction offered a
                            peculiarity at Tientsin in view of the existence of the council of the
                            provisional government of the Chinese City, which was nothing more than
                            emanation of the commanding officers of the allied forces. This body had
                            made notable progress, and it would seem desirable that all the
                            contingents should let it continue its functions for some time to come.
                            The general opinion was that it was advisable to retain it to the second
                            period of the occupation; that is to say, until the total of the
                            garrisons should reach only 6,000 men. When that time came, the council
                            of commanders in chief could come to a decision as to doing away with
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Lieutenant-General de Lessel thought that even after the suppression of
                            the council of the provisional government, when the troops of each
                            nationality would be exclusively within their respective concessions, it
                            would be necessary to exercise some control over the Chinese authorities
                            to safeguard the interests at Tientsin of the important body of troops.
                            The conference was of this opinion. The method of carrying it out will
                            be examined at the proper time.</p>
                        <p>Second. The second question concerned the destruction of Chinese
                            fortifications which might prevent free communication between Peking and
                            the sea. A list of these was drawn up on the 6th of April.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Garioni, while accepting in principle the destruction of the
                            forts at Taku and Shanhaikwan, thought it might be advisable to preserve
                            these forts as a naval base and that it would be preferable to leave to
                            the council of admirals the care of fixing the time when they should be
                            destroyed.</p>
                        <p>Lieutenant-General de Lessel thought, on the contrary, that these works,
                            like the others, should be destroyed as soon as possible. General
                            Voyron, General Gaselee, Major-General Yamane, and Colonel Glinsky were
                            of the same opinion.</p>
                        <p>The proposition of Colonel Garioni not having been accepted by the
                            majority of the council, the commander of the Italian troops proposed
                            that the destruction of these works should take place as late as
                            possible—i. e., at the time when the allied forces shall evacuate
                            Pechili. This motion was also not accepted.</p>
                        <p>As to the ways and means of carrying out the work, General Voyron
                            proposed that the destruction of the works should take place at the
                            expense of the Chinese Government, who would supply and pay the laborers
                            necessary. This proposal was accepted.</p>
                        <p>General Voyron proposed furthermore that the council of the provisional
                            government of the Chinese City should be intrusted with the direction
                            and execution of all the work on its territory. This proposal was also
                            adopted.</p>
                        <p>Lieutenant-General Gaselee proposed that the supervision of all these
                            works should <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0293"/>be given to a
                            commission of technical officers of various nationalities so as to guard
                            against accidents which might occur during the work.</p>
                        <p>Lieutenant-General de Lessel objected that there was no grounds for this
                            apprehension as regards the work to be done by the provincial
                            government, which had a competent staff, and that the intervention of a
                            technical commission in these works would only be a source of
                            difficulty.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that the duties of the technical commission should only
                            extend to the works to be done outside of the area of the provisional
                            board. Each of the commanders of the allied forces shall designate an
                            officer to serve on it and shall communicate his name to General
                            Voyron.</p>
                        <p>General Gaselee remarked that some of the works to be destroyed, such as
                            the Chinese camps, had no military value; they consisted of cantonments
                            surrounded by an ordinary wall. They might be preserved. This view was
                            accepted.</p>
                        <p>Major-General Yamane asked that when a work was destroyed an officer of
                            the nationality occupying it should be designated to come to an
                            understanding with the council of the provisional government and the
                            technical commission of the location and arrangement of the barracks and
                            buildings to be preserved.</p>
                        <p>It was furthermore agreed that the destruction of the forts was to be
                            confined to the parapets, embankments, platforms, and, in general, to
                            those portions which had an offensive or defensive character, but not to
                            the buildings, barracks, etc., which might be useful to the allied
                            contingents.</p>
                        <p>General Voyron put before the council the question of handing over to the
                            British military authorities Fort No. 1 at Shanhaikwan, otherwise called
                            the International Fort. As long as this work, the only one which has a
                            sea front, was armed, there could be no question of leaving it to a
                            single power; but when the parapet shall have been demolished and when
                            it shall be no longer armed General Voyron had, personally, no objection
                            to this fort being assigned to the British troops solely.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Glinsky was of the same opinion, subject to the same
                            reservation.</p>
                        <p>General Gaselee stated that it was well understood that Fort No. 3 should
                            be razed, and that only the barracks and storehouses should be
                            preserved.</p>
                        <p>Fort No. 1 being reserved to the British troops, it was agreed, on the
                            request of General Yamane, that the Japanese troops alone should occupy
                            Fort No. 4.</p>
                        <p>Third. The third question discussed concerned the permission to be given
                            the Chinese regulars to enter Peking.</p>
                        <p>General Voyron stated that until recently, under an understanding between
                            him and General de Lassel, regulars had not been authorized to cross to
                            the left bank of the Ta-Tsin-Ho. During the last few days, at the
                            request of the diplomatic corps, their presence had been tolerated to a
                            distance of 20 li of Peking. The diplomatic corps is of opinion that at
                            the present time they might enter the capital.</p>
                        <p>General Voyron thought that the regulars might be authorized to enter
                            Peking on condition that the commanders of the allied forces shall be
                            previously made aware of their numbers; of the names of the chiefs
                            commanding them; of the quarters where they are to be camped, and of
                            their distribution in these quarters. Lieutenant-General de Lessel was
                            of the opinion that with the guarantees asked for by General-Voyron,
                            authorization might be granted.</p>
                        <p>Lieutenant-General Gaselee was of opinion that the regulars should not be
                            allowed to come. General Garioni was of the same opinion.</p>
                        <p>General Voyron observed that when the allied troops shall have evacuated
                            Peking, the regulars will immediately enter it; that the Chinese will
                            not fail to say that their presence has put to flight the European
                            troops. If on the contrary, during a certain period, the allied forces
                            remained in Peking jointly with the Chinese troops, the people would see
                            that the former evacuate the capital of their own free will and at their
                            convenience.</p>
                        <p>These views are unanimously accepted, and it is decided that, until new
                            orders, 3,000 regulars may be authorized to enter Peking.</p>
                        <p>Fourth. The fourth question was that of the evacuation of Peking.</p>
                        <p>Major-General Yamane asked that a day be fixed for that purpose. He
                            proposed as the date the 14th of August, the anniversary of the taking
                            of the capital by the allied forces.</p>
                        <p>Lieutenant-General Gaselee proposed the 15th of August, which was agreed
                            to. It was agreed that each contingent shall leave the capital, leaving
                            only behind the troops necessary for guards at the legations, according
                            to the requirements of its particular plan of evacuation which depends
                            on the arrival of its transports, etc.</p>
                        <p>General Voyron said that the French troops would be able to leave about
                            the 10th of August. Lieutenant-General Gaselee stated that the British
                            troops would leave about the 18th of August.</p>
                        <p>No objections were raised.</p>
                        <p>The meeting closed at 11.45.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General</hi>: The minister of France has
                            communicated to the representatives of the powers the minutes of the
                            conference of the commanders in chief of the allied forces, held at
                            Tientsin, the 16th of July, under your presidency.</p>
                        <p>I am directed to inform you, as president of said conference, of the
                            views of the representatives of the powers on the different questions on
                            which the commanders in chief of the allied forces have expressed their
                            opinion.</p>
                        <p>As to the first question, that of the jurisdiction of the posts along the
                            railroad line—Peking–Shanhaikwan—the representatives of the powers find
                            no objection to the solution adopted by the conference of the commanders
                            in chief, and mentioned in the minutes under No. 1.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of the powers admit, furthermore, the observations
                            contained in the letter addressed to you, under date of the 19th of
                            July, by General von Lessel, on the protection of railway stations.</p>
                        <p>As regards the question of pursuing malefactors detected in the act of an
                            attempt against the railroad or the telegraph line, or against the
                            persons or goods of soldiers of the allied forces, the representatives
                            of the powers hold the same opinion as Colonel Garioni, but wish that,
                            with the exception of the case of flagrante delicto, the search,
                            pursuit, and arrest for the purpose of handing over the guilty to the
                            military authorities, shall be performed, when outside of the limit of 2
                            miles, by the Chinese authorities.</p>
                        <p>As to the question of the maintenance and the eventual suppression of the
                            provisional government of Tientsin, the foreign representatives have
                            expressed the opinion that this question having been submitted to their
                            respective governments, it is proper that it should be reserved.</p>
                        <p>An agreement having been reached by the commanders in chief of the allied
                            forces on the conditions under which should take place the destruction
                            of the Chinese forts which can prevent free communication between Peking
                            and the sea, a list of which was drawn up in the meeting of the 6th of
                            April, the foreign representatives give their assent to the conclusions
                            reached by the conference and have directed me to notify the Chinese
                            Government of the duties devolving upon it in the premises.</p>
                        <p>As regards the entry of Chinese regulars into Peking, the foreign
                            representatives propose to examine this question conjointly with their
                            military authorities and the Chinese plenipotentiaries.</p>
                        <p>As to the date of the evacuation of Peking, the foreign representatives
                            accept the proposals made to them by the commanders in chief of the
                            allied forces.</p>
                        <p>Please accept, general, the assurances of my highest consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, No. 1182, in which you are
                            so kind as to transmit to me the minutes of the conference of the 16th
                            instant.</p>
                        <p>I have only to make the two following observations:</p>
                        <p>1. On page 2 it is said “there is no discussion on the fact of the
                            policing of the railway stations being reserved to the British troops,”
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>While admitting that the policing of the stations should be performed by
                            those who have the working of the line, it seems to me useful to
                            establish the fact that the responsibility devolving on the various
                            commanders of posts for the security of the line extends also to the
                            security of the stations themselves, and that, consequently, these
                            commanders, without interfering in the police business proper, should be
                            independent as regards the measures they may take to guarantee the
                            security of the stations and buildings pertaining thereto against
                            attacks from whomever it may be.</p>
                        <p>2. On page 7 it is stated: “General Gaselee stated that it was well
                            understood that Fort No. 3 should be razed,” etc.</p>
                        <p>It would seem that an error has occurred here; instead of Fort No. 3 it
                            should be Fort No. 1.</p>

                        yesterday’s date, in which I stated that a note had been ordered drafted by
                        the diplomatic corps to be sent to the Chinese plenipotentiaries accepting
                        the indemnity, I have to transmit to you herewith a translation of the
                        French text of the note as finally agreed upon in a meeting held by the
                        diplomatic corps to-day.</p>
                    <p>The provision in the note by which the Chinese Government is granted three
                        years to pay off the first half-yearly amount of interest due on the
                        indemnity was inserted at the request of Sir Robert Hart.</p>
                    <p>The representatives of the powers discussed also the question of the date on
                        which the new tariff should go into effect. All were in favor of its being
                        applied immediately after the signing of the final protocol, excepting only
                        goods in transit to China, with the exception of the Japanese minister and
                        myself. We thought that two or three months’ notice should be given.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Highness, Excellency</hi>: You were pleased to
                            inform me in your letter of the month of May that an Imperial edict had
                            approved of the sum of 450,000,000 haikwan taels, with interest at 4 per
                            cent, to be paid to the powers, and had ordered you to take the
                            necessary steps to carry out the Imperial decision.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of the powers, to whom I hastened to communicate your
                            letter, direct me to inform you that they take note of this decision,
                            and that the sum of 450,000,000 haikwan taels, payable in gold at the
                            rate of exchange of April 1, 1901, with interest at 4 per cent,
                            represents the final total of the indemnities asked by the powers.</p>
                        <p>They have directed me, furthermore, to transmit to you a scheme of
                            amortization, which exactly complies with the wishes of your highness
                            and your excellency as to the paying off of the capital and
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>The service of amortization, properly so called, will commence, as is
                            shown in the annexed table, on the 1st of January, 1902, and will extend
                            over the period comprised between the years 1902 and 1940,
                            inclusive.</p>
                        <p>China will consequently only have to pay on the 1st of January, 1902,
                            interests on the sum of 450,000,000 haikwan taels for the period of six
                            months extending from the 1st of July, 1901, to the 1st of January,
                            1902. Nevertheless, so as to give to China facilities for paying off
                            these arrears the powers are willing that the amount should be divided
                            over a period of three years, from 1902 to 1905, on condition that
                            compound interest shall be allowed them.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the representatives of the powers have also requested me to
                            inform you of the revenues which they have decided to assign as
                            guaranties of the bonds: <list>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In several dispatches I have referred to the
                        subject of the creation of a river conservancy board at Shanghai, for the
                        improvement of the navigation of the Whangpu River. I now have the honor to
                        transmit a draft of an agreement, with annexed regulations, accepted by the
                        diplomatic representatives and which will undoubtedly be agreed to by the
                        Chinese plenipotentiaries. It is not yet decided whether this arrangement
                        shall take the form of a separate instrument or be incorporated in the Final
                        Protocol, the Russian minister having heretofore declared himself against
                        any treaty or convention with China on any of the pending questions.</p>
                    <p>The main features of the agreement are the creation of an international
                        conservancy board in which the Chinese Government and all the local
                        interests of Shanghai are represented, and, secondly, the division of the
                        expenses of the works between the Chinese Government and the foreign
                        community of Shanghai in about equal shares.</p>
                    <p>The financial cooperation of the Chinese Government and the present
                        consideration of this whole subject were secured by us as one of the
                        conditions to our accepting an increase of the import tariff to 5 per cent
                        effective.</p>
                    <p>The additional taxes on shipping, merchandise, and real estate in the foreign
                        concessions and settlements at Shanghai meet with the approval of the
                        General Chamber of Commerce and the consular corps, and can not be
                        considered burdensome. I trust you will approve of my action in agreeing to
                        these additional taxes, which seem to me highly proper in principle and will
                        result in so great a benefit to Shanghai. It will doubtless be highly
                        satisfactory to our Government to know that it has been able to bring about
                        the settlement of this question, which for forty years has engrossed the
                        attention of the foreign mercantile community of Shanghai.</p>
                    <p>I also inclose for your information (1) the minutes of the three first
                        meetings of the subcommittee for considering the improvement of the Whangpu,
                        (2) a note from Sir Robert Hart on the same subject, (3) a pamphlet said to
                        have been written by Mr. Bredan, commissioner of customs at Shanghai, which
                        gives the customs’ views on the conservancy scheme, (4) report on the water
                        approaches to Shanghai, by J. De Rijke, a Danish engineer, and (5) a précis
                        on the efforts heretofore made to have the Whangpu River conserved.<note

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: On the 25th of July we had the
                            honor to receive your excellency’s communication of 19th July, as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“In reply to your letter of 10th of July, in which you propose that the
                            foreign ministers going to audiences with His Majesty the Emperor of
                            China should change their sedan chairs before going through the
                            Ching-yun gate, and leaving there those in which they had reached that
                            point, get into little sedan chairs borne by two hearers who would carry
                            them to the foot of the steps of the Chien-ching gate, I have the honor
                            to inform you that the foreign representatives have declared themselves
                            satisfied with the proposal.”</p>
                        <p>In reply, we would beg to observe that the foreign representatives having
                            agreed to the proposal made by us in our communication of the 10th of
                            July as to the place where they should alight from their chairs on going
                            to audiences, and not insisting on placing us in a difficult position,
                            fully evidence the fact of their friendliness and sympathy. The question
                            of the ceremonial at audiences having now been settled, we will shortly
                            send a special memorial to the Throne stating that it is now closed.</p>
                        <p>The creation of the Wai-wu Pu (Foreign Office) has already been presented
                            to the Throne, and an edict issued which we have communicated to your
                            excellency in another communication. Article 12 of the Joint Note has,
                            therefore, been complied with and need not be a subject of further
                            discussion.</p>
                        <p>In sending this reply, we beg your excellency will be good enough to
                            communicate it to your colleagues.</p>

                        translation of a note addressed to the dean of the diplomatic corps by the
                        Chinese plenipotentiaries on the 27th instant, giving the terms of an
                        Imperial decree creating the Board of Foreign Affairs. The Emperor gives
                        this board precedence in official rank over the heretofore” existing six
                        great ministries (or boards) of state, and appoints a president, two
                        ministers, and chiefs of bureau with the rank of vice presidents of boards
                        to it.</p>

                    <p>The decree is in absolute conformity with the requests of the foreign
                        representatives contained in the note of the dean of the diplomatic corps to
                        the Chinese plenipotentiaries of April 22 last, copy of which was sent you
                        with my No. 131 of July 9.</p>
                    <p>The president of the foreign office is I K’uang, better known as Prince
                        Ch’ing, who has been president of the Tsungli Yamen since 1884.</p>
                    <p>The two ministers, who are to be with him the responsible heads of the
                        office, are: (1) Wang Wen-shao, a native of the province of Che-kiang, a
                        member of the Grand Council of State (or Imperial Cabinet); he has held many
                        high offices of state, having been twice a minister of the Tsungli Yamen and
                        Viceroy of Chih-li; and (2) Ch’ü Hung-chi, a native of Hu-nan, formerly
                        Vice-president of the Board of ceremonies; he has recently been raised to be
                        a member of the Grand Council of State.</p>
                    <p>The two chiefs of bureau have both had experience in the diplomatic service.
                        Hsü Shou-peng was secretary of legation in Washington under Chang Yin-huan,
                        and until recently held the position of minister to Korea. He understands a
                        little English. Lien Fang is an accomplished French scholar. He accompanied
                        Anson Burlingame’s mission abroad, has been secretary of legation in France,
                        and is French secretary of Prince Ching.</p>
                    <p>On the whole, the composition of the new ministry may be considered as quite
                        satisfactory, and makes a new and most important change in our relations
                        with China, giving as it does preeminence to the foreign relations of the
                        Empire over all other branches of its administration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: On the 22dof April we had the
                            honor to receive a communication from your excellency in which you
                            pointed out that by Article XII of the Joint Note the Chinese Government
                            shall undertake to reform the Office of Foreign Affairs.</p>
                        <p>At the time we presented the matter, as communicated by your excellency
                            to us, in a memorial to the Throne, and asked for the issuance of a
                            decree on the subject. We have now received a telegram from Si An,
                            stating that the grand secretariat on the 24th of July received the
                            following decree:</p>
                        <p>“Hitherto the appointment of officials and assigning to them the
                            performance of certain official duties was for the reason that they
                            could do what is suitable as occasion required. As the treaties are now
                            being revised and settled, the first essential is to give due importance
                            to the question of friendly intercourse among nations. To cultivate
                            friendly relations in a sincere and faithful manner we must depend on
                            our subordinates being men of the right caliber.</p>
                        <p>“The Tsungli Yamen was created for the purpose of transacting
                            international affairs. Although it has been in existence for many years,
                            the princes and ministers appointed to the charge of the duties thereof
                            have been intrusted with the discharge of many other duties, and in
                            consequence they have been Unable with their entire energies and
                            faculties to attend properly to the duties of the office. It is right,
                            therefore, that special offices be created in order to assign to each
                            incumbent his proper duty or responsibility. It is hereby ordered that
                            the Tsungli Yamen be changed to Wai-wu Pu, Foreign Office, and it shall
                            take precedence of the six Boards.</p>
                        <p>Prince Ch’ing is hereby appointed President; the Grand Secretary, Wang
                            Wen-shao, is appointed Minister, and the President of the board of
                            works, Chü Hung-chi, is transferred to the Wai-wu Pu as minister, with
                            the title of Shang shu (i. e., President of a board).</p>
                        <p>Hsü Shou-peng, director of the imperial stud, and Lien Fang, an expectant
                            director of a minor court, are hereby appointed chiefs of bureau with
                            rank of senior and junior <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0299"
                            />vice-presidents. As to the other officers, secretaries, etc., their
                            number and rank, the rules of appointment, salaries and grain
                            allowances, let these matters be referred to the Board of Administration
                            and board of civil office to be considered at once and a report thereon
                            presented to us.”</p>
                        <p>As in duty bound, we transmit the above decree changing the Tsungli Yamen
                            to the Wai-wu Pu to your excellency, and will thank you to communicate
                            same for the information of your colleagues.</p>

                            Article IX of the Joint Note accepted by His Majesty the Emperor of
                            China, certain points to be determined by an agreement among the powers
                            are to be occupied by foreign troops in order to maintain free
                            communication between Peking and the sea. I am asked by my colleagues to
                            inform your highness and your excellency that it has been decided, in
                            pursuance of the terms of this article, to occupy the following places
                            on (or adjoining) the Peking-Shan-hai-kuan railway: Huang-ts’un,

                            affecting the railway or the telegraphic communications or the persons
                            and property of soldiers of the allied forces. It will be exercised over
                            the territory along the railway to the extent of 2 miles on either side,
                            and in the case of persons surprised in the act of committing offenses
                            against the railway or the telegraph lines or against the persons or
                            property of soldiers of the allied forces, pursuit can be continued
                            beyond those limits wherever necessary. But with the exception of
                            nersons surprised in flagrante, delicto, the search, pursuit, and arrest

                            foreign military authorities will be exercised by the Chinese

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Highness, Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to
                            acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th of June, concerning
                            which I have been directed by my colleagues to make you the following
                            observations:</p>
                        <p>First. The ministers of Austria-Hungary, of Italy, and of France have
                            already stated to you that the east boundary of the diplomatic quarter
                            was fixed and maintained at Ketteler street (Hata men street), and that
                            the 100 feet to the west of the Hata men gate indicate the extreme limit
                            of our occupation on the wall of the Tartar City, and have nothing in
                            common with the limits on the street. This is what I had the honor to
                            confirm to you in my letter of the 28th of May. It is, therefore, well
                            understood that all the ground situated to the west of Ketteler street
                            and starting from the foot of the wall is comprised in the diplomatic
                            quarter.</p>
                        <p>There has never been any question, as you seem to think, about making a
                            new public road; traffic on that siete is to be limited to Ketteler
                            street. I may add that it is on this condition that the diplomatic corps
                            has consented to relinquish the occupation <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295"
                                facs="0301"/>of the Hata men gate and to withdraw the limit of its
                            occupation on the wall to 100 feet to the west of said gate.</p>
                        <p>Second. The foreign representatives are satisfied with your declarations
                            concerning the western boundary, with the reservation that the public
                            highway is not to be enlarged beyond its present limits, and that the
                            boundary of the quarter is at 40 meters to the west of this public
                            highway and extends northward to the foot of the wall of the Imperial
                            City.</p>
                        <p>His excellency the minister of Russia having consented to give up the two
                            ministries situated to the west of the present limit of the legation
                            quarter, under reserve that a lot should be given to Monsignor Favier,
                            desires to inform you that, as a result of an understanding reached,
                            Monsignor Favier is to obtain the ground to the north of the legation
                            street, starting from the corner of the street Fu Kuei Chieh, in close
                            proximity to the Board of Rites.</p>
                        <p>Third. As to the south limit, I inform you that in my letter of May 28 it
                            was indicated by a line drawn at the foot of the wall along the south
                            side, so that the part of the wall corresponding to the diplomatic
                            quarter is comprised in it; consequently the foreign powers reserve to
                            themselves the right to maintain on its police stations while binding
                            themselves not to construct on it buildings which may change the
                            exterior aspect of the wall.</p>
                        <p>You state in your letter of the 16th of June that on this point you agree
                            with the representatives of the powers; consequently it is well
                            understood that on the summit of the wall, from a point situated 100
                            feet to the west of the Hata men to a point, A, to the east of the Chien
                            men, marked on the plan which you have in your possession, the policing
                            shall be done exclusively by the legation guards, and-that it will only
                            be lawful to build on them the shelters necessary for those guards, in
                            the style of those which existed formerly, so that the exterior aspect
                            of the wall shall not be changed.</p>
                        <p>Fourth. As to the northern limit, in my letter of the 28th of May I
                            informed you that the French minister had approved of your declaration
                            by which this limit shall be at a distance of 80 meters from the Stuart
                            road to the Viale d’Italia (Chang-ngan Chieh), and that these streets
                            shall remain open to horses and wagons. It is to be well understood that
                            traffic shall only be allowed in the present Chang-ngan street On the 80
                            meters to the north and on the 40 meters to the south of this street
                            traffic is prohibited, and no buildings shall be put up thereon.
                            Therefore, as I wrote to you in my above-mentioned letter of the 28th of
                            May, the diplomatic corps cannot authorize the building of police
                            stations on this ground, which is to remain absolutely free from all
                            buildings; but it leaves the Chinese police at liberty to patrol
                            Chang-ngan Chieh street to enforce the police regulations of the
                            diplomatic quarter, of which a copy will be sent you shortly. You will
                            be at liberty to build houses for these police agents outside of the
                            northern boundary of this zone.</p>
                        <p>The above explanations agree with the previous declarations of the
                            ministers of Austria-Hungary, Italy, and of France, as well as with my
                            previous communications on the same subject. They introduce no
                            modifications.</p>
                        <p>As to the last part of your letter, concerning the exterior wall of the
                            Imperial City, the diplomatic corps reserves to itself to write to you
                            ulteriorly on the subject.</p>
                        <p>I avail myself, etc.,</p>

                            the honor to receive your excellency’s communication in regard to the
                            limits of the diplomatic quarter. The views presented by your excellency
                            are in accord with the understanding arrived at with the foreign
                            representatives.</p>
                        <p>In the concluding paragraph, however, having reference to the outer
                            Imperial wall, you state that the foreign representatives will again
                            address us on the subject. We have, in consequence, been waiting for
                            their reply, when we would again address your excellency, terminating
                            this question.</p>
                        <p>We now learn that the British minister, Sir Ernest Satow, has agreed to
                            rebuild the portions of the outer imperial wall which have been opened,
                            and the question may therefore be regarded as settled.</p>
                        <p>In sending this reply to your excellency we beg that you will communicate
                            it for the information of the foreign representatives.</p>

                            premises, and now calls attention to the fact that there are seven
                            cemeteries that have been desecrated and where expiatory monuments are
                            to be erected, at an estimated cost of 10,000 taels each. Ten thousand
                            taels should be paid to the British legation, 50,000 taels to the French
                            legation, and 10,000 taels to the Russian legation. You request, on
                            behalf of foreign representatives, that this money be paid without
                            delay.</p>

                            taels, to be paid the French legation, and one for 10,000 taels, to be
                            paid to the Russian legation, in all 70,000 taels, which we ask your
                            excellency to receive and forward to their respective destinations, and

                        referred to the probability of the powers, in view of their inability to
                        devise a practicable scheme for enforcing the prohibition of the importation
                        of arms and ammunition into China, asking the Chinese Government to take the
                        necessary measures itself to attain the desired end.</p>
                    <p>This step has been finally decided upon, and the inclosed note has been
                        addressed by the dean of the diplomatic corps to the Chinese
                        plenipotentiaries. I am advised that the edict asked for will be promptly
                        issued. It is believed that it is very unlikely that a renewal of the first
                        term of two years will be asked for, the powers being now generally adverse

                            rend="italic">c</hi>, of a clause to the effect that “no conversion,
                        redemption, or cancellation of the bonds shall take place otherwise than by
                        action of sinking fund, which shall be neither increased nor diminished
                        without the consent of the powers.”</p>
                    <p>The British Government also objected to the international committee for the
                        conversion of ad valorem duties into specific, claiming that, the tariff in
                        force at present being the British one, the most-favored-nation clause will
                        protect all interests, and that it could not admit of its tariff being
                        converted by an international board. These are the principal objections.</p>
                    <p>The first clause which Great Britain wishes to have introduced was originally
                        suggested by the Japanese Government, but, in view of the strong opposition
                        which developed against it, the matter was wisely dropped. The clause read,
                        when suggested by Japan: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>No conversion, redemption, or cancellation of the bonds shall take
                                place otherwise than by action of sinking fund, and, as long as any
                                portion of the bonds remains unpaid, China shall not grant to any
                                power any separate or exclusive territorial or financial
                                advantages.</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>As I did not believe that this provision could accomplish the object it had
                        in view, I have never supported it, and have held that it would undoubtedly
                        offend some of the powers, who would categorically refuse to accept it. The
                        Russian minister has since stated that he would not agree to it, and several
                        of the other representatives hold the same views.</p>
                    <p>The refusal of the British Government to agree to the international
                        commission for the conversion of the tariff is wholly inexplicable, for the
                        commission was unanimously accepted by the conference on June 11, when it
                        was proposed by the Japanese minister as a condition for his acceptance of
                        my proposal to convert the import duties into specific ones. The Chinese
                        Government was duly informed on July 27 (see my No. 144, of that date) that
                        this commission was one of the conditions asked for in return for the powers
                        agreeing to a 5 per cent effective import duty.</p>

                            write you on the 30th of July, the representatives of the powers, in
                            consenting to the raising to 5 per cent effective of the present tariff
                            on maritime imports, have decided to ask of China, as a compensation, to
                            participate financially in the improvement of the courses of the Peiho
                            and the Whangpoo.</p>
                        <p>As regards the Peiho, the works for improvement commenced in 1898 have
                            recently been resumed by an international committee in which the Chinese
                            Government will be able to be represented as soon as the administration
                            of. Tientsin shall have been handed over to it. The representatives of
                            the powers have only to request the Chinese Government to pledge itself
                            to pay annually to the said commission a sum of 60,000 Haikwan taels for
                            the maintenance of the works.</p>
                        <p>As regards the Whangpu, a conservancy board, charged with the direction
                            and control of the works, is to be created. This board shall consist of
                            members representing the interests of the Chinese Government and those
                            of the foreigners engaged in the shipping trade of Shanghai. The
                            expenses entailed by the works and the general management of the
                            undertaking are estimated at the sum of 460,000 taels during the first
                            twenty years. This sum shall be supplied in equal portions by the
                            Chinese Government and foreign interests. The detail of the stipulations
                            concerning the composition, duties, and revenues of the board are given

                            present financial condition of the Empire, ask only of China the
                            pecuniary sacrifices indispensable for the general interests in
                            question.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my telegram of the 8th instant and in my
                        dispatch No. 152 of the 9th I referred to the refusal of the British
                        Government to accept the international commission for the conversion of the
                        tariff, which the conference considered had been finally accepted on June 11
                        last.</p>
                    <p>To-day, at a meeting of the diplomatic corps, the Final Protocol was <pb
                            n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0306"/>again discussed and an agreement
                        reached on every part of it, except the above-mentioned provision. The
                        British minister stated that he would not refuse to sign the protocol if it
                        was embodied in it, but in case he did sign he would have to note on the
                        Protocol the reserve of his Government as to this clause.</p>
                    <p>It being held by the conference that such a course was not desirable, and in
                        the hope of closing definitely the final protocol the representatives of the
                        powers, while expressing their disapproval of reopening a question
                        considered settled by a unanimous vote as far back as the 11th of last June,
                        and on condition that no other question should be raised but the Protocol
                        finally accepted, agreed to the British formula, which reads as follows:
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>All duties on imports levied ad valorem shall be converted into
                                specific duties, so far as it is possible to do so, and with the
                                least delay.</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>The paragraph read originally: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>An international commission shall be appointed for that purpose. The
                                powers having a treaty with China and also the Chinese Government
                                can be represented on it by one or more delegates, but they can only
                                have one vote.</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>The chief argument of the British minister against this commission was that
                        it would be unwieldly; as votes would have to be unanimous, it would take a
                        very long time to complete its work, the number of articles on the tariff
                        being over 1,250.</p>
                    <p>It is the intention of the British Government to ask the chief commercial
                        powers in China, Japan, Germany, and the United States to join with it in
                        the work of conversion of the tariff conjointly with the Chinese maritime
                        customs.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>The free list was also agreed upon after a short discussion, and with that
                        the Final Protocol was definitely accepted. A copy of it will be sent at
                        once to the Chinese plenipotentiaries and they will be asked when they can
                        sign it.</p>

                        <p>On receipt of the dispatch and the annexed regulations concerning the
                            conservancy of the Woosung River, which was sent us a few days ago by
                            your excellency, we hastened to submit the question to the examination
                            of the Superintendent for southern trade.</p>
                        <p>We have received to-day from the latter the following telegraphic
                            reply:</p>
                        <p>“I took up these last days, with several foreign consuls, the question of
                            carrying out (this scheme). The British consul told me that his minister
                            had confined himself to telegraphing to him to inform me of it, without
                            having directed him to enter into a discussion on the subject.
                            Consequently I confined myself to asking him to submit my views on the
                            matter, without being able to discuss the question.</p>
                        <p>“This subject being part of an international agreement, it is naturally
                            to you that it belongs to discuss it with the foreign ministers.</p>
                        <p>“As my consent has already been given to the deepening of the river, it
                            is proper that the execution of the work should belong to China, and it
                            is necessary that the sovereign right of China should be recognized. It
                            would be proper that the proposed board should be a Chinese board rather
                            than a foreign one. I beg, therefore, that you will take steps to
                            preserve to us the control, following the lines laid down clearly and in
                            detail in my different telegrams, so that no disagreement shall arise in
                            the future. This is much to be desired for the general interest.</p>
                        <p>“As to junks and Chinese-owned land, the British consul told me orally
                            that there had originally been no intention of taxing them. Some time
                            after the German consul assured me also that no tax would be levied on
                            native boats, and that the land of Chinese would be subject to a very
                            light tax of one-tenth of 1 per cent. Considering the poverty of the
                            common people, it would seem that this tax might be given up, and that
                            if the seven-tenths of the revenue of the tonnage dues should be
                            insufficient—the three other tenths being reserved for the expenses of
                            the ministry of foreign affairs—it would be necessary for the carrying
                            out of these works to use customs receipts. I would also ask of you in
                            this matter to take some decision and to submit a memorial to the
                            Throne. The ministers of America and Japan have telegraphed to me to beg
                            me to give my consent, and I at once consented to the opening of the
                            river. But it is necessary that we should be preserved in our sovereign
                            rights. The board in question should be organized by the customs taotai
                            and the commissioner of customs. The control over the expenses
                            necessitated for the works will be exercised jointly with the delegates
                            of the powers. The agents employed on the works will be engaged jointly
                            by the different powers, but all the other questions are subject to the
                            sovereign authority of the taotai and the commissioner of customs. After
                            the completion of the works the taxes should be abolished, the board
                            dissolved, and the future management should return entirely to the
                            taotai and the commissioner of customs.</p>
                        <p>“The above are the points on which I beg you to negotiate with the
                            ministers and obtain their acceptance.”</p>
                        <p>We, prince and minister, have therefore to state that the Superintendent
                            of southern trade has already given his consent to carrying out the
                            works of deepening the Woosung River, but, as that high official adds,
                            the sovereign rights of China should be recognized. The board should
                            appear as a Chinese board, and be organized by the taotai and the
                            commissioner of customs. The control of the expenses of the undertaking,
                            however, shall be exercised conjointly with the delegates of the powers.
                            It will therefore be necessary, in such articles as the twenty-seventh,
                            thirty-third, and thirty-fourth, which require the agreement of the
                            consulate body, to make mention of the taotai of Shanghai before the
                            consular body. By so doing the rights of sovereignty will remain
                            unimpaired.</p>
                        <p>As regards junks and Chinese-owned land, since the British consul has not
                            expressed the opinion that they should be taxed and the German consul
                            has given assurances that junks would not be taxed, and that it is also
                            possible to give up the idea of levying taxes on Chinese-owned land, we
                            think that the foreign plenipotentiaries will agree with us on this
                            point. We have therefore to ask that paragraphs 1 and 2 of article 30,
                            concerning revenues, shall be stricken out, and that, in case of
                            insufficiency of tonnage dues, we will take upon us to submit to the
                            Throne a report proposing to make up the deficit by means of the 5 per
                            cent effective customs dues.</p>
                        <p>We deem it therefore necessary to address the present official
                            communication to your excellency, and to beg you to submit it as soon as
                            may be to the examination of the foreign plenipotentiaries, so that they
                            may, without any delay, come to a favorable decision upon it, which we
                            beg you will communicate to us.</p>
                        <p>This in consideration of our friendly relations.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Highness, Excellency</hi>: I hastened to transmit to
                            my colleagues your letter dated the 17th of August, in which you
                            informed me of the observations and requests of His Excellency Liu
                            Kun-yi concerning the regulations for the improvement of the course of
                            the Whangpu, and I have the honor to inform you of their reply.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of the powers direct me unanimously to inform you
                            that they consider the question of the regulations for the Whangpu as
                            being finally agreed upon, and that it is consequently impossible for
                            them to reopen the discussion on that subject. They insist that you
                            shall immediately submit this reply to the Throne, so as to obtain from
                            it in the shortest time authorization to sign the final protocol.</p>
                        <p>This point being dismissed, my colleagues wish you to remark that they
                            have never had the intention of infringing upon the sovereign rights of
                            the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, they do not see their way to comply with the request of the
                            Superintendent of southern trade as regards the formation of the board
                            by the taotai and the inspector-general of customs, for this request
                            goes against the steps which they have taken to maintain an equal
                            division between the important interests concerned. It can not be
                            conciliated with the guaranties the powers have been led to ask of
                            China, and which they have chosen after careful study. Furthermore, the
                            presence of the taotai and the commissioner of customs on the board
                            gives to China an important representation, sufficient to safeguard its
                            rights and its interests.</p>
                        <p>As you may convince yourself, the regulations in question only impose
                            taxes on shins of non-Chinese type; that is to say, that native junks
                            are exempt from these duties.</p>
                        <p>The taxes on property situated along the Whangpu do not constitute a
                            heavy burden, especially in view of the appreciation of value the
                            improvement of the course of the river will give to this property. This
                            consideration, which can not escape the superintendent of southern
                            trade, obliges the representatives of the powers to insist on the
                            taxation of real estate along the bank of the Whangpu.</p>
                        <p>The remark of the superintendent of southern trade concerning handing
                            over the completed works to the Chinese Government after a term of
                            twenty years is premature.</p>
                        <p>As regards the telegram of His Excellency Liu Kun-yi referring to the
                            inadequacy of the tonnage dues to cover the portion to be contributed by
                            the Chinese Government, the representatives of the powers have to recall
                            to you that these tonnage dues, being assigned to foreign loans, China
                            will be, under all circumstances, obliged to pay the amount of its
                            contribution for the expenses of the works in question from other
                            sources.</p>
                        <p>Articles 33 and 34 stipulate that the board shall submit for the
                            approbation of the Consular body at Shanghai such increases of taxes as
                            it may have to decide upon, and also its report on the annual accounts.
                            Your highness and your excellency have asked that the approbation of the
                            taotai should be also needed, and that the official should be mentioned
                            before the consuls. My colleagues have the honor to call your attention
                            to the fact that the taotai, being also a member of the board, can not
                            be invested with the power of approving the decisions of this assembly,
                            and that in no case is it possible to place him before the consular body
                            of the powers. But being, nevertheless, desirous to show their spirit of
                            conciliation, and to give your highness and your excellency and also His
                            Excellency Liu Kun-yi proof of high esteem, the representatives of the
                            powers agree to stipulate in articles 33 and 34 that the decisions of
                            the board shall be communicated to the superintendent of southern trade,
                            and to mention this high official before the consular body.</p>
                        <p>Finally, my colleagues insist that I shall call your attention to the
                            fact that the improvement of the course of the Whangpu is one of the
                            conditions made by the powers for their acceptation of the raising of
                            the tariff on maritime imports to an effective 5 per cent; that the
                            above-mentioned regulations form an integral part of the clauses
                            resulting from the note of the 22d of December, 1900, and that it has
                            been approved by all foreign governments. In consequence of this, they
                            put the said condition to the concession mentioned above.</p>

                            Imperial edict for that purpose, we learn by telegram from the grand
                            council at Si-an that the following edict has been promulgated on the
                            12th of the present month (August 25):</p>
                        <p>“The importation of arms is contrary to law. Nevertheless, traders at the
                            ports open to commerce are constantly, under pretext of official
                            purchases, importing and clandestinely selling these arms. Considering
                            that recently peace has been troubled by brigands, and that it is highly
                            important to publish express prohibitions so as to prevent the
                            occurrence of troubles, we command all Tartar generals,
                            governors-general and governors of provinces, as well as customs taotais
                            to prohibit, in the first place for a period of two years, the
                            importation of arms and of materials serving exclusively in their
                            manufacture and coming from abroad.</p>

                        document of the greatest importance, which establishes the normal relations
                        of amity between the foreign nations and the Chinese Empire.</p>
                    <p>“This act is the consequence of extraordinary events which are not pleasant
                        to repeat here. It is the earnest wish of my honorable colleagues and myself
                        that in the lapse of time these events will be more and more enveloped with
                        those of the past. Thanks to the faithful accomplishment of the different
                        clauses of this protocol. It is in this manner that China will demonstrate
                        its sincere intention to cultivate the best international relations, and it
                        is also in this manner that the protocol will produce its fruits of good and
                        cordial amity in the future. Such is the earnest desire of the Governments
                        and their representatives here present who, during the lengthy negotiations
                        which they have pursued with you as Chinese plenipotentiaries, have
                        exercised their best efforts to prove to you their goodwill by making you
                        all possible concessions.</p>
                    <p>“We congratulate ourselves for having contributed to this desirable result,
                        and I have the honor to address to your highness and to your excellency the
                        most sincere wishes which we cherish for the peace and happiness of the

                    <p>M. Morisse translated the discourse of M. de Cologan, to which Prince Ch’ing
                        responded as follows, in Chinese, M. Lien Fang acting as interpreter:</p>

                        foreign powers and the Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>“This document has a most important function to perform; it has to efface the
                        consequences of the criminal and unprecedented events of last year and to
                        preserve our friendly relations.</p>

                        <p>On the 3d day of the 5th moon of the present year (18th of June, 1901),
                            We have received from Your Excellency the following official
                            communication:</p>
                        <p>“Messrs. Jui-liang, secretary, and, Lien-fang, expectant taotai,
                            delegates entrusted with carrying out Article I of the Joint Note
                            providing for the erection of a commemorative monument on the place of
                            the assassination of Baron von Ketteler, former Minister of Germany,
                            commenced some time ago the discussion of the subject with my Legation,
                            and have taken up the question of the plan of this monument.</p>
                        <p>“During frequent conversations they have stated that if it were necessary
                            that a commemorative arch in marble, from Ta-li and extending the whole
                            width of the avenue of Ch’ung-wen-men, should be erected on the spot of
                            the assassination, the work would require a great deal of time, in view
                            of the difficulty in transporting the materials; <pb n="320"
                                xml:id="pg_320" facs="0326"/>but as to adopting some other means,
                            either of transferring to the place of the assassination an archway
                            erected at the present time in some other spot, or of putting up a new
                            arch, or of using an old archway to be transported to the place, they
                            left this to the determination of my Government.</p>
                        <p>“I at once telegraphed my Government to inform me of its views.</p>
                        <p>“The reply which I have just received informs me that His Majesty the
                            Emperor of Germany has himself decided that a new archway extending
                            across the whole width of the street should be put up.</p>
                        <p>“I have consequently to urgently request you to take immediate steps, so
                            that the work may begin at once.”</p>
                        <p>We, Prince and Minister, have at once directed the said secretary and
                            taotai to act in conformity. According to the report which they have
                            sent us, “the work was begun on the 10th day of the 5th moon (25th of
                            June) by the foundations. But a certain length of time is necessary for
                            getting out the stone, cutting it and for the transportation of
                            materials; and the only thing that can be done is to watch that the
                            workmen use their best endeavors to carry on promptly the work.”</p>
                        <p>Besides having directed that We should be kept informed of the execution
                            of the work, We deem it necessary to send the present official reply to
                            Your Excellency, requesting you to take note of it.</p>

                                1901</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Translation</hi>).</p>
                        <p>Since the 5th moon (end of May) the Boxers have created trouble in the
                            capital and have begun hostilities against friendly countries. Yi-K’uang
                            and Li Hung-chang are negotiating for peace at Peking with
                            Representatives of the Powers, and a whole preliminary arrangement has
                            already been signed.</p>
                        <p>(If) We consider the commencement of these events, we find that they are
                            attributable to several stupid Princes and Ministers, insane, absolutely
                            ignorant, turbulent, and who have ignored the laws. They had most
                            absolute confidence in pernicious methods and have led on the Court. Not
                            only did they refuse to obey Our orders to exterminate the Boxers, but
                            they have been so far as to believe in them and, stupidly, they began to
                            attack (the Legations). So it was that this evil fire spread abroad, and
                            circumstances did not permit of its being stopped, several tens of
                            thousands of evil-doers having assembled at the elbow and the armpit
                            (that is to say, at the most important points). Furthermore, the leaders
                            forced generals and ignorant soldiers to attack the Legations, and so it
                            befell that inconceivable evils persisted for several months.</p>
                        <p>The tutelary deities of the Empire have been in danger, the Imperial
                            tombs and the temples of Ancestors have trembled, the country has been
                            devastated; the inhabitants are plunged in misery. No words <pb n="321"
                                xml:id="pg_321" facs="0327"/>can express the dangers which We and H.
                            M. the Empress Dowager have been exposed to. Our heart and Our head are
                            still painful; Our tears and Our resentment are confounded. It is to
                            you, Princes and Ministers, who, by believing in evil words and allowing
                            evil-doers free hand, have put in danger in Heaven our Ancestors and Our
                            gods, and who here below have caused the people to endure these
                            calamities. Do you ask what punishments you deserve?</p>
                        <p>We have already issued two decrees. But, considering that such light
                            punishments for such grievous faults could not be sufficient to make you
                            expiate your crimes, We must impose upon you new and more severe
                            punishments according to your degree of guilt.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tsai-hsün, Prince Chuang</hi>, already degraded,
                            allowed the Boxers to attack the Legations. He, on his own authority,
                            published proclamations contrary to the treaties; he lightly believed
                            the statements of evil-doers; he unlawfully caused to be decapitated a
                            great number of persons; he has shown himself, of a truth, vulgar and
                            stupid. We invite him, as a favor, to commit suicide. We direct
                            Ko-pao-hua, acting president of the Court of Censors, to go and see
                            (that the suicide has taken place).</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tsai-I, Prince Tuan</hi>, already degraded, led away
                            with him several Princes and Peilo (Princes of the 3d class). He
                            foolishly gave heed to the Boxers and stupidly advised fighting. So all
                            these troubles broke out; his faults, of a truth, can not be ignored.
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Tsai-lan, Duke Fu-kuo</hi>, reduced in rank, in
                            concert with <hi rend="smallcaps">Tsai-hsün</hi>, foolishly published
                            proclamations contrary to the treaties. He should also be punished for

                            that they belong to our family, we order, by special act of grace, that
                            they be sent to Hsin-chiang (Ili) where they shall be condemned to
                            prison for life. Deputies shall be at first sent to watch them.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Yü-hsien</hi>, degraded governor, foolishly
                            believed, when formerly discharging the duties of governor in Shantung,
                            in the charms of the Boxers. Arriving in Peking, he extolled them so
                            highly that several Princes and Ministers fell under his evil influence.
                            Being governor of Shansi, he massacred a great number of missionaries
                            and Christians. He is worse than an imbecile, than a fool, than a
                            murderer; he is the chief culprit and the author of all these
                            calamities. He has already been sent to Hsin-chiang, and, believing that
                            he has arrived in Kan-su, We order that, on the receipt of the order
                            which We send, he shall be at once beheaded. We direct the Provincial
                            Judge Ho Fu-kun to see that the penalty is carried out.</p>

                            President of the Board of Works, having lent his aid to the Boxers,
                            serious disturbances broke out. He aided in publishing proclamations
                            contrary to the treaties. A severe punishment was to have been inflicted
                            on him at first, but he has died of disease. We order that the honors
                            which he previously held shall be withdrawn from him and that he be at
                            once degraded.</p>

                            troops under his orders; he was unable to maintain strict discipline.
                            Ignorant, furthermore, of international questions, he followed his ideas
                            and acted in an inconsiderate manner. Although the attacks on the
                            Legations were ordered him by the above degraded Princes, it is
                            nevertheless difficult to absolve him of all faults. We intended in the

                            of extraordinary grace, We order that he shall be immediately

                            force, it is, after all, difficult to absolve him. We order, as a mark
                            of great benevolence, that he be degraded. We condemn him to death, and
                            he shall await in prison that his case be passed on.</p>

                        <p>Edict published and sent telegraphically the 3rd day of the 1st moon (21
                            February, 1901), and received on the 4th by the Grand Chancellery.</p>
                        <p>“By a former Edict We had already severely punished, according to the
                            several cases, all the high officials, the principal authors of the
                            present misfortunes. But We received some time ago a telegraphic report
                            from Yi-K’uang and Li Hung-chang telling Us that, according to an
                            official despatch from the Ministers Plenipotentiary of the various
                            Powers, new and severer punishments were necessary, and begging Us to
                            take action.</p>
                        <p>“Besides <hi rend="smallcaps">Tsai-hsün</hi>, who has been ordered to

                            been pronounced the penalty of immediate decapitation, and for each of
                            whom deputies have been ordered to go see that (the sentences have been
                            carried out), We decide that the penalty to be inflicted on <hi
                                rend="smallcaps">Tsai-yi</hi> (Prince Tuan) and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Tsai-lan</hi> (Duke Lan) is decapitation with reprieve;
                            nevertheless, in view of the relationship in which they stand to Us, We
                            show them the special act of grace of sending them to the frontier of
                            the Empire, in Turkestan, where they shall be imprisoned for life. A
                            deputy to take them under escort shall be designated, and shall leave at
                            once.</p>
                        <p>“As to <hi rend="smallcaps">Kang-yi</hi>, whose crimes were greater, the
                            penalty should have been immediate decapitation, but as he has already
                            died of disease, as an act of grace, he shall be spared further inquiry
                            into his case.</p>

                            decisions, were to have been decapitation with reprieve, We command that
                            they be requested to commit suicide, and We direct Ch’en Ch’un-huan,
                            Governor of Shan-si, to go and verify (their deaths).</p>

                            harm to foreigners, We had previously ordered their degradation; We
                            (now) order Yi-K’uang and Li Hung-chang to ask the Powers, by despatch,
                            for their surrender, and to have them executed at once. One of the
                            Presidents of the Board of Punishments shall be directed to verify
                            (their execution).</p>
                        <p>“As to <hi rend="smallcaps">Hsü Tung</hi>, who compromised the great
                            general interests by putting his confidence in the Boxers, and <hi
                                rend="smallcaps">Li Ping-heng</hi>, whose bragging ways directly

                            theirs was decapitation with reprieve; but taking into consideration the
                            fact that they committed suicide when they saw the disaster coming, and
                            that they have already been degraded, and that the posthumous honors
                            which had been granted them have been annulled and withdrawn, it is
                            needless to take up their cases.</p>
                        <p>“The nature of the crimes committed by all the principal authors of the
                            wrong has been set forth in a clear and detailed way in previous
                            decrees.</p>

                            having spread from day to day, the Court had two difficult methods to
                            adopt—to take coercitive measures or to pacify them. In the hope that a
                            line of conduct would be shown Us the Ministers were several times
                            called in audience.</p>
                        <p>“We have repeatedly questioned <hi rend="smallcaps">Hsü Yung-yi</hi>,
                            President of the Board of War, <hi rend="smallcaps">Li-shan</hi>,

                            possible. Several Ministers, instigators of trouble, availing themselves
                            of this fact, unjustly accused them, handed in memorials in which they
                            denounced them. So it came about that they were severely punished in
                            their persons.</p>
                        <p>“But considering that Hsü Yung-yi and the others showed great zeal for

                            they may have been faithful, and that they had shown themselves
                            industrious, We should grant them a favor.</p>
                        <p>“We command that <hi rend="smallcaps">Li-shan, Hsü Yung-yi, Hsü

                        <p>Official Reply.</p>
                        <p>The 7th day of the 4th moon of the present year (24 May, 1901,) we
                            received from Your Excellency the following official despatch:</p>
                        <p>“I have the honor to acknowledge to Your Highness and Your Excellency
                            receipt of the letter which you were pleased to send me in reply to my
                            communication dated May 7th concerning the indemnities. In the letter to
                            which Your Highness and Your Excellency have just replied we informed
                            you that the approximate figure of the expenses incurred and of the
                            losses sustained by the Powers amounted to the sum of 450 millions of
                            taels, calculated to the 1st of July of the current year.</p>
                        <p>“In reply to this communication Your Highness and Your Excellency have
                            informed me that the Chinese Government proposed to pay off this sum to
                            the powers by monthly payments of 1,250,000 taels during 30 years.</p>
                        <p>“The Representatives of the Powers have not failed to transmit this
                            proposal to their Governments. But they must call the attention of Your
                            Highness and Your Excellency to the fact that the total of the payments
                            proposed by the Chinese Government only represents the capital of the
                            sum mentioned, without the question of interest having been taken
                            account of.</p>
                        <p>“I consequently beg Your Highness and Your Excellency to be so kind as to
                            inform us as soon as possible of the intention of the Chinese Government
                            in this respect.”</p>
                        <p>In considering in a previous despatch the question of indemnities, we
                            explained to Your Excellency the penury of the Chinese treasury.</p>
                        <p>In your last communication Your Excellency is pleased to call our
                            attention to the fact that the annual payments of fifteen millions of
                                <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0333"/>taels which we proposed
                            only represent the capital, and you now call our attention to the
                            question of interest.</p>
                        <p>As we, on our side, had already considered that besides the capital there
                            also had to be taken into consideration the question of annual interest
                            at 4 per cent, we had already, by telegram, submitted to the Throne
                            proposals on this subject, and in reply we have received an Imperial
                            Edict, stating that “the figure of four hundred and fifty millions of
                            indemnities to be paid the Powers, with interest at 4 per cent, is
                            approved,” and we are commanded to take the necessary measures to carry
                            out this decision.</p>
                        <p>We have, therefore, only to comply with the orders of the Throne.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless this obliges us to recall to Your Excellency that the
                            financial resources of China are so restricted that nothing more can be
                            taken from them possibly beyond the fifteen millions of taels which we
                            have already proposed to Your Excellency to devote specially to the
                            payment of indemnities, but as this sum must not only furnish payment of
                            the capital, but also that of interest, we have no other alternative to
                            propose than to prolong the term of payments, which we had in the first
                            place fixed at 30 years, in such a way that the instalments paid during
                            the first period of this term thus extended shall be considered as
                            destined to extinguish the capital, while those made during the second
                            period shall be applied to liquidating the interest account, after which
                            all payments would cease through the extinction of the debt. The
                            Imperial Maritime Customs, already entrusted as we suggested, with the
                            payments of the capital, would likewise be entrusted with the payments
                            on account of interest. As to the amount of the annual interest, it
                            would be understood that it would decrease proportionately every year,
                            according to the progressive reduction of the capital.</p>
                        <p>We have the honor to request Your Excellency to kindly inform us what you
                            think of the plan we suggest above to pay off both capital and interest,
                            or if in your opinion it would not be better to consider a portion of
                            the fifteen millions paid annually as an instalment on the capital to be
                            paid off, and the balance as an instalment on the interest. These
                            details require a careful examination, and demand a previous and full
                            understanding between the parties.</p>
                        <p>China having thus shown its good will in assenting to the demands of the
                            Powers on the question of the indemnity, and in taking all the necessary
                            steps to insure an integral payment of it, we hope to have soon the
                            satisfaction of learning that the Powers are in a position to fix an
                            early date for the evacuation.</p>
                        <p>We have the honor to request Your Excellency to kindly communicate the
                            above to the Representatives of the Powers.</p>

                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">IMPERIAL EDICT of February 1,
                            1901.</hi></p>
                        <p>In all the provinces bandits called for followers and established
                            antiforeign societies. Various edicts were issued formally forbidding
                            this. We repeated this many times, but, nevertheless, in late years
                            there have been in all the Shan-tung districts sects under the name of
                            Ta-tao-huei (Great Knives Society) and I-ho-chuan (Boxers), which spread
                            everywhere, with the object of willful murder and theft. Little by
                            little they reached the Chi-li territory and suddenly entered the
                            capital, where they set fire to the foreign establishments and attacked
                            the Legations. Crimes were also committed against neighboring countries
                            and offenses against the general interest. For not having assured
                            protection we have incurred heavy responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>You people who in ordinary times nourish yourselves and live from the
                            products of this land, and who have all been loaded with the Empire’s
                            favors—you have, however, dared to incite these bandits with the desire
                            to fight, to teach methods for casting spells, and to devote themselves
                            to false practices. You have rashly resisted your officials, whom you
                            have massacred; you have assassinated foreigners, and then you have been
                            the cause of unprecedented calamities, which above all else have plunged
                            your Sovereign and your fathers in grief.</p>
                        <p>We can not think of what has been done without feeling a still deeper
                            resentment. We have already formally ordered the Commanders in chief of
                            all the regions to use their most strenuous efforts to destroy these
                            societies. It is incumbent that the root of the evil be suppressed, and
                            the Princes and Ministers who have lent their support to the Boxers
                            shall suffer the heaviest penalties according to their crimes, and in
                                <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0338"/>order to inspire fear, all
                            civil and military examinations shall be suspended during five years in
                            all cities where foreigners were massacred or suffered cruel
                            treatment.</p>
                        <p>Fearing lest the ignorant rural populations may not hear (of these
                            punishments), new and severe prohibitions shall be specially made in
                            order to avoid the execution of people who have not been notified.</p>
                        <p>You, soldiers and people, should know that it is formally forbidden by
                            law to organize or belong to secret societies. Our ancestors have never
                            shown the slightest indulgence in the repression of societies of
                            malefactors.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the foreign Powers are all friendly countries, the Christians
                            are children of our blood whom the Court regards with a same kindness,
                            and It could not allow different sentiments to be displayed towards
                            them. All Chinese, whether Christians or not, who may be illtreated,
                            should complain to the authorities and wait until a fair and equitable
                            judgment is rendered. How can you lightly believe all the rumors which
                            have been spread? How can you disregard the penal laws?</p>
                        <p>Then, when all is lost, the clever ones save themselves by flight and the
                            innocent are put to death. The law is slow to pardon, and all that has
                            happened is really very regrettable. From the publication of this
                            present edict, each one must reform and repent him of the teaching he
                            has received.</p>
                        <p>If hardened and incorrigible malefactors should again secretly organize
                            antiforeign societies, they shall be punished by death, as well as those
                            belonging to these societies. They shall not be shown the slightest
                            mercy.</p>
                        <p>The Tartar Generals, Governors-general, Governors, and High provincial
                            Authorities whose duty it is to direct the population, should give
                            explicit instructions to their subordinates to publish severe
                            proclamations and to have the present edict printed on yellow paper,
                            which shall be posted in all parts of the Empire. It is important that
                            all families be notified, and urged to good conduct, and that all be
                            informed that the will of the Court is that everyone should thoroughly
                            understand that punishments will be meted out, in order to avoid the
                            necessity of inflicting other punishments.</p>
                        <p>Let this edict be made known to all in the Empire.</p>
                        <p>Respect this!</p>

                                (<hi rend="italic">Translation</hi>).</p>
                        <p>It has been stipulated in the treaties concluded between China and the
                            Foreign Powers that the citizens of these Powers shall be allowed to
                            penetrate into the interior.</p>
                        <p>The Court, in order to assure and maintain relations with other
                            countries, has already published decrees ordering that most sincere
                            efforts be made in the provinces to assure protection. Nevertheless, <pb
                                n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0339"/>the local authorities having
                            gradually grown lax (in the exercise of their duties), malefactors have
                            caused trouble, and attacks have been directed against foreigners.
                            Similar incidents have repeatedly occurred.</p>
                        <p>We realize that our ability was too limited to reform the ignorant
                            people, and consequently we have made very grievous mistakes. In
                            ordinary times, not one of the local officials has been able to make
                            understood European affairs, and none have comprehended the importance
                            of foreign relations. Consequently the conflagration spread everywhere,
                            threatening the Empire, and, if they reflect, they will find they have
                            cause for uneasiness.</p>
                        <p>Henceforth each one of you must strive to overcome his resentment and to
                            lay aside his prejudices. You should know that the maintenance of
                            friendly relations with foreign countries has in all times been a
                            fundamental law. People coming to China from afar, whether as merchants
                            to exchange their products, or as travelers to increase their scientific
                            knowledge, or yet as missionaries to preach religion with the object of
                            exhorting the people to do good, have crossed mountains and seas at the
                            risk of great fatigue.</p>
                        <p>Since China passes for a civilized country, it should practice the duties
                            of a host toward its guests. Moreover, the Chinese who have gone abroad
                            in recent years number at least several hundreds of thousands. The
                            safety of their persons and property depends upon the guaranty assured
                            them by the Powers, who have given them their protection. How could we
                            continue to treat their citizens differently?</p>
                        <p>We again command all the responsible High civil and military Authorities
                            of all the provinces to order their subordinates to protect, in the most
                            efficacious manner, the agents and nationals of the foreign Powers who
                            may enter within their districts. In case daring malefactors should urge
                            to illtreat and massacre foreigners, order must be restored immediately
                            and the guilty parties arrested and punished without delay. No delay
                            should occur. If, owing to indifference, or rather of voluntary
                            tolerance, great calamities take place, or if treaties should be
                            violated and no immediate steps taken to make reparation or inflict
                            punishment, the Governors-general, Governors, and the provincial or ocal
                            Officials responsible will be removed and shall not be reappointed to
                            other offices in other provinces, or hope to be reinstated or receive
                            any further honors.</p>
                        <p>The present decree must be printed and published to warn the officials
                            and put an end to all shameful customs.</p>

                        <p>The 9th day of the 6th moon the Grand Chancellery received the following
                            Edict:</p>
                        <p>“The creation of offices and the determination of their duties has until
                            now been regulated by the requirements of the times. Now, at the present
                            time, when a new treaty of peace is concluded, international affairs
                            take the first place among important business, and it is more than ever
                            necessary to have recourse to competent men to devote themselves to all
                            that relates to establishing friendly relations and confidence in
                            speech.</p>
                        <p>“The Office of Foreign Affairs, formerly created to treat international
                            questions, has been in existence, it is true, for years, but, in view of
                            the Princes and Ministers composing it only discharging for the most
                            part their functions accessorily with others, they could not devote
                            themselves to them exclusively. It is naturally, therefore, <pb n="338"

                        <p>1°. Solemn audiences to be given by His Majesty the Emperor of China to
                            the Diplomatic Body or to Representatives of the Powers separately shall
                            take place in the palace hall called “Ch’ien-ch’ing Kung.”</p>
                        <p>2°. In going to or coming back from these solemn audiences the
                            Representatives of the Powers shall be carried in their sedan chairs as
                            far as outside of the Ching-yun gate. At the Ching-yun gate they will
                            get out of the sedan chair in which they have come and will be carried
                            in a little chair (i chiao) as far as the foot of the steps of the
                            Ch’ien-ch’ing gate.</p>
                        <p>On arriving at the Ch’ien-ch’ing gate the Representatives of the Powers
                            shall get out of their chairs, and shall proceed on foot into the
                            presence of His Majesty in the Ch’ien-ch’ing Kung hall.</p>
                        <p>When departing the Representatives of the Powers shall return to their
                            residences in the same manner as that in which they arrived.</p>
                        <p>3°. When a Representative of a Power shall have occasion to present to
                            His Majesty the Emperor his letters of credence or a communication from
                            the Head of the State by whom he is accredited, the Emperor shall cause
                            to be sent to the residence of said Representative, to bear him to the
                            Palace, a sedan chair with yellow trimmings and tassels, such as are
                            used by the Princes of the Imperial family. The said Representative
                            shall be taken back to his residence in the same manner. An escort of
                            troops shall likewise be sent to the residence of said Representative to
                            accompany him going and returning.</p>
                        <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0345"/>
                        <p>4°. When presenting his letters of credence or communication from the
                            Head of the State by whom he is accredited, the Diplomatic Agent, while
                            bearing said letters or communications, shall pass by the central
                            openings of the Palace doors until he has arrived in the presence of His
                            Majesty. On returning from these audiences he will comply, as regards
                            the doors by which he may have to pass, with the usages already
                            established at the Court of Peking for audiences given to Foreign
                            Representatives.</p>
                        <p>5°. The Emperor shall receive directly into his hands the letters and
                            communications above mentioned which the Foreign Representatives may
                            have to hand to him.</p>
                        <p>6°. If His Majesty should decide upon inviting to a banquet the
                            Representatives of the Powers it is well understood that this banquet
                            shall be given in one of the halls of the Imperial Palace and that His
                            Majesty shall be present in person.</p>
                        <p>7°. In brief, the ceremonial adopted by China as regards Foreign
                            Representatives shall, in no case, be different from that which results
                            from perfect equality between the Countries concerned and China, and
                            without any loss of prestige on one side or the other.</p>

                    <p>Part 2. On September 17 the Russian chargé delivered a memorandum inquiring,
                        first, whether the United States intends to transfer its legation from Pekin
                        to Tientsin; second, if full powers of Prince Ching and Li Hung Chang are
                        recognized by the United States as sufficient; third, if the United States
                        is prepared to charge its representatives to enter forthwith upon
                        preliminary negotiations with the plenipotentiary of the Chinese

                        against international law recently perpetrated in China.</p>
                    <p>To this the following note has been handed the German chargé today: <quote

                                the Government of the United States as regards the exemplary

                                    facs="0348"/>in the crimes committed in Pekin against
                                international law, I have the honor to make the following
                                statement:</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States has from the outset proclaimed
                                its purpose to hold to the uttermost the responsible authors of any
                                wrongs done in China to citizens of the United States and their
                                interests, as was stated in the Government circular to the powers of
                                July 3 last. These wrongs have been committed not alone in Pekin,
                                but in many parts of the Empire, and their punishment is believed to
                                be an essential element of any effective settlement which shall
                                prevent a recurrence of such outrages and bring about permanent
                                safety and peace in China. It is thought, however, that no punitive
                                results can be so effective by way of reparation for wrongs suffered
                                and as examples for the future as the degradation and punishment of
                                the responsible authors by the supreme Imperial authority itself,
                                and it seems only just to China that she should be afforded in the
                                first instance the opportunity to do this, and thus rehabilitate
                                herself before the world. Believing thus, and without abating in any
                                wise its deliberate purpose to exact the fullest accountability from
                                the responsible authors of the wrongs we have suffered in China, the
                                Government of the United States is not disposed as a preliminary
                                condition to entering into diplomatic negotiations with the Chinese
                                Government to join in demand that said Government surrender to the
                                powers such persons as to the determination of the powers themselves
                                may be held to be first and perpetrators of these wrongs. On the
                                other hand, this Government is disposed to hold that the punishment
                                of the high responsible authors of these wrongs, not only in Pekin
                                but throughout China, is essentially a condition to be embraced and
                                provided for in the negotiations for a final settlement. It is
                                proposed by this Government at the earliest practicable moment to
                                name its plenipotentiaries for negotiating a settlement with China,
                                and in the meantime to authorize its minister in Pekin to enter into
                                conference with the representatives of the Chinese Government with a
                                view to bring about a preliminary agreement whereby full exercise of
                                the Imperial authority for the preservation of order and the
                                protection of foreign life and property throughout north China
                                pending final negotiations with the Chinese shall be assured.</p>

                    <p>In his preliminary communications with Earl Li and Prince Ching Mr. Conger
                        will obtain valuable guidance as to the purposes of this Government by
                        referring to the circular telegram of July 3, in which the general
                        intentions of this Government are fully represented.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Conger is directed to constantly bear in mind the principle laid down in
                        the memorandum of September 7, and to withhold recognition from all persons
                        proposed as negotiators not acceptable under its terms or not possessed of

                        these punishments are carried out is to be given to the powers.</p>

                    <p>(Mr. Conger reports that the following has been submitted by Prince Ching and
                        Earl Li as a general preliminary treaty, together with request for a meeting
                        with the foreign minisiters:) <list>
                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Article</hi> 1. Laying siege to legations of
                                foreign ministers is a high offense against one of the important
                                principles of international law. No country can possibly tolerate
                                such a thing. China acknowledges her great fault in this respect and
                                promises that it will never occur again.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 2. China admits her liability to
                                pay indemnity for the various losses sustained on this occasion, and
                                the powers will each appoint officials to examine and present all
                                claims for final consultation and settlement.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 3. As to future trade and general
                                international relations, each power should designate how these
                                matters should be dealt with, whether the old treaties shall
                                continue or new conventions be made slightly adding to the old
                                treaties, or canceling old treaties and negotiating new ones. Any of
                                these plans may be adopted, and when China has approved, further
                                special regulations can be made in each case as required.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 4. This convention will be made by
                                China with the combined powers to cover general principles which
                                apply alike to all. This settled, the foreign ministers will remove
                                the seals they caused to be placed in the various parts of the
                                tsungli yamen, and ther the yamen ministers may go to the yamen and
                                attend to business as usual. And further, each power should arrange
                                its own special affairs with China, so that separate treaties may be
                                settled in due order. When the various items of indemnity are all
                                arranged properly, or an understanding has been come to about them,
                                then the powers will successively withdraw their troops.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 5. The troops sent to China by the
                                powers were for the protection of the ministers, and for no other
                                purpose, so when negotiations begin for treaties of peace each power
                                should first declare an armistice.</item>

                        before replying. He states that the general negotiations should cover as

                        a defensible legation settlement, and legation and railroad guards; (6) the
                        substitution of a minister for foreign affairs instead of tsungli yamen; (7)

                    <p>(Mr. Hay acknowledges Mr. Conger’s telegram of the 16th instant and states
                        that the Chinese propositions are, in the main, acceptable to us, with the
                        incorporation of his suggestions and of points hereinafter expressed. If Mr.
                        Conger’s seventh suggestion means placing Peking on the footing of a treaty
                        port it is commendable.</p>
                    <p>The French proposition of terms, which was communicated to Mr. Hay on the 4th
                        instant and replied to on the 10th, is probably now in Mr. Conger’s
                        possession. We accept the first article, taking the Chinese punishment edict
                        as a starting point; additional names to be suggested by representatives of
                        the powers when negotiations are begun.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>Second. It is not understood that interdiction of importation of arms
                            is to be permanent; its duration and regulation proper subject of
                            discussion.</item>
                        <item>Third. All the powers desire equitable indemnity, intention of
                            acquisition of territory being positively disclaimed by all. We would
                            favor Russian suggestion to remit the question to The Hague arbitration
                            court in case of a protracted disagreement as to amount of
                            indemnity.</item>
                        <item>Fourth. While now maintaining precautionary legation guards, the
                            United States is unable to make permanent engagement without legislative
                            authorization.</item>
                        <item>Fifth. As to dismantling Taku forts, the President reserves opinion
                            pending further information in regard to the situation in China.</item>
                        <item>Sixth. We can not commit ourselves to participation in military
                            occupation of the road from Tientsin. It would require legislation, but
                            it is desirable that assurance be obtained from China by the powers of
                            the right to guard legations and to have unrestricted access when
                            required.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>We are advised that the French proposition has been acquiesced in by all the
                        powers, with more or less reservations, which, like ours, are not calculated
                        to embarrass negotiations. French note received the 17th instant urges that
                        the powers agree to show to China their readiness to negotiate by
                        communicating, without prejudice to discussion of the points reserved as
                        above, the French propositions, either severally or through the dean of the
                        diplomatic corps. Mr. Conger will <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0352"
                        />confer with his colleagues with a view to doing this. We are anxious to
                        have the negotiations begin as soon as we and the other powers are satisfied
                        of the Emperor’s ability and power to deal justly and sternly with the
                        responsible offenders, and the President so replied to an appeal of the
                        Emperor communicated by telegraph.</p>
                    <p>During the negotiations no opportunity to safeguard the principle of
                        impartial trade, to which all the powers are pledged, should be lost. * *

                        Chinese Government be asked the punishment it proposed to inflict. The
                        leading foreign ministers have so far, in addition to the punishment of the
                        leaders, unanimously agreed to the following: <list>

                            <item>Second. The suppression for two years of civil and military
                                examinations in criminal districts and the decreeing of death
                                punishment for future members of Boxer organization.</item>
                            <item>Third. Indemnities for governments, societies, individual
                                foreigner and Chinese employed by foreigners.</item>
                            <item>Fourth. Legations shall have the right to put legation quarters in
                                a state of defense and to establish permanent guards, and to occupy
                                certain points to assure free communication between the capital and
                                the sea.</item>
                            <item>Fifth. The destruction of Taku and other forts which might
                                interfere with such communication.</item>
                            <item>Sixth. The substitution for the Tsungli Yamen of minister for

                                on Government loans as may be indicated by the foreign

                    <p>(Mr. Hay, replying to Mr. Conger’s telegram of the 1st instant, states that
                        the seven proposed conditions are approved by the President, who thinks
                        dismantling Taku forts would be preferable to their destruction, and
                        suggests consultation on this point with military commander.</p>
                    <p>Replying to Mr. Conger’s telegram of the 6th instant, Mr. Hay states that the
                        first and second conditions, especially the second, appear to be practical
                        safeguards for the future. If the powers can not agree on the first
                        condition, this Government would reserve the right to negotiate in that
                        sense with China, independently but coin-cidentally with the powers
                        entertaining the same view. The third condition would appear to devolve
                        responsibility too completely on the local authorities. The President is of
                        the opinion that the primary responsibility of the Chinese Government should
                        be emphasized, the suggested accountability and provisions for punishment of
                        delinquent local authorities being merely one phase of the enforcement of
                        the supreme obligation to repress, punish, and make adequate reparation for
                        treaty infractions. The President regards as of greatest importance prompt
                        agreement upon bases of settlement, and would regret if divergence upon
                        essential points should necessitate separate convention with powers agreeing
                        upon such points, as is intimated by Mr. Conger.</p>
                    <p>The moral effect of unanimous concert can hardly be overestimated.)</p>

                        possible, that Peking may be made as treaty port and that the Chinese

                    <p>(Mr. Hay states that the President is most solicitous that the present
                        negotiations shall not fail, either through the presentation ol demands with
                        which it may be impossible for China to comply, or by reason of a lack of
                        harmonious cooperation among the powers. The President, confiding in Mr.
                        Conger’s experience and wisdom, has left him large discretion as to details,
                        and prefers still to follow that course. The President desires Mr. Conger,
                        however, to consult with his colleagues and to seriously consider whether
                        the presentation of a list of high Chinese officials and the demand for
                        their capital punishment, as an ultimatum, may not result in a failure of
                        negotiations through confession by China of inability to carry out the death
                        sentences. The United States Government, in common with the other powers,
                        desires and must exact the severe and exemplary punishment of cnose high
                        officials whose crimes have shocked the civilized world, but the President
                        thinks it would be most unfortunate if the powers, having presented an
                        ultimatum to which China may possibly not be able to give effect, should be
                        compelled either to withdraw their demands or to enforce them by a course of
                        action which all deprecate and which would entail consequences impossible to
                        foresee.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hay further states that similar considerations apply to the question as
                        to the amount of indemnity to be demanded. The President favors the exaction
                        of a lump sum not beyond the limit of China to pay, to be hereafter
                        equitably distributed among the interested powers. He directs Mr. Hay to
                        repeat to Mr. Conger the instructions heretofore frequently given, that, in
                        view of the serious complications which may result from long delay, Mr.
                        Conger use every endeavor to bring the negotiations to a speedy and
                        satisfactory close.)</p>

                    <p>(Mr. Conger refers to his telegram of the 6th November, and states that the
                        Russian minister is still opposed to the second proposition, and that the

                    <p>(Mr. Hay answers Mr. Conger’s telegram of the 21st, stating that the United
                        States Government favors the second proposition in Mr. Conger’s telegram of
                        the 6th, but does not wish to embarrass the general negotiations by
                        insisting upon it. He states that if Mr. Conger means by the suggestion in
                        the last paragraph of his telegram of the 6th the contingency of separate
                        conventions between China and the powers agreeing to the three conditions,
                        this Government thinks for China to suppose such separate treaties possible
                        might seriously obstruct the general convention upon points concerning which
                        all the powers are agreed. He adds that a general convention is of the first
                        importance, and that when concluded each power has, of course, liberty to
                        negotiate upon any points not therein expressed.)</p>

                        received fuller reports of the conferences from the Japanese minister. The
                        President disapproves the word “irrevocable,” as apparently equivalent to
                        the ultimatum to which he understands all the powers are opposed. The
                        President gravely questions whether it will be possible to have the death
                        sentences executed in all cases. He also doubts the advisability of the

                        <p>During the months of May, June, July, and August of the present year
                            serious disturbances broke out in the northern provinces of China, and
                            crimes unprecedented in human history—crimes against the law of nations,
                            against the laws of humanity, and against civilization—were committed
                            under peculiarly odious circumstances. The principal of these crimes
                            were the following: <list>
                                <item>First. On the 20th June, His Excellency Baron von Ketteler,
                                    German minister, pioceeding to the Tsungli yamen, was murdered
                                    while in the exercise of his official duties by soldiers of the
                                    regular army acting under orders of their chiefs.</item>
                                <item>Second. The same day the foreign legations were attacked and
                                    besieged; these attacks continued without intermission until the
                                    14th August, on which date the arrival of foreign troops put an
                                    end to them. These attacks were made by regular troops who
                                    joined the Boxers and who obeyed orders of the court emanating
                                    from the Imperial palace. At the same time the Chinese
                                    Government officially declared by its representatives abroad
                                    that it guaranteed the security of the legations.</item>
                                <item>Third. The 11th June Mr. Sugiyama, chancellor of the legation
                                    of Japan, in the discharge of an official mission, was killed by
                                    regulars at the gates of the city. At Peking and in several
                                    provinces foreigners were murdered, tortured, or attacked by
                                    Boxers and regular troops, and only owed their safety to their
                                    determined resistance. Their establishments were pillaged and
                                    destroyed.</item>
                                <item>Fourth. Foreign cemeteries, at Peking especially, were
                                    desecrated, the graves opened, the remains scattered abroad.
                                    These events led the foreign powers to send their troops to
                                    China in order to protect the lives of their representatives and
                                    their nationals and to restore order. During their march to
                                    Peking the allied forces met with the resistance of the Chinese
                                    armies and had to overcome it by force. China having recognized
                                    her responsibility, expressed her regrets, and manifested the
                                    desire to see an end put to the situation created by the
                                    disturbances referred to, the powers have decided to accede to

                    <p>(Mr. Conger reports that at the last moment, when the British minister
                        believed himself authorized to sign the note and had agreed to it, but
                        awaited formal authorization, his Government objects to the word
                        “irrevocable” as committing the powers to possible ulterior operations, the
                        scope of which is not defined, and Great Britain proposes to add at the end
                        of the conditions the words: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p rend="flushleft">Until the Chinese Government has complied with the

                                can hold out no expectation that the occupation of Peking and the
                                province of Chihli by the several forces can be brought to a
                                conclusion.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Conger thinks the above words, instead of limiting the scope of ulterior
                        operations, these words appear to commit the powers still more extensively.
                        He adds that the Germanand Russian ministers agree to the addition, that
                        others will probably do so, and asks if he shall accept.)</p>

                    <p>(Acknowledging Mr. Conger’s telegram of the 16th, Mr. Hay refers to the text
                        of the note telegraphed on December 4 as having been agreed upon, which
                        omitted “irrevocable,” and states that Mr. Conger was telegraphed on the 5th
                        to “Sign joint note as transmitted.” Mr. Hay does not understand how
                        “irrevocable”comes to be restored without the Department’s knowledge. The
                        United States Government objects to it, and has done so from the
                        beginning.</p>
                    <p>The additional amendment proposed by Great Britain is also objectionable,
                        since the United States can not engage to participate in an indefinite
                        occupation of Peking and Chihli by the general forces. This objection is
                        individual on the part of the United States Government. Mr. Conger is
                        instructed that if he finds general concurrence in the British amendment, he
                        need not stand out against it, but in yielding he should make it clear that
                        it does not bind the United States to continue conjoint military operations.
                        But the Department thinks earnest endeavor should be made for acquiescence
                        in the agreed draft telegraphed December 4.)</p>

                    <p>(Mr. Conger replies to Mr. Hay’s telegram of the 17th, and states that in his
                        telegram of the 4th he said: “The majority of them prefer to retain the word
                        ‘irrevocable,’ and that the Department’s answer, as received, reads: ‘Sign
                        joint note as <hi rend="italic">majorities.</hi>’” He accordingly informed
                        his colleagues, who were gratified at concession to their views. As all have
                        notified their governments that “irrevocable” was to be retained, he doubts
                        whether they will again agree to omit it. He thinks “irrevocable” not so
                        objectionable since the death penalty is omitted. Says he will, however,
                        insist on its omission, but asks if he shall yield should final agreement
                        depend upon his so doing.)</p>

                    <p>(Mr. Conger acknowledges the receipt of the Department’s instructions of
                        December 19, just as the ministers were about to sign the joint note. Found
                        it impossible to secure the omission of the word “irrevocable “that day, and
                        reports that it can only be done, if at all, by opening the whole question
                        for other and objectionable changes. He is confident it will be very
                        prejudicial to the negotiations if he is not permitted to sign now, and
                        thinks it will never be possible to secure unanimity on another note with so
                        few objections as this one has. He awaits the Department’s definite
                        instructions.)</p>

                        comprise them in settlement: <list>
                            <item>First. Increased intercourse with Chinese Empire under conditions
                                no less beneficial to China than to foreign nations, to the end that
                                peace and order may be perpetuated by building up the prosperity of
                                China.</item>
                            <item>Second. A lump indemnity, to be kept within as moderate limits as
                                possible, in order to assure China’s ability to pay. This point
                                should receive Mr. Conger’s most earnest attention. In the
                                distribution of the indemnity the United States to have just pro
                                rata share based on losses and magnitude of interests.</item>
                            <item>Third. Reorganization of the Chinese foreign office on modern
                                lines. It would be highly desirable to have a minister of foreign
                                affairs who shall speak one European language at least; and who
                                should be in a position to receive his orders from the
                                Emperor.</item>
                            <item>Fourth. Peking to be on the footing of a treaty port with
                                international concessions, of which legation compound capable of
                                defense shall form part.)</item>

                        Chih-tung, has, by decree, ordered plenipotentiaries not to formally sign
                        the protocol embodying our demands and the decree accepting them. This is
                        evidently done in the hope of securing better terms. Mr. Conger considers
                        the demands as having been already accepted by a former decree transmitted
                        to the ministers by the Chinese plenipotentiaries and shall so insist on it.
                        Protest against the last decree has been telegraphed by Prince Ching and
                        Earl Li.)</p>

                        as reasonable as possible. According to the best information obtainable here
                        the Chinese Government can not possibly pay more than $150,000,000. This
                        will probably necessitate a certain scaling down of the demands of the
                        different powers. Third, Mr. Conger will insist, when the lump sum is agreed
                        upon and granted, that a fair proportionate share of it be allotted to the
                        United States, its equitable distribution to the claimants to be undertaken
                        by the United States Government. Fourth, be will propose, in case of
                        protracted disagreement over the indemnity, that the matter be submitted to
                        arbitration, as provided by The Hague rules.</p>

                    <p>(Mr. Conger reports that a conference was held on the 5th instant by the
                        foreign ministers with the Chinese plenipotentiaries, who presented the
                        difficulties in the way of executing Prince Tuan, Duke Lan, and Tung
                        Fu-hsiang. They promise death of Chuang and Yü Hsien, but urge leniency for
                        the others, and beg that they and the court be not placed in too difficult a
                        position. Subsequently the foreign ministers agreed to demand capital
                        sentence, to be immediately commuted to exile, for Tuan and Lan, and death
                        penalty for the others mentioned in the decree, adding Yü Hsien, Chi Hsiu,
                        and Hsü Cheng-yu, the two latter being now prisoners of the Japanese in
                        Peking. Posthumous honors for the members of the Tsungli Yamen, executed
                        last summer, are also to be demanded.)</p>

                        the right to make up separate demand? Third: Will the killing and wounding,
                        during the siege, of the legation guards be treated differently from the

                    <p>(Mr. Hay states that it seems to this Government that the presentation to
                        China of itemized bills by each of the powers, to be paid to <pb n="362"
                            xml:id="pg_362" facs="0368"/>them separately, is wholly impracticable.
                        Should the approximate estimates of the powers amount to a total beyond the
                        ability of China to pay, the sum should be cut down to a reasonable figure,
                        but should always be treated in the negotiations as a lump sum. Mr. Conger
                        is instructed to endeavor to make it as moderate as possible; but when the
                        amount is agreed upon he will insist upon an equitable portion for the
                        United States. Should an agreement for distribution seem impracticable at
                        Peking without great delay, he is to suggest Hague arbitration.</p>
                    <p>Second. The legation guards killed or wounded, during the siege should be on
                        the same footing as civilians killed or wounded for whom indemnity is
                        claimed. This point will be taken care of by each power in distributing its
                        share of the lump indemnity.)</p>

                        the Chinese and their cities, the question of punishment should be regarded

                        the circumstances which induce the ministers to insist upon further

                        in an attitude of opposition to his colleagues, instructs him to make clear
                        to them the President’s earnest desire for peace, the cessation of
                        bloodshed, and the resumption of normal relations.)</p>

                    <p>The following memorandum, which was handed to the Chinese minister on
                        February 19, is transmitted to you for your information and guidance. It has
                        been communicated to the Governments of the powers that preservation of the
                        territorial integrity of China having been recognized by all the powers now
                        engaged in joint negotiations concerning the injuries recently inflicted
                        upon their ministers and nationals by certain officials of the Chinese
                        Empire, it is evidently advantageous to China to continue the present
                        international understanding upon this subject. It would therefore be unwise
                        and dangerous in the extreme for China to make any arrangement or to
                        consider any proposition of a private nature involving the surrender of
                        territory or financial obligations by convention with any particular power,
                        and the Government of the United States, aiming solely at the preservation
                        of China from the danger indicated and the conservation of the largest and
                        most beneficial relations between the Empire and other countries, in
                        accordance with the principle set forth in its circular <pb n="364"
                            xml:id="pg_364" facs="0370"/>note of July 3, 1900, and in a purely
                        friendly spirit toward the Chinese Empire and all the powers now interested
                        in the negotiations, desires to impress its sense of the impropriety,
                        inexpediency, and even extreme danger to the interests of China of
                        considering any private, territorial or financial arrangement, at least
                        without the full knowledge and approval of all the powers now engaged in
                        negotiations.</p>

                    <p>(Mr. Rockhill reports that rules for estimating all private claims for losses
                        were adopted on the 14th instant by the diplomatic corps, subject to
                        approval by their Governments. The principal points are as follows: <list>
                            <item>First. Only those claims which result immediately and directly
                                from the antiforeign movement of 1900 are allowable.</item>
                            <item>Second. Proof of loss must be made to the satisfaction of
                                claimants’ diplomatic representative and proved conformably to the
                                laws and usages of his country.</item>
                            <item>Third. After examining claims made by his nationals, each of the
                                diplomatic representatives shall make an approximate estimate of the
                                total, and the grand total will be asked in a lump sum of China,
                                without any details or explanations. Nothing unusual except allowing
                                claims for objects lost or disappeared during the troubles, which
                                covers <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0371"/>looting of
                                foreigners by foreigners. Interest at 5 per centum on personal
                                claims and 7 per centum on commercial ones is allowable from date of
                                loss when asked on productive property. So far as he knows there is
                                no rule to the prejudice of just American claims. All speculative
                                claims are excluded; those for breach of existing contracts are
                                allowed. Thinks rules, copy of which is forwarded by mail, should at
                                once be approved by the United States. The Russian minister reserves
                                the right to present his claim separately, unless otherwise
                                instructed. With the exception of the Russian minister, the foreign
                                representatives are in favor of putting war and other indemnities to
                                States, including those for legation guards killed and wounded, into
                                the general lump sum demanded. Final agreement on the general
                                subject of the presentation of indemnity is reserved for future
                                consideration. At the proper moment he will urge the views expressed
                                in the Department’s telegrams of November 16 and 20, and subsequent
                                ones, which Mr. Conger made known to the diplomatic corps on
                                February 16. France, Russia, and most of the other powers agree in
                                the principle that China is to be credited with treasure, etc.,
                                seized by troops during operations.)</item>

                    <p>(Mr. Hay states that the essential object of the revision of consular
                        treaties is to favor Chinese financial stability and promote ability to ouy
                        in any market and to exchange native products, wherever produced, on equal
                        terms with all nations. Inequalities of likin should be removed, and fixed
                        rates for all of China could be scheduled according to importance and value
                        of imports—some higher than now, and others lower, as they can safely stand.
                        Trade with the interior is made speculative and uncertain by the present
                        irregular likin. Customs duties should be scheduled anew. Besides
                        discriminating against cheaper necessaries, the present uniform rate yields
                        inadequate revenue. Five to 15 per cent, according to the character of
                        goods, would equalize trade without partiality or burden, and, as trade
                        penetrates interior, would yield steadily increasing revenue. Application to
                        the whole of China of the open door is required to do this. Equal
                        opportunity should be had by all trading nations to sell throughout the
                        Empire. Lower duties should be attached to imports tending to develop
                        Chinese productiveness. Agricultural implements and simpler manufacturing
                        machinery should be especially favored.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese can gain prosperity so as to buy what they do not produce only by
                        developing native productions. Special trade favors to any power on the
                        ground of reciprocity, territories, occupation, oi spheres of influence
                        should be guarded against by stringent favored-nation clause now and for the
                        future. It is necessary to secure increased access to interior markets.
                        Forming of Chinese revenues should be restricted if not wholly discontinued,
                        and an honest and uniform Imperial fiscal system be substituted. Advisory
                        representation should be had by the principal commercial powers in the

                    <p>(Mr. Rockhill reports that the proposal for a lump indemnity of £40,000,000
                        was to-day discussed by the diplomatic corps, none of members have
                        instructions to make definite reply. None are ready to accept that sum,
                        though generally favorable to the principle that it should be within the
                        power of China to pay. The British minister ‘stated that the sum should be
                        reasonable and payment not create financial embarrassment. The Japanese
                        minister thought that consideration may have to be given to the necessity of
                        reduction of claims. The Russian minister agreed that the principal
                        resources of the Empire should be taken into account. The German minister
                        thinks that if China can pay all the claims generosity is unnecessary.
                        Report of commission on the financial resources is awaited before any
                        further discussion. It is generally believed that our limit is too low.
                        Report will be submitted soon, when he will bring up the proposal again.</p>
                    <p>The Italian minister stated war claim to May 1 to be 70,000,000 francs; each
                        month thereafter, 2,500,000 francs. After July 1, interest of 200,000
                        francs. All other claims amount to about 21,500,000 francs. The Russian
                        minister stated war claim to May 15 to be 170,000,000 rubles, including
                        railroad destruction; 2,000,000 rubles monthly war expenses thereafter.
                        Private claims, from 6,000,000 to 8,000,000 rubles.)</p>

                    <p>(Mr. Rockhill reports that the diplomatic corps agreed to inform the Chinese
                        plenipotentiaries that the sum total of the disbursements of the powers
                        amount to about £67,500,000, including military expenses and private claims
                        down to July 1; that this amount will considerably increase after that date
                        if military occupation is prolonged. They will ask China to formally admit
                        liability and state what financial measures it proposes to take to pay
                        debt.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rockhill agreed to the note with the formal understanding that it was not
                        in any sense a demand, nor did it represent the final figure of indemnity to
                        be demanded, but was merely a means of eliciting formal reply of China as to
                        limit of ability to pay and measures it proposes to take.</p>
                    <p>The French and Russian ministers are instructed to urge loan with joint
                        guaranty; Austrian and Japanese ministers are favorable to loan with
                        guaranty; British and German ministers are noncommital; the others are
                        without instructions, but will probably favor it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rockhill held out little probability of his Government accepting, stating
                        that he saw grave difficulties in the way of joint guaranty; he thinks it
                        should be opposed, unless, perhaps, we got a reduction of <pb n="371"
                            xml:id="pg_371" facs="0377"/>indemnity to about £40,000,000, with
                        compensating commercial privileges. China will, it is estimated, have to pay
                        23 per cent commissions and 7 per cent interest for loan without guaranty;
                        with guaranty, 7 per cent commission and 4 per cent interest.</p>

                    <p>(Mr. Hay states that the aggregate sum mentioned appears exorbitant, and
                        repeats that this Government is willing to reduce by one-half its already
                        reasonable claim if the other powers will make similar reduction. There are
                        grave objections to joint guaranty, but the President would agree to it,
                        subject to the action of Congress, rather than subject China to the
                        necessity of paying so enormous a commission. Mr. Rockhill’s suggestion in
                        regard to reducing the total amount, with compensating commercial
                        advantages, is strongly approved.</p>
                    <p>The President wishes Mr. Rockhill to propose that each power accept bonds of
                        China without international guaranty. Such bonds would be accepted by this
                        Government at 3 per cent, and without commission, for its share of
                        indemnity. * * *)</p>

                        200,000,000 taels, proposed by the United States, is considered by it too
                        generous, and it suggests that it be fixed <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372"
                            facs="0378"/>at 400,000,000 taels, by which all claims, up to July 1,
                        are to be covered; it would allow no claim for military occupations after
                        that date; the powers would receive from China bonds at par, bearing 4 per
                        cent interest, and a sinking fund at a rate of one-half of 1 per cent per
                        annum would be provided. Provisions for payment would be made from an
                        increase of 5 per cent effective on foreign imports, and the proceeds of
                        native customs, and the tax on salt. China would issue three-fourths of the
                        bonds at first, and the remainder after improvement of her finances.).</p>

                        scaling of the indemnity has been practically declined of by the action of
                        the foreign representatives, who have, by a vote, decided that the amount of
                        expenses actually incurred by the powers, as well as the claims of private
                        persons, shall be demanded of China as an indemnity. The question whether it
                        would be advisable to limit the amount to 450,000,000 taels, by which all
                        claims up to July 1 are covered, was reserved, thus making it possible that
                        all subsequent claims for military occupation will be stopped. An increase
                        of import duties to 5 per cent, effective and without compensating
                        commercial advantages, for the purpose of supplying funds for the indemnity,
                        was agreed to by all the plenipotentiaries except Mr. Rockhill, who insisted

                    <p>(Mr. Rockhill reports that the following agreement has been reached by the
                        diplomatic corps in regard to the indemnity: The revenues from native
                        customs, the available balance of maritime customs and salt tax, without any
                        foreign control over the service as it exists, and an increase of tariff
                        duties to 5 per cent effective ad valorem will be reserved for the payment
                        of interests. He asks approval of his action in agreeing to the advance of
                        duties, which he did, because nothing better could be obtained on the
                        following conditions, that the tariff shall be revised and specific duties
                        substituted for ad valorem duties; that China will participate financially
                        in the improvement of water approaches of Shanghai and Tientsin, and that
                        the regulations on inland navigation shall be revised so that no class of
                        shipping shall be excluded. The 5 per cent duty has been agreed to by all
                        the powers without any commercial compensation, and any partial abolition of
                        likin dues is opposed by Great Britain.)</p>

                        be considered as the indemnity agreed upon. Japan can only borrow at 5 per
                        cent, and will consequently lose heavily at that rate. She submits the
                        difficulty of her position. Asks if Mr. Hay can suggest a way of securing
                        her against loss. The same question has been telegraphed by the British and
                        German ministers to their Governments. Prospects for early termination of

                        and Russia that, in event of irregularity in making payments by China, the
                        eventual raising of the tariff to 10 per cent to supply deficiency be
                        discussed; all the powers to make all reservations they choose to whenever

                        affords satisfaction to Russia and France for relinquishing guaranteed loan

                        per cent interest formally accepted, Japan waiving any preferential
                        treatment. A plan of amortization also agreed upon. Russian minister

                        to Mr. Rockhill’s dispatch No. 67). He has voted in favor of two years’
                        limit, but has expressed no opinion on mode of enforcement. Formal surrender
